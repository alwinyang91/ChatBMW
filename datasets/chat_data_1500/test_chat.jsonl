Customer racing has been a cornerstone of BMW M Motorsport’s programme for decades. In the 2025 season, it gains a new dimension as the BMW M Racing Academy is launching as a development programme for GT4-category racers. The “Class of 2025” includes Spain’s Nerea Martí, Turkey’s Berkay Besler, Matthew Million from the USA, and Germany’s Niels Tröger. This quartet impressed BMW M Motorsport’s decision-makers during a rigorous selection process and will undergo a unique development programme in 2025, unparalleled in customer racing. BMW M works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN) will mentor the participants, while Dirk Adorf (GER) will contribute his extensive experience from previous talent development initiatives, including the BMW Junior Team.\n\nIn early November, a total of twelve candidates were invited to Munich (GER) to participate in the selection process for the BMW M Racing Academy. The programme offered unique challenges not typically accessible to customer racers. Candidates underwent a session in the BMW M Motorsport simulator, which is normally reserved for BMW M works drivers. Formula Medicine experts tested their physical and mental capabilities. The programme also included a setup session using the automotive gaming simulator on the iRacing platform and an interview with BMW M Motorsport’s communication experts.\n\nThe selection process results determined the four members of the “Class of 2025”: Nerea Martí, Berkay Besler, Matthew Million, and Niels Tröger. A prerequisite for participating in the BMW M Racing Academy is competing in the BMW M4 GT4, underscoring the programme’s focus on customer racing.\n\n22-year-old Martí is currently competing for BMW Spain in the Iberian Supercars Series. In 2023, she claimed the title in the Spanish GT Championship with the BMW M4 GT4. Martí has also made a name for herself in recent years in single-seater racing through her performances in the W Series and the F1 Academy.\n\n25-year-old Besler has been racing for Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport in the GT4 European Series with the BMW M4 GT4 since 2021. He achieved his best season in 2023, finishing third in the Silver class. In 2022, he became the champion of the Prototype Cup Germany.\n\n24-year-old Million completed his debut season in 2024 with AutoTechnic Racing in GT4 America, driving the BMW M4 GT4. Prior to this, he enjoyed success with the BMW M3 E36 in various US amateur series. Since 2023, he has also been active as a driver coach.\n\n22-year-old Tröger made headlines in 2023 by winning the Karting World Championship, becoming the first German to achieve this feat since DTM record champion Bernd Schneider (GER) 43 years ago. In the most recent season, he transitioned to the GT4 category, competing with FK Performance Motorsport in the BMW M4 GT4 in ADAC GT4 Germany.\n\nBjörn Lellmann , Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: “I am incredibly proud that with the BMW M Racing Academy, we are offering our customer racers a unique and exclusive development programme that money cannot buy. Our customers have always played an exceptionally important role for us, and with the BMW M Racing Academy, we are further strengthening our commitment. Congratulations to our four selected members of the ‘Class of 2025’ – Nerea Martí, Berkay Besler, Matthew Million, and Niels Tröger. They will experience a programme next year that provides insights previously reserved for works racing. The selection process in Munich was an excellent preview of what is to come. I was impressed by the high level of all the candidates, which made the final decision a difficult one.

HERE Technologies, the leading location data and technology platform, today announced that the BMW Group is utilizing the HERE HD Live Map, HERE’s high-definition map to enable hands-free driving in the United States and Canada. HERE is one of the world’s first companies to provide high-definition maps for Level 2+ automated driving capabilities in series production vehicles. This is the result of a long-standing collaboration between BMW and HERE on next-generation mapping capabilities.\n\n7 Series is the first BMW series production vehicle to use HERE HD Live Map for hands-free driving\n\nThe BMW Group first introduced hands-free driving at a maximum speed of 40 mph/60 km/h in 2018. Now, the all-new BMW 7 Series is the premium automaker’s first production vehicle to launch with SAE Level 2+ automated functionalities at a maximum speed of 85 mph/130 km/h. With the HERE HD Live Map on board, this function enables hands-free driving on interstates and highways, provided drivers remain focused and ready to take control. Additionally, the HERE platform provides functionality for the vehicle’s navigation system to display in real-time where the SAE Level 2+ function can be activated safely. Over time, the HERE HD Live Map will be integrated into additional BMW models as automated driving capabilities increase across vehicles, roadways and regions.\n\n“A digital HD map is essential for highly automated driving. HERE HD Live Map is rich and reliable: it provides road geometry, route profile and traffic signs – all on a global scale,” said Dr. Nicolai Martin, Senior Vice President Driving Experience at BMW Group. “We have been working with HERE for many years to bring highly automated driving to market, and we are now thrilled to see the result of our collaboration finally come to life. Together, we are going one step further in delivering on our promise to provide a superior driving experience to our customers.”\n\n“We’re delighted to see our HERE HD Live Map enable automated driving at Level 2+ for BMW series production vehicles. This collaboration demonstrates the value of maps for highly automated driving. We look forward to supporting the expansion of Level 2+ to all types of roads,” said Fred Hessabi, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer at HERE Technologies.\n\nHERE HD Live Map a key component to automated driving safety and user comfort\n\nThe HERE HD Live Map consists of rich, highly accurate and fresh layers of data to support the vehicle in knowing exactly where it is on the road and what road features lie ahead.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at summarizing BMW news articles. Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group is a company that takes the long view, that is profitable – even in a volatile environment – and that always charts its own course. In 2022, we grew in three different ways: with the complex challenges we faced, with e-mobility and with our earnings. On the one hand, our focus is on operational excellence in the “here and now”. We know we can handle complexity. We can pivot quickly if the situation requires – and that makes the company more resilient than ever. On the other hand, we consistently maintain our course for the future, realising our goals with determination. A good example of this is our BEV ramp-up since 2013. We steer it to closely track growing demand. Since the start of the BMW i3, we have put more than half a million all-electric BMW and MINI vehicles on the roads worldwide. In fact, we sold more than 215,000 all-electric vehicles just last year. That’s more than double the number from 2021 – despite the difficult supply situation. We deliver on our promises. That has been a differentiating factor for BMW for over a hundred years.\n\nWith our strong BEV growth, we are leaving established competitors far behind – not to mention many of the BEV-only manufacturers from the US and Asia who are new to the market. This is true both in absolute terms and in terms of our growth dynamic. And we continue to up the pace. Demand remains strong. That’s why all-electric vehicles are expected to account for 15 percent of our global sales this year already. This will mean another big leap and the highest absolute increase we have targeted to date. We have clearly defined the next milestones for our BEV ramp-up: a fifth of overall sales in 2024; a quarter in 2025 and a third in 2026. With this momentum, more than half the vehicles we sell worldwide will be all-electric BEFORE 2030. It goes without saying that the percentage in Europe will already be well over 50 percent by then. If individual markets or regions demand 100 percent e-mobility at a certain point in time – we will be ready and able to deliver.\n\nBMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad already offer fully-electric cars and two-wheelers in practically all the market segments we serve. We already have a dozen fully-electric cars in our line-up this year, covering a range of different customer requirements. Last year, I was only able to show you the profile of the BMW i7* and the BMW iX1*. Today, those production models are standing right here beside me. Both vehicles are fresh on the market – and impressing the media and customers alike. With all our BEVs, we are attracting an especially high number of new customers across different segments. That is another reason why we are expanding our BEV range in a deliberate manner. And we are not done yet.\n\nIn 2023, we will take the next big step to fulfil the drivers technological needs of our customers around the globe. Later this year, we will be releasing the latest version of the world’s most successful business sedan on the market: the new BMW 5 Series – including of course the fully-electric i5. This will also be followed in 2024 by two plug-in hybrid variants. The official launch is still a few months away. But, behind me you can at least see the camouflaged i5. Production will get underway in the summer. From October onwards, the i5 will initially be released in Korea, Europe and the US.\n\nBMW M fans get to experience the perfect harmony of e-mobility and dynamic performance in a very unique way. BMW M reported a record year to mark its 50th anniversary in 2022. The best-selling M model was the fully-electric BMW i4 M50*. I think, that speaks for itself. It is another reason why we are also bringing the new BMW i5 onto the market as an M Performance model.\n\nToday, I can also announce the new BMW 5 Series Touring, which is particularly popular in Europe. Our Touring fans will be excited to hear that an all-electric version of the Touring will also be available for the first time from spring 2024. That is our unique selling point in this segment. I can also officially confirm the new BMW X2 and the all-electric iX2. This is already BMW’s second BEV offering in the high-volume compact class. Like the iX1*, we are building the iX2 in Germany, at our Regensburg plant. It will be launched towards the end of the year. E-mobility is a priority for us – and we measure ourselves against this. That is why, starting this year, the BEV share of total sales will be a KPI for our management of the company.\n\nIn addition to BEVs, we are also seeing particularly strong growth in the profitable high-end premium and luxury segments. Specifically, we anticipate growth here in the mid-double-digit percentage range in 2023 – thanks to attractive models like the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW X7, the BMW XM* and the Rolls-Royce model family. These will be joined in the spring by updates to the BMW X5 and the BMW X6. From 2025 onwards, the NEUE KLASSE will bring added momentum to sales of our all-electric vehicles. We intend to release at least six models onto the market within 24 months of the start of production. But before we look ahead to the future, here's Nicolas Peter to talk about our key figures for financial year 2022.\n\nOn the road to the NEUE KLASSE, we revealed our digital vision Vehicle at the CES in Las Vegas. And this was really a sensation! At the BMW Group, we deliver on our promises. That is our pledge.\n\nThe same applies to digital innovations. We are making mobility a totally new experience for our customers. Our revolutionary Head-Up Display blurs the lines between reality and the virtual world. Augmented Reality even enhances the real world. No one has ever imagined and implemented it like this in a car before. We call it BMW Panoramic Vision. And it is certainly not science fiction. In 2025 – just two years away – a standard-production version of this technology will be used in the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nAt the CES we demonstrated how we can integrate software and hardware into a perfect customer experience. Behind a digitalised vehicle like our Vision Vehicle Dee, there stands a digital company. What others are only just announcing has long been reality for us.\n\nOne thing is clear: It is our employees who are developing these innovations. We are creating the knowledge and tools needed to identify and implement digital potential in every area of responsibility.\n\nVideo Ilka Horstmeier:\n\nWe showed how the circular economy can be implemented in our industry with our BMW i Vision Circular two years ago. The key to all this is close cooperation with our partners in the supplier network.\n\nVideos Dr Joachim Post and Dr Milan Nedeljković :\n\nBMW iFACTORY – that is the future for our global production network. We are expanding this concept in great strides – in all major regions of the world. We completed two key projects in China last year: In April, the expansion at our Dadong location began operations. This is where we are localising the BMW X5 as a long-wheelbase version for the Chinese market. In late June, we also put another plant into service at our Tiexi site. The plant is fully geared towards e-mobility and was planned entirely in a virtual environment.\n\nIn Europe, at around the same time, we laid the foundation stone for our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary. It should become a pioneer in sustainable and climate-friendly production. This plant was also planned completely digitally. Production of the NEUE KLASSE will get underway there in 2025. From then on, others will follow in rapid succession: Our main plant in Munich in 2026. In 2027, our Mexican plant in San Luis Potosí. With other locations to follow.\n\nWe are also enabling our largest plant worldwide, Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina, for production of all-electric vehicles. We are investing over 1.7 billion dollars in the site. By 2030, we will have six pure electric models coming off the production line in the US. We will be manufacturing the high-voltage batteries needed for this at a completely new plant in nearby Woodruff. Woodruff is just one example of our local production of high‑voltage batteries around the world.\n\nAt the moment, we are manufacturing high-voltage batteries for our current electric models in Germany and in China, at our Shenyang location.\n\nDebrecen in Hungary, San Luis Potosí in Mexico and Woodruff will complete this network for the sixth generation of battery technology in the future. This “local for local” approach enables us to secure our BEV ramp-up in individual regions of the world and significantly increase our resilience to unforeseen events.Our world is diverse and individual at the same time.\n\nWe believe that the mobility of the future also needs more than one leg to stand on, in addition to battery-electric drivetrains. We see hydrogen-electric vehicles as a meaningful complement to e-mobility – even if with something of a time lag. Hydrogen has a lot of potential. Globally and across all industries we are already on the way to becoming a hydrogen society. At BMW, we could even envision a production vehicle in the second half of this decade. Hydrogen could also be a possible drive technology for the NEUE KLASSE going forward. Technologically, we are ready.\n\nWe proved this a few weeks ago when we presented our BMW iX5 Hydrogen* in Antwerp. A range of around 500 kilometres in the WLTP cycle and refuelling in three to four minutes speak for themselves. We are now sending a pilot fleet out into selected markets to gain customer experience. But let's leave the slightly more distant hydrogen technology and come back to what our customers can look forward to today and in the near future.\n\nMINI will be really taking off in the next few years. By the early 2030s, the brand will be electric-only. This is what the pioneering “NEW MINI Family” is all about. A total of three new electric models will be coming onto the market next year. Standing next to me is the new MINI Cooper Electric*. And I’m confident – the fan community is also going to love the MINI Countryman and the MINI Aceman.\n\nRolls-Royce will be all-electric from the start of the next decade. The Spectre is being released at exactly the right time. We have never had so many pre-orders for a new Rolls-Royce model.\n\nBMW Motorrad already relies solely on e-drives in urban settings. Following on from the CE 04, the CE 02 is mainly designed to appeal to young people living in the city. The Concept is standing right here beside me. Today's perfect customer experience also entails personalised communication with customers in the worlds they live in.\n\nFocused on the customer, with highly attractive products for all brands and a new sales model – this is how we are heading into the future together with our retailers. We have broad support from our sales partners. This collaborative approach is what sets us apart from others. Direct sales, with agents acting as sales representatives, will be a key element of our realigned sales structure.\n\nWe have already successfully tested this as part of a pilot project in South Africa. We launched this model in China for MINI on the first of March. It will be followed next year by the European sales region for MINI. We plan to transition the BMW brand in Europe from 2026 onwards.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAt the BMW Group, we move body, heart and mind. This aspiration also encapsulates our impact on society, as a value-based, value-creating company. And, above all: We deliver on our promises. You will always be able to rely on the BMW Group for this in the future.\n\nIn 2023, our strategic approach will once again keep us on track for success. We will meet current requirements with our fresh, technologically broad product line-up and with our operational excellence. At the same time, we will remain focused on our course for the future.\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we are embarking on a new era of mobility. And, at the same time, taking the company into the next dimension.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption/emissions data: BMW i7 xDrive60: Power consumption in kWh/100 km combined: 19.6-18.4 WLTP.

In 2022, we grew in three different ways: with the complex challenges we faced, with e-mobility and with our earnings. On the one hand, our focus is on operational excellence in the “here and now”. We know we can handle complexity. We can pivot quickly if the situation requires – and that makes the company more resilient than ever. On the other hand, we consistently maintain our course for the future, realising our goals with determination. A good example of this is our BEV ramp-up since 2013. We steer it to closely track growing demand. Since the start of the BMW i3, we have put more than half a million all-electric BMW and MINI vehicles on the roads worldwide. In fact, we sold more than 215,000 all-electric vehicles just last year. That’s more than double the number from 2021 – despite the difficult supply situation. We deliver on our promises. That has been a differentiating factor for BMW for over a hundred years.\n\nWith our strong BEV growth, we are leaving established competitors far behind – not to mention many of the BEV-only manufacturers from the US and Asia who are new to the market. This is true both in absolute terms and in terms of our growth dynamic. And we continue to up the pace. Demand remains strong. That’s why all-electric vehicles are expected to account for 15 percent of our global sales this year already. This will mean another big leap and the highest absolute increase we have targeted to date. We have clearly defined the next milestones for our BEV ramp-up: a fifth of overall sales in 2024; a quarter in 2025 and a third in 2026. With this momentum, more than half the vehicles we sell worldwide will be all-electric BEFORE 2030. It goes without saying that the percentage in Europe will already be well over 50 percent by then. If individual markets or regions demand 100 percent e-mobility at a certain point in time – we will be ready and able to deliver.\n\nBMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad already offer fully-electric cars and two-wheelers in practically all the market segments we serve. We already have a dozen fully-electric cars in our line-up this year, covering a range of different customer requirements. Last year, I was only able to show you the profile of the BMW i7* and the BMW iX1*. Today, those production models are standing right here beside me. Both vehicles are fresh on the market – and impressing the media and customers alike. With all our BEVs, we are attracting an especially high number of new customers across different segments. That is another reason why we are expanding our BEV range in a deliberate manner. And we are not done yet.\n\nIn 2023, we will take the next big step to fulfil the drivers technological needs of our customers around the globe. Later this year, we will be releasing the latest version of the world’s most successful business sedan on the market: the new BMW 5 Series – including of course the fully-electric i5. This will also be followed in 2024 by two plug-in hybrid variants. The official launch is still a few months away. But, behind me you can at least see the camouflaged i5. Production will get underway in the summer. From October onwards, the i5 will initially be released in Korea, Europe and the US.\n\nBMW M fans get to experience the perfect harmony of e-mobility and dynamic performance in a very unique way. BMW M reported a record year to mark its 50th anniversary in 2022. The best-selling M model was the fully-electric BMW i4 M50*. I think, that speaks for itself.

We will meet current requirements with our fresh, technologically broad product line-up and with our operational excellence. At the same time, we will remain focused on our course for the future.\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we are embarking on a new era of mobility. And, at the same time, taking the company into the next dimension.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption/emissions data: BMW i7 xDrive60: Power consumption in kWh/100 km combined: 19.6-18.4 WLTP.

In 2022, we grew in three different ways: with the complex challenges we faced, with e-mobility and with our earnings. On the one hand, our focus is on operational excellence in the “here and now”. We know we can handle complexity. We can pivot quickly if the situation requires – and that makes the company more resilient than ever. On the other hand, we consistently maintain our course for the future, realising our goals with determination. A good example of this is our BEV ramp-up since 2013. We steer it to closely track growing demand. Since the start of the BMW i3, we have put more than half a million all-electric BMW and MINI vehicles on the roads worldwide. In fact, we sold more than 215,000 all-electric vehicles just last year. That’s more than double the number from 2021 – despite the difficult supply situation. We deliver on our promises. That has been a differentiating factor for BMW for over a hundred years.\n\nWith our strong BEV growth, we are leaving established competitors far behind – not to mention many of the BEV-only manufacturers from the US and Asia who are new to the market. This is true both in absolute terms and in terms of our growth dynamic. And we continue to up the pace. Demand remains strong. That’s why all-electric vehicles are expected to account for 15 percent of our global sales this year already. This will mean another big leap and the highest absolute increase we have targeted to date. We have clearly defined the next milestones for our BEV ramp-up: a fifth of overall sales in 2024; a quarter in 2025 and a third in 2026. With this momentum, more than half the vehicles we sell worldwide will be all-electric BEFORE 2030. It goes without saying that the percentage in Europe will already be well over 50 percent by then. If individual markets or regions demand 100 percent e-mobility at a certain point in time – we will be ready and able to deliver.\n\nBMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad already offer fully-electric cars and two-wheelers in practically all the market segments we serve. We already have a dozen fully-electric cars in our line-up this year, covering a range of different customer requirements. Last year, I was only able to show you the profile of the BMW i7* and the BMW iX1*. Today, those production models are standing right here beside me. Both vehicles are fresh on the market – and impressing the media and customers alike. With all our BEVs, we are attracting an especially high number of new customers across different segments. That is another reason why we are expanding our BEV range in a deliberate manner. And we are not done yet.\n\nIn 2023, we will take the next big step to fulfil the drivers technological needs of our customers around the globe. Later this year, we will be releasing the latest version of the world’s most successful business sedan on the market: the new BMW 5 Series – including of course the fully-electric i5. This will also be followed in 2024 by two plug-in hybrid variants. The official launch is still a few months away. But, behind me you can at least see the camouflaged i5. Production will get underway in the summer. From October onwards, the i5 will initially be released in Korea, Europe and the US.\n\nBMW M fans get to experience the perfect harmony of e-mobility and dynamic performance in a very unique way. BMW M reported a record year to mark its 50th anniversary in 2022. The best-selling M model was the fully-electric BMW i4 M50*. I think, that speaks for itself. It is another reason why we are also bringing the new BMW i5 onto the market as an M Performance model.\n\nToday, I can also announce the new BMW 5 Series Touring, which is particularly popular in Europe. Our Touring fans will be excited to hear that an all-electric version of the Touring will also be available for the first time from spring 2024. That is our unique selling point in this segment. I can also officially confirm the new BMW X2 and the all-electric iX2. This is already BMW’s second BEV offering in the high-volume compact class. Like the iX1*, we are building the iX2 in Germany, at our Regensburg plant. It will be launched towards the end of the year. E-mobility is a priority for us – and we measure ourselves against this. That is why, starting this year, the BEV share of total sales will be a KPI for our management of the company.\n\nIn addition to BEVs, we are also seeing particularly strong growth in the profitable high-end premium and luxury segments. Specifically, we anticipate growth here in the mid-double-digit percentage range in 2023 – thanks to attractive models like the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW X7, the BMW XM* and the Rolls-Royce model family. These will be joined in the spring by updates to the BMW X5 and the BMW X6. From 2025 onwards, the NEUE KLASSE will bring added momentum to sales of our all-electric vehicles. We intend to release at least six models onto the market within 24 months of the start of production. But before we look ahead to the future, here's Nicolas Peter to talk about our key figures for financial year 2022.\n\nOn the road to the NEUE KLASSE, we revealed our digital vision Vehicle at the CES in Las Vegas. And this was really a sensation! At the BMW Group, we deliver on our promises. That is our pledge.\n\nThe same applies to digital innovations. We are making mobility a totally new experience for our customers. Our revolutionary Head-Up Display blurs the lines between reality and the virtual world. Augmented Reality even enhances the real world. No one has ever imagined and implemented it like this in a car before. We call it BMW Panoramic Vision. And it is certainly not science fiction. In 2025 – just two years away – a standard-production version of this technology will be used in the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nAt the CES we demonstrated how we can integrate software and hardware into a perfect customer experience. Behind a digitalised vehicle like our Vision Vehicle Dee, there stands a digital company. What others are only just announcing has long been reality for us.\n\nOne thing is clear: It is our employees who are developing these innovations. We are creating the knowledge and tools needed to identify and implement digital potential in every area of responsibility.\n\nVideo Ilka Horstmeier:\n\nWe showed how the circular economy can be implemented in our industry with our BMW i Vision Circular two years ago. The key to all this is close cooperation with our partners in the supplier network.\n\nVideos Dr Joachim Post and Dr Milan Nedeljković :\n\nBMW iFACTORY – that is the future for our global production network. We are expanding this concept in great strides – in all major regions of the world. We completed two key projects in China last year: In April, the expansion at our Dadong location began operations. This is where we are localising the BMW X5 as a long-wheelbase version for the Chinese market. In late June, we also put another plant into service at our Tiexi site. The plant is fully geared towards e-mobility and was planned entirely in a virtual environment.\n\nIn Europe, at around the same time, we laid the foundation stone for our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary. It should become a pioneer in sustainable and climate-friendly production. This plant was also planned completely digitally. Production of the NEUE KLASSE will get underway there in 2025. From then on, others will follow in rapid succession: Our main plant in Munich in 2026. In 2027, our Mexican plant in San Luis Potosí. With other locations to follow.\n\nWe are also enabling our largest plant worldwide, Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina, for production of all-electric vehicles. We are investing over 1.7 billion dollars in the site. By 2030, we will have six pure electric models coming off the production line in the US. We will be manufacturing the high-voltage batteries needed for this at a completely new plant in nearby Woodruff. Woodruff is just one example of our local production of high‑voltage batteries around the world.\n\nAt the moment, we are manufacturing high-voltage batteries for our current electric models in Germany and in China, at our Shenyang location.\n\nDebrecen in Hungary, San Luis Potosí in Mexico and Woodruff will complete this network for the sixth generation of battery technology in the future. This “local for local” approach enables us to secure our BEV ramp-up in individual regions of the world and significantly increase our resilience to unforeseen events.Our world is diverse and individual at the same time.\n\nWe believe that the mobility of the future also needs more than one leg to stand on, in addition to battery-electric drivetrains. We see hydrogen-electric vehicles as a meaningful complement to e-mobility – even if with something of a time lag. Hydrogen has a lot of potential. Globally and across all industries we are already on the way to becoming a hydrogen society. At BMW, we could even envision a production vehicle in the second half of this decade. Hydrogen could also be a possible drive technology for the NEUE KLASSE going forward. Technologically, we are ready.\n\nWe proved this a few weeks ago when we presented our BMW iX5 Hydrogen* in Antwerp. A range of around 500 kilometres in the WLTP cycle and refuelling in three to four minutes speak for themselves. We are now sending a pilot fleet out into selected markets to gain customer experience. But let's leave the slightly more distant hydrogen technology and come back to what our customers can look forward to today and in the near future.\n\nMINI will be really taking off in the next few years. By the early 2030s, the brand will be electric-only. This is what the pioneering “NEW MINI Family” is all about. A total of three new electric models will be coming onto the market next year. Standing next to me is the new MINI Cooper Electric*. And I’m confident – the fan community is also going to love the MINI Countryman and the MINI Aceman.\n\nRolls-Royce will be all-electric from the start of the next decade. The Spectre is being released at exactly the right time. We have never had so many pre-orders for a new Rolls-Royce model.\n\nBMW Motorrad already relies solely on e-drives in urban settings. Following on from the CE 04, the CE 02 is mainly designed to appeal to young people living in the city. The Concept is standing right here beside me. Today's perfect customer experience also entails personalised communication with customers in the worlds they live in.\n\nFocused on the customer, with highly attractive products for all brands and a new sales model – this is how we are heading into the future together with our retailers. We have broad support from our sales partners. This collaborative approach is what sets us apart from others. Direct sales, with agents acting as sales representatives, will be a key element of our realigned sales structure.\n\nWe have already successfully tested this as part of a pilot project in South Africa. We launched this model in China for MINI on the first of March. It will be followed next year by the European sales region for MINI. We plan to transition the BMW brand in Europe from 2026 onwards.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAt the BMW Group, we move body, heart and mind.

The 45th Ryder Cup on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park near New York will be remembered for a long time. Since 1927, the enthralling team duel between the best golfers from the USA and Europe has written countless legendary stories. With their 15-13 victory on foreign soil, the defending champions added another stunning chapter. On Saturday, the Europeans achieved the largest lead (11.5-4.5) any team has held after two days since Europe began competing against the USA in 1979. In Sunday’s singles matches, the Americans nearly overturned what seemed like an insurmountable deficit, before Shane Lowry (IRL) delivered the decisive half-point on the way to the fifth away victory for Team Europe since 1979.\n\nCaptain Luke Donald (ENG) continued to maintain his flawless Ryder Cup record. As a player, the former world number one won the Ryder Cup trophy in all four of his appearances (2004, 2006, 2010, and 2012). Now, as a captain, he has two triumphs to his name. Two years ago, Donald also led Team Europe to victory. Just as in Rome, Team Europe impressed in the heated atmosphere of Bethpage Black with a consistently strong team performance, hitting the ground running from the very start. The Europeans won all four foursome sessions on Friday and Saturday – a remarkable first as no team had ever even claimed the first three sessions before.\n\nJust when everything seemed to point to a landslide victory for the visitors, the tide turned dramatically on Sunday. The U.S. team took the lead in one singles match after another, and a sporting miracle suddenly seemed within reach. By the end of Sunday, Europe would win only a single match (Ludvig Åberg, SWE, against Patrick Cantlay) but still manage to hold on to their lead. It was Shane Lowry who ultimately secured the throphy by winning the 18th hole in his match against Russell Henley, earning the crucial half-point that brought the European team to 14 points – enough to retain the trophy as defending champions.\n\nOne of the most spectacular holes on Bethpage Black is the 14th, a short par 3 where numerous breathtaking shots and decisive moments unfolded over the last three days. BMW customers and guests had the privilege of witnessing this up close from the BMW House, which featured its own grandstand directly behind the tee. The 14th tee also served as the perfect stage for the new BMW iX3, the first series-produced Neue Klasse model. The new-generation BMW iX3 is a fully electric Sports Activity Vehicle that gives customers their first on-the-road taste of a whole new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure.\n\nBMW supported the smooth execution of the 45th Ryder Cup with a fleet of over 200 vehicles, ensuring safe transportation for members of the golf and event teams as well as BMW guests to and from the venue. Like BMW customers in many countries, they enjoyed the exclusive opportunity to follow the Ryder Cup live from inside their vehicles.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679-805km."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Team Europe defends the Ryder Cup with an 15-13 away victory +++ Record lead for the Europeans after two days +++ USA narrowly misses historic comeback +++ Luke Donald (ENG) remains unbeaten as both player and captain +++ Worldwide Partner BMW delivers fan experiences, a large shuttle fleet, and exclusive live broadcasts in BMW vehicles +++"}]}

The 9th BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy began with a beautiful African sunrise. After breaking camp, the riders packed their gear into bags, which were later transported to the next camp. As is tradition, 2 or 3 teams were randomly selected to handle the task of loading the bags onto the transportation truck. After a hearty breakfast, the moment everyone had been eagerly anticipating arrived. Stefanie Grund, Senior Project Manager of the event, waved the checkered flag, signaling the start of this year's adventure riding event. At 7:45 am local time, Team Brazil, the International Female Team, and Female Team Japan crossed the start line to cheers from the crowd.\n\nThe competitors formed groups of 7-9 motorcycles and, guided by their appointed Marshals, embarked on the first day and first Special Challenge. Only a few kilometers away from the Midgard Country Estate Lodge, still within its perimeter, the riders faced their first Special Challenge.\n\nDay 1, Special Challenge 1: The Namibia Welcome Trial. Near the ruins of an abandoned copper mine, the participants lined up their bikes at the starting point. The first rider’s departure marked the start of the timing for the challenge, with the other two riders (or one for a female team) following after a 5-second interval. Navigating a narrow, short trail through marked gates, the riders tackled sand, steps, drops, and tight turns. At the end, they parked their bikes side by side and rushed to the mine’s closed entrance to ring a bell. The timer stopped when the third rider hit the bell – an ideal warm-up for both the teams and the Marshals.\n\nAlthough the trial seemed easy initially, many riders were caught by surprise by its narrow passes. Rider Yasuhiro Maehara (212) from Team Japan said before the start of the challenge, “I think it’s very easy, and we’re really excited to get in there!” After completing the challenge with only a few deductions, he added, “I’m sorry. It was not so easy. I had to put my foot down a few times. The short corner and the deep sand caught me off-guard.”\n\nRider Dev Venkatesh (202) of Team India, said: “This was the best welcome for a special challenge for me. It is the first time I ride the 1300 GS off-road and it felt incredible. Smooth like butter. The challenge was short but very technical. You don’t have room for improvement, you have to stick to your lines. But we completed the trial without any mistakes and did a clean run, so we’re very excited to learn about the results.”\n\nRider Sunghee Kim (301) of Female Team South Korea, said: “Although it was an easy course, we had a little bit of hard time. But we didn’t drop the bike, which was great. And we feel very welcome,” quoting the name of the special challenge.\n\nLeaving behind this historic estate's lush, serene landscape along the Swakop River, known for its acacia woodlands, wildlife sightings, and scenic views, the riders headed west. The nearly 200-kilometer ride offered a real warm-up, with constantly changing terrain from hardpacked dirt to loose gravel and deep sand. The magnificence of Namibia began to unfold, with rock formations dating back nearly 700 million years. The riders experienced a sense of isolation, encountering little traffic along the way while staying alert for freely roaming cattle and wildlife crossings.\n\nNamibia’s rainy season typically begins in December and can last until April, but this past year, the last rain fell quite early, making the riding conditions extremely dusty. The lack of wind didn’t help, leaving both riders and motorcycles looking as though they’d been on an adventure of epic proportions. This added an element of danger, as the old Enduro saying warns: \"If there is dust and you can’t see the road, there will be a rock right in front of you.\" However, it was remarkable to see nature thriving despite the dry conditions, with trees growing on rocks, proving that even a little dirt is enough for a seed to sprout.\n\nAfter the long and dusty ride, the riders arrived in Omaruru, a charming town known for its vineyards, art scene, and cultural heritage. Omaruru is home to local wineries, such as Kristall Kellerei, Namibia's only wine estate, which produces unique wines from specially adapted grape varieties. The town also boasts art galleries and the Omaruru Artist's Trail, where local artists display and sell their work.\n\nAfter a much needed refueling and lunch break, the riders were ready for their first true taste of Africa. Just a few kilometers from their afternoon stop, the second special challenge awaited them.\n\nDay 1, Special Challenge 2: The AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge. The trail led to a dry riverbed – synonymous with one thing: very deep sand. The riders had to navigate an extremely sandy riverbed and complete a marked course while being timed. It soon became clear why it was called \"the AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge,\" as they blasted through the sand, revving their engines to their limit, struggling to stay on their bikes and avoid getting stuck in the river bed. This was certainly no warm-up exercise and the roaring of the engines could be heard for many kilometers away.\n\nRider Marion Linder (331) of the Female Team Germany, said: “This was a very demanding challenge. The sand was very deep, but we got a real taste of Africa. In fact I even got it between my teeth.”\n\nRider Francisco Leyva (112) of Team Mexico, after a phenomenal performance in the deep sand, was asked how many years of sand training the team had, and he said: “Four days. That’s all the time we got with this bike. We don’t know and we don’t care about the results. Me and my friends are smiling, and that’s the best outcome.”\n\nThe day’s final challenge took the riders on a detour through a phenomenal cluster of jeep tracks with challenging uphills covered by loose rocks and deep sand, leading them to the Ai Aiba Rock Painting Lodge.

The 9th BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy began with a beautiful African sunrise. After breaking camp, the riders packed their gear into bags, which were later transported to the next camp. As is tradition, 2 or 3 teams were randomly selected to handle the task of loading the bags onto the transportation truck. After a hearty breakfast, the moment everyone had been eagerly anticipating arrived. Stefanie Grund, Senior Project Manager of the event, waved the checkered flag, signaling the start of this year's adventure riding event. At 7:45 am local time, Team Brazil, the International Female Team, and Female Team Japan crossed the start line to cheers from the crowd.\n\nThe competitors formed groups of 7-9 motorcycles and, guided by their appointed Marshals, embarked on the first day and first Special Challenge. Only a few kilometers away from the Midgard Country Estate Lodge, still within its perimeter, the riders faced their first Special Challenge.\n\nDay 1, Special Challenge 1: The Namibia Welcome Trial. Near the ruins of an abandoned copper mine, the participants lined up their bikes at the starting point. The first rider’s departure marked the start of the timing for the challenge, with the other two riders (or one for a female team) following after a 5-second interval. Navigating a narrow, short trail through marked gates, the riders tackled sand, steps, drops, and tight turns. At the end, they parked their bikes side by side and rushed to the mine’s closed entrance to ring a bell. The timer stopped when the third rider hit the bell – an ideal warm-up for both the teams and the Marshals.\n\nAlthough the trial seemed easy initially, many riders were caught by surprise by its narrow passes. Rider Yasuhiro Maehara (212) from Team Japan said before the start of the challenge, “I think it’s very easy, and we’re really excited to get in there!” After completing the challenge with only a few deductions, he added, “I’m sorry. It was not so easy. I had to put my foot down a few times. The short corner and the deep sand caught me off-guard.”\n\nRider Dev Venkatesh (202) of Team India, said: “This was the best welcome for a special challenge for me. It is the first time I ride the 1300 GS off-road and it felt incredible. Smooth like butter. The challenge was short but very technical. You don’t have room for improvement, you have to stick to your lines. But we completed the trial without any mistakes and did a clean run, so we’re very excited to learn about the results.”\n\nRider Sunghee Kim (301) of Female Team South Korea, said: “Although it was an easy course, we had a little bit of hard time. But we didn’t drop the bike, which was great. And we feel very welcome,” quoting the name of the special challenge.\n\nLeaving behind this historic estate's lush, serene landscape along the Swakop River, known for its acacia woodlands, wildlife sightings, and scenic views, the riders headed west. The nearly 200-kilometer ride offered a real warm-up, with constantly changing terrain from hardpacked dirt to loose gravel and deep sand. The magnificence of Namibia began to unfold, with rock formations dating back nearly 700 million years. The riders experienced a sense of isolation, encountering little traffic along the way while staying alert for freely roaming cattle and wildlife crossings.\n\nNamibia’s rainy season typically begins in December and can last until April, but this past year, the last rain fell quite early, making the riding conditions extremely dusty. The lack of wind didn’t help, leaving both riders and motorcycles looking as though they’d been on an adventure of epic proportions. This added an element of danger, as the old Enduro saying warns: \"If there is dust and you can’t see the road, there will be a rock right in front of you.\" However, it was remarkable to see nature thriving despite the dry conditions, with trees growing on rocks, proving that even a little dirt is enough for a seed to sprout.\n\nAfter the long and dusty ride, the riders arrived in Omaruru, a charming town known for its vineyards, art scene, and cultural heritage. Omaruru is home to local wineries, such as Kristall Kellerei, Namibia's only wine estate, which produces unique wines from specially adapted grape varieties. The town also boasts art galleries and the Omaruru Artist's Trail, where local artists display and sell their work.\n\nAfter a much needed refueling and lunch break, the riders were ready for their first true taste of Africa. Just a few kilometers from their afternoon stop, the second special challenge awaited them.\n\nDay 1, Special Challenge 2: The AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge. The trail led to a dry riverbed – synonymous with one thing: very deep sand. The riders had to navigate an extremely sandy riverbed and complete a marked course while being timed. It soon became clear why it was called \"the AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge,\" as they blasted through the sand, revving their engines to their limit, struggling to stay on their bikes and avoid getting stuck in the river bed. This was certainly no warm-up exercise and the roaring of the engines could be heard for many kilometers away.\n\nRider Marion Linder (331) of the Female Team Germany, said: “This was a very demanding challenge. The sand was very deep, but we got a real taste of Africa. In fact I even got it between my teeth.”\n\nRider Francisco Leyva (112) of Team Mexico, after a phenomenal performance in the deep sand, was asked how many years of sand training the team had, and he said: “Four days. That’s all the time we got with this bike. We don’t know and we don’t care about the results. Me and my friends are smiling, and that’s the best outcome.”\n\nThe day’s final challenge took the riders on a detour through a phenomenal cluster of jeep tracks with challenging uphills covered by loose rocks and deep sand, leading them to the Ai Aiba Rock Painting Lodge. The camp, nestled amid imposing granite boulders at the foothills of the Erongo Mountain range, is rich in history. These ancient rock formations are the eroded remains of a volcanic complex around 130 million years old and are famous for countless rock painting sites, making Ai Aiba a mystical exploration of nature.\n\nDuring today’s route, the riders had also the chance to take pictures for the third Special Challenge, the Photo Challenge.

For the sixth time in a row - awesome! I am also pleased for Walkenhorst Motorsport, who dominated the season in the top SP9 Pro class and deservedly won the NLS Speed Trophy.

In North America, Zac Anderson won the Silver class in GT4 America. Charlie Postins and James Clay also won the title in the Am category. I was at Indianapolis myself and was able to congratulate them personally. When title races are so close, there are obviously disappointments.

The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) returns to historic ground. The sixth round of the 2023 season will take place at Donington Park (GBR), where the first WorldSBK race was held in 1988, from June 30 to July 2. The circuit near Nottingham (GBR) is also a special place for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Several significant successes have been celebrated there in the past. It is also the home race for the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, as well as Scott Redding (GBR) and Tom Sykes (GBR), who will once again stand in for injured Michael van der Mark (NED) this weekend.\n\nThe Bonovo action BMW Racing Team aims to continue its momentum from Misano four weeks ago (ITA) at Donington Park. At Misano, Garrett Gerloff (USA) achieved his best result of the season so far in a main race, finishing eighth in race two. His teammate Loris Baz (FRA) has used the break since Misano to train intensively and is confident of being 100% fit again after the injury he suffered at Mandalika (IDN).\n\nIntensive preparations and yearly get-together before the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team's home race.\n\nThe ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has a special tradition for its home race at Donington Park. At the beginning of race week, the entire team gathers at their headquarters in Guisborough (GBR), about two and a half hours’ drive from the race circuit. “Our team is based in the north of England, and after we set off for the first European event, all the trucks, equipment, bikes, and so on return to the UK for the first time. We’re practically on the road all year round,” explained Team Principal Shaun Muir. “After the races at Misano and before the races at Imola, this is the only time we have all the equipment here. It’s a good time to pack the trucks with new equipment, and we have the opportunity to prepare the bikes here in our workshop instead of doing it at the track on a Wednesday and Thursday. Here, we have several days and a suitable environment to get everything ready for Donington Park.” The 17,000-inhabitant town of Guisborough is Shaun Muir’s hometown. The team's headquarters was established in 2002 and has been developed there since.\n\nIn addition to the core team permanently based in Guisborough, the days leading up to the race weekend at Donington Park provide an opportunity for the international team to come together. “Our team members mainly have the chance to meet during race weekends. Our mechanics come from all over Europe, from the UK, Portugal, France, Poland, and so on and now they all gather here with us. It’s really like a big team get-together,” said Muir.\n\nNow everything is prepared, the trucks have arrived at Donington from Guisborough, and the race weekend can begin. It’s a track that team manager Muir finds exciting not only because it’s the home track: “I think what’s really special about Donington is that it’s a motorcycle track through and through. It has always been on the WorldSBK calendar; that's where it all started. Personally, I really like the circuit, and all the riders I speak to feel the same way. I believe that Donington Park is one of the top-three tracks for almost all riders, from the past and the present. It’s a real attraction. So, I’m really looking forward to it.”\n\nQuotes ahead of the Donington Park round.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After a four-week break, we are now continuing with three race weekends within five weeks. We want to start this series of events at Donington Park, Imola, and Most in the best possible way. We have very good memories associated with Donington Park. It's where we celebrated our first WorldSBK victory in 2012, and also after our factory comeback in 2019, we had successful outings at this circuit. The goal, of course, is to continue this trend. The track has been resurfaced, and in the initial practice sessions, we will see how it affects the handling and setup work. In any case, we are looking forward to exciting races at the historic Donington Park circuit and working hard to close in on the front.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, #31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I’m really looking forward to Donington Park this weekend. It’s a track where I had success in the past and so did BMW, so hopefully we can have a good weekend and find a setup quickly. It’s going to be slightly different because there’s new asphalt, but I think that’s good for us. We’ll see how it goes. I’m definitively looking forward to it.”\n\nScott Redding, #45 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I’m looking forward to my home round at Donington Park. Last year, it went well there for us and I would like to achieve similar results this time. That would be great in front of my home crowd. There is a new track surface so we need to see how that reacts with the tyres.”\n\nTom Sykes, #66 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am very much looking forward to Donington Park. It’s my home race and a circuit that I enjoy. It’s also the home race for the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Not only that, on the BMW in the past I’ve had some success there so we have that in mind and with what we learnt at Misano we can hopefully make the base setting of the BMW M 1000 RR a bit more suited to me. I’ve had a good chat with my crew-chief Marcus Eschenbacher in between with some ideas for Donington so I am really looking forward to the possibilities. We’ve also had some fantastic weather here in the UK and if that can continue into the weekend, I can imagine that it can provide excellent racing for the fans. Fingers crossed for a successful weekend.”\n\nLoris Baz, #76 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “It’s been quite a long time since Misano, but Misano was the first race where I was feeling good on the bike and not riding in pain, so it’s definitely a big improvement for me to be able to ride like this. I had a good three, four weeks to train even more. I’m back at 100 % now, so I’m really looking forward to this round. I love the Donington track! I hope we have more luck than at Misano where we had some issues. I’m confident of finally ride pain-free and enjoying riding the bike.

I had a good three, four weeks to train even more. I’m back at 100 % now, so I’m really looking forward to this round. I love the Donington track! I hope we have more luck than at Misano where we had some issues. I’m confident of finally ride pain-free and enjoying riding the bike.

The BMW Group is launching a vehicle with five different drivetrain technologies. The new BMW X5 will be the first model to offer customers a choice of battery electric, plug-in hybrid, petrol, diesel, and hydrogen fuel cell technology. The HyMoS (Hydrogen Mobility at Scale) initiative is designed to promote the development of hydrogen ecosystems and refueling stations in metropolitan areas and aims for an initial pilot implementation in Germany.\n\n“By launching the new BMW X5 with a choice of five drive system variants, we are once again demonstrating our leading position as a technology pioneer,” says Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development at an BMW event in New York. “Hydrogen has an essential part to play in global decarbonisation, which is why we are committed to driving the technology forward.”\n\nTechnology-open approach is a strategic success factor\n\nProduct diversity continues to be a key success factor for the BMW Group. A wide-ranging portfolio of drive systems – encompassing ICE engines, plug-in hybrids, battery electric drive systems and, starting with the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen in 2028, hydrogen fuel cell technology – lays the foundations for successfully meeting the varying demands and needs of customers worldwide both now and in the future.\n\nFlexible manufacturing structures and high levels of integration expertise enable this array of drive technologies to be implemented efficiently in the new BMW X5 range in terms of development, purchasing and production.

In the past, it is you who have always kept our home plant firmly on the road to success and it is you who will now lead it into the future together,” said Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Production. Plant Munich is currently undergoing major renovations for the start of production for the Neue Klasse in 2026, including the construction of three new buildings for the body shop and assembly complete with logistics areas.

BMW Group Plant Munich has had two busy days, and that despite the fact that not a single car has been built! To mark the 100th anniversary of the Munich parent plant, the BMW Group invited all employees from the Munich site to the anniversary celebrations along with their friends and family. Over the course of Saturday and Sunday, around 70,000 people came and enjoyed an exciting stage program, spectacular driving events and special insights into production.\n\n“Together we can make history! In the past, it is you who have always kept our home plant firmly on the road to success and it is you who will now lead it into the future together,” said Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Production. Plant Munich is currently undergoing major renovations for the start of production for the Neue Klasse in 2026, including the construction of three new buildings for the body shop and assembly complete with logistics areas. The head of Production made sure to emphasize: “We are quite literally leaving no stone unturned here, and yet you are keeping the plant up and running smoothly. This ambidexterity is exactly what makes the plant so special.”\n\nClocking up hours worked for charity donations\n\nIlka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Real Estate, also took the time to highlight the great dedication of the BMW workforce as she thanked the more than one thousand volunteers from all BMW locations across Munich who ensured the anniversary went off without a hitch and with such a great atmosphere. The hours the employees put in across both days were not remunerated but were instead donated in cash to five Munich charities.\n\n“The dedication shown by our employees is extraordinary. After all, we not only celebrated our plant anniversary, but also gave a helping hand to many Munich residents in need, raising a total of 150,000 euros for social causes. This reaffirms that we are a responsible employer that also takes responsibility for society. That’s just the BMW way,” added Horstmeier. Representatives from the Münchner Tafel, the Arche, Verein Zivilcourage für Alle, Horizont e.V. and the crisis intervention team at ASB München all accepted the donation vouchers in person from Ilka Horstmeier, Plant Manager Peter Weber and Martin Kimmich, Chairman of the General Works Council.\n\nTo symbolize the structural and technological transformation of Plant Munich, the Member of the Board for Production, Plant Manager and Works Council Chair filled a time capsule that will be integrated into the construction area of the new body shop. Construction of the new hall is set to begin imminently. “Despite the new work underway, we will continue to produce more than 900 premium quality BMWs every day at Plant Munich. We all have to show great flexibility and commitment to achieve this, but we see this challenge as an opportunity to shape a successful future for our plant. And there’s no doubt in my mind that, with such a motivated and highly qualified team, the plant’s transformation to e-mobility and the iFACTORY can only succeed,” said plant manager Peter Weber.\n\nBy employees for employees\n\nBMW employees not only handled most of the organization of the BMW anniversary celebrations themselves, but they also designed a diverse program over more than 25 different stations.

It embodies the essence of a GS: Get on, twist the throttle, have fun - with full control and maximum confidence. Its low weight, superior performance and perfect balance between agility and stability ensure a particularly intuitive riding experience. Thanks to its precise handling and typical GS expertise, it performs impressively both on and off the road. The F 450 GS is the perfect 'best buddy' for every riding situation. It is uncomplicated, robust, and always ready. It sets the benchmark for sporty adventure bikes in its class.\" Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW F 450 GS: BMW GS expertise in the 48 hp A2 class in the iconic BMW GS design.The new BMW F 450 GS marks the next step in the GS model family, specifically addressing the 48 hp A2 class with proven GS technology and iconic design.\n\nAt the EICMA international motorcycle show, BMW Motorrad gave a preview of a fully-fledged GS model already in 2024, which specifically addresses the steadily growing market segment of medium-sized displacement motorcycles.\n\nThe series version of the BMW F 450 GS consistently lives up to this claim: It is a versatile all-rounder that combines everyday usability, sporty dynamic performance, touring comfort, and off-road capabilities. In the \"GS Trophy\" equipment variant, it follows in the footsteps of the concept vehicle. It adopts its striking design language and high-quality, high-tech components, including magnesium parts for maximum performance and low weight.\n\nWith its balanced power-to-torque ratio, low weight, and characteristic GS ergonomics, the F 450 GS provides riding fun and confidence from the first meter. The new F 450 GS thus combines the classic GS spirit with a modern, accessible, and simultaneously powerful approach.\n\n\"With the BMW F 450 GS, we are addressing a particularly broad target audience. This motorcycle is aimed at anyone who values ​​maximum agility, versatility, pure riding pleasure, and cutting-edge technology – regardless of whether they are on the road every day, on long tours, or simply looking for a light, dynamic, and uncomplicated bike. The current trend toward downsizing, i.e., switching from heavy motorcycles to compact and versatile machines, demonstrates the great interest in this segment. The F 450 GS offers the ideal combination of playful handling, maneuverability, riding dynamics, and high-quality equipment – ​​without compromising on quality or technical performance.”Astrid Neudecker, Product Manager BMW F 450 GS\n\nThe BMW Easy Ride Clutch (ERC) is a technical highlight and a further development of a centrifugal clutch. This system eliminates the need to manually operate the clutch lever while riding. This applies to all situations, from starting off and changing gears to demanding off-road maneuvers. BMW Motorrad is setting a new standard in this vehicle class.\n\nA range of attractive options will be added at the time of market launch: The F 450 GS can be equipped with an Akrapovic end muffler and original BMW Motorrad cross-spoke wheels on request. The result is a package that combines sporty dynamic performance, technical innovation and GS DNA perfectly.\n\nPerformance developed from scratch: A confident companion for both road and off-road riding.The completely redesigned BMW F 450 GS is a sporty adventure bike that complements the current BMW Motorrad model portfolio, with developers focusing on excellent handling characteristics, strong performance, durability, and optimum accessibility.\n\nThe design focuses on the consistent implementation of the current GS design language.

This system eliminates the need to manually operate the clutch lever while riding. This applies to all situations, from starting off and changing gears to demanding off-road maneuvers. BMW Motorrad is setting a new standard in this vehicle class.\n\nA range of attractive options will be added at the time of market launch: The F 450 GS can be equipped with an Akrapovic end muffler and original BMW Motorrad cross-spoke wheels on request. The result is a package that combines sporty dynamic performance, technical innovation and GS DNA perfectly.\n\nPerformance developed from scratch: A confident companion for both road and off-road riding.The completely redesigned BMW F 450 GS is a sporty adventure bike that complements the current BMW Motorrad model portfolio, with developers focusing on excellent handling characteristics, strong performance, durability, and optimum accessibility.\n\nThe design focuses on the consistent implementation of the current GS design language. With iconic features such as the LED headlight with \"X\" daytime riding light and the distinctive flyline, the bike's affiliation with the BMW Motorrad GS family is clear at first glance.\n\nCompletely redesigned, smooth-running and characterful two-cylinder in-line engine with 135-degree crankpin offset for dynamic riding pleasure on asphalt and off-road.At the heart of the new BMW F 450 GS is a completely newly developed two-cylinder in-line engine with fuel injection and a stainless steel exhaust system on the right-hand side. The new F 450 GS impresses with its powerful performance and pulling power, delivering a power output of 35 kW (48 hp) at 8,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 43 Nm at 6,750 rpm.Thanks to the use of high-tech materials and optimized internal friction, these performance values are achieved with exactly 420 cm³. This makes the engine one of the most compact and powerful in the A2 two-cylinder segment. It not only meets the strict EU5+ requirements but is also particularly economical, consuming just 3.8 liters per 100 km. A range of over 350 km can be achieved in conjunction with the 14-liter tank. The maintenance interval is the standard 10,000 km for BMW motorcycles.\n\nUnique on the motorcycle market, the engine features a crankshaft with crankpins offset by 135 degrees and, in conjunction with a single balance shaft, sets a technical exclamation mark: this design ensures a characterful, emotional ride while simultaneously reducing unwanted vibrations to an exceptionally low level.\n\nEasy Ride Clutch (ERC) for a significant increase in dynamics, operating comfort, and riding comfort.A technical highlight of the new BMW F 450 GS is the Easy Ride Clutch (ERC). Its core is a precision centrifugal unit in the clutch, which engages the clutch depending on engine speed.\n\nThis system is standard on the GS Trophy variant and available as an optional accessory for all other model variants. In combination with the Shift Assistant Pro, manual operation of the clutch lever is completely eliminated – from starting off and gear changes to demanding maneuvers.\n\nThe clutch lever, however, remains intact and allows the rider to intervene manually at any time if necessary – for example, to lift the front wheel over an obstacle or to improve control when descending on slippery surfaces.\n\nTechnologically, the ERC is based on an advanced centrifugal clutch. Unlike conventional systems, it remains closed during overrun. This creates natural, familiar, and predictable handling at all times – comparable to a conventional clutch. The engine brake remains fully active until just before a stop; only when the idle speed is reached does the ERC automatically open, reliably preventing the engine from stalling.\n\nThe system ensures greater dynamics, control, and comfort – whether maneuvering, in city traffic, on winding roads, or off-road.\n\nSix-speed transmission and left-mounted secondary drive.

The BMW Group and Tata Technologies, a global product engineering and digital services company, have announced that they have signed an agreement to form a JV with the aim to establish a software and IT development hub with locations in Pune, Bangalore and Chennai, India. The main development and operations activities shall be established at Bangalore and Pune. In Chennai, the focus shall be on business IT solutions. The execution of the JV agreement is subject to review and approval by the relevant authorities. Embodying the ethos of ‘Engineer in India for the World’, the JV will leverage Tata Technologies’ digital engineering expertise and talent pool in India to contribute to the BMW Group’s strategic expansion of software coding capabilities across global IT hubs and 24/7 operations. The JV will focus on strategic software development, including solutions for software defined vehicles (SDV). In automotive software, the focus will be on automated driving, infotainment and digital services. In business IT, the emphasis will be on digitalization and automation of product development, production and sales. From the inception of this JV, 100 trained and experienced TATA Technologies professionals will ensure robust and immediate contribution to software projects. The JV is likely to grow quickly to a four-digit number in the following years. Christoph Grote, Senior Vice President of Software and E/E Architecture at BMW Group said: “Our collaboration with Tata Technologies will accelerate our progress in the field of the software defined vehicle. In international comparison, India boasts a large number of talents with outstanding software skills, who can contribute to our software competence. Developing vehicle software for the BMW Group means working with top-class processes and tools, which in turn gives Indian software engineers the chance to shape state-of-the-art, premium automotive experiences in future fields such as highly automated driving and artificial intelligence.” “The expansion of international DevOps* hubs has clearly proved to be a successful model for the BMW Group,” said Alexander Buresch, CIO and Senior Vice President of BMW Group IT. “I am therefore extremely pleased that we have found a strong and valued technology partner with Tata Technologies and are now also expanding our footprint in India.” Commenting on the collaboration, Warren Harris, CEO and MD of Tata Technologies, said, “Our collaboration with the BMW Group demonstrates our commitment to providing top-tier solutions in automotive software and digital engineering to customers across the world. Aligned with our vision of engineering a better world, we’re excited to bring our expertise to the forefront, aiding BMW Group in engineering premium products, delivering great digital experiences for their customers and propelling its digital transformation journey in Business IT.” Nachiket Paranjpe, President of Automotive Sales at Tata Technologies, commented, \"In the evolving automotive landscape, the journey towards software-defined vehicle represents a pivotal shift in automotive software and vehicle development methodologies. We will leverage our deep domain knowledge and SDV expertise to collaborate with the BMW Group towards engineering vehicles that are not just technologically advanced but deliver exceptional experiences to consumers around the globe.\" This collaboration between Tata Technologies and BMW Group represents a shared vision of innovation and excellence in automotive engineering and digital solutions.\n\n------------------------ End of joint press release -------------------------- Consistent, demand-oriented expansion of worldwide software expertise.\n\nThanks to the global distribution of the BMW Group's software hubs, software is developed and integrated in real time in the cloud around the clock. The global development team for vehicle software is already creating up to 140,000 software builds per day across the entire ECU software (1 build = 1 source code change/creation that can be executed in the vehicle software, including automated testing). The BMW Group started its own automotive software development over 20 years ago. Since then, it has continuously expanded its global network of development teams for both automotive software and business IT solutions. For several years now, IT- & Software Hubs in Germany, the US, South Africa, India, Portugal (Joint Venture Critical TechWorks) and China (LingYue Digital IT Co.

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection, the BMW Art Car World Tour is taking place on all five continents with numerous accompanying activities and kicks off in Europe and Asia. The official start of the world tour was celebrated yesterday as part of the “(R) EVOLUTION OF ART” event at the BMW Group Niederlassung Wien. A total of five BMW Art Cars will be shown in Vienna at the Museum of Applied Arts and at the SPARK Art Fair from March 20-23: the cars by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Jeff Koons. The latest and 20th BMW Art Car – the BMW M Hybrid V8 by renowned American painter Julie Mehretu – will embark on an Asian tour and be displayed at Art Basel in Hong Kong on March 28-30.\n\n“We are honored to be able to host the start of the BMW Art Car World Tour in Vienna,” says Dr. Josef Reiter, Managing Director of BMW Group Niederlassung Wien. “As the BMW Group in Austria, we see it as our responsibility to promote art and culture. The (R) EVOLUTION OF ART event is part of our commitment to provide creative impulses and inspire dialogue between artists, their works of art and audiences. We believe that innovation and creativity are inextricably linked — just as in the development of our cars. Art appeals to emotions — just like a BMW. The moment in which a vehicle triggers enthusiasm, wonder or wonder is comparable to experiencing an impressive work of art. Designers and engineers are working to create not only functionality, but also an emotional bond — whether through iconic shapes, an unmistakable driving experience or the combination of technology and aesthetics,” says Reiter.\n\nDesign accelerates change: The BMW Vision Neue Klasse X and BMW Vision Neue Klasse together in Vienna for the first time.As part of the event, an insight into the Neue Klasse vision vehicles was also given. With the Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is making the mobility of the future a reality as early as this year. Vehicle dynamics, drive, battery technology, operating concept, digitization: Each of these aspects has been significantly further developed and, as with design, has sometimes skipped over a generation.\n\nWith the BMW Vision Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is giving a glimpse of what the next generation of vehicles from the core BMW brand will look like. The vision vehicle shows the BMW brand's new design language, which will be reflected in many other models from the brand. The new design language is clear, elegant and timeless. The new, all-electric vehicle architecture offers new interior design options.\n\nIn the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X, the aesthetics, technology and philosophy of the Neue Klasse are transferred to the sports activity vehicle sector. The vision vehicle offers a glimpse of the BMW iX3, which will go into series production at the Debrecen plant (Hungary) in 2025.\n\nBorn from passion: a brief history of the BMW Art Car Collection.On 14 June 1975, the BMW 3.0 CSL designed by American sculptor Alexander Calder took to the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The project was initially intended as a one-time collaboration between the artist and BMW. The audience cheered for the colourful racing car and children rejoiced. BMW decided this had to continue! It all began with the passion for art and motorsport of French auctioneer and racing driver Hervé Poulain. In 1975, Poulain found a visionary ally in Jochen Neerpasch, founder and Head of BMW Motorsport, for his plan to enter a BMW designed by an artist in the legendary Le Mans endurance race. Even though the first BMW Art Car retired from the race after seven hours, it became a true crowd favourite, laying the foundations for the collection.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement.With over 100 projects worldwide, the BMW Group's international cultural funding has been an essential part of corporate communication for almost 50 years. The BMW Group's long-term commitment focuses on contemporary art, music and film, and design.\n\nIn addition to its own formats, such as the BMW Art Cars, and the “Opera for All” concerts, the company supports leading museums and art fairs as well as orchestras and opera houses around the world. BMW Group's commitment to culture is always based on mutual curiosity and appreciation. Despite all its cultural commitments, the company takes absolute freedom of creative potential for granted — because it guarantees groundbreaking works in art just as much as it is for innovations in a commercial enterprise.

On behalf of the BMW Group, I would like to congratulate our champion Jan-Lennard Struff on an outstanding performance, his first title at the BMW Open, and winning the all-electric BMW i5 M60. I am sure that he you will have a lot of fun with this innovative 5 Series. Game, set, match, joy. We now look forward to shaping the future of the BMW Open in the ATP 500 category, along with our long-term partners.”\n\nThe BMW Open also enjoyed a first in the grandstands this year. For the first time, all nine days of the iconic tournament at MTTC Iphitos in Munich were sold out. Over the course of the week, a record crowd of more than 50,000 visitors defied the unsettled weather, created the unique atmosphere at the BMW Open and enjoyed also world-class tennis from a top-drawer field: among those with their sights set on winning the title at Aumeisterweg were Olympic gold medalist Alexander Zverev (GER), last year’s winner Holger Rune (NOR), former US Open champion Dominic Thiem (AUT) and Félix Auger-Aliassime (CAN).\n\nIn the end, Struff, who had already reached the final of the BMW Open in 2021 (losing 4-6, 6-7 to Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili), deservedly triumphed. Fritz couldn't withstand the pressure of the German's powerful game throughout the final. Similar was the fate of Rune in the semifinal against Struff. The world number twelve, who had won the BMW Open twice in a row and had not lost a match in Munich until then, had to accept defeat with a score of 2-6, 0-6.\n\n“I'm thrilled that I finally made it, and it means a lot to me that I've won my first title in Germany. I can hardly wait for the next BMW Open, it's an incredible tournament,” said Struff, who received the trophy from Markus Söder, Minister President of Bavaria. The Winner’s Car BMW i5 M60 was presented from Bernhard Kuhnt on the Center Court. “That's a fantastic car,” said the visibly impressed champion. “I'm just happy.”\n\nThe champion can look forward to a powerful motor and sporty driving dynamics. The BMW i5 M60 offers the performance typical of a BMW M car – but in all-electric form. The new 5 Series saloon also underlines its sophisticated character with innovative digital services, including for in-car gaming, audio and video streaming, and particularly high-quality driver assistance systems.\n\nTournament Director Patrik Hühnen had checked out and collected the Winner’s Car himself at the production site – the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing – on behalf of the 2024 BMW Open champion.\n\nLike the Winner’s Car, the shuttle fleet, which BMW operated during the tournament, was also all-electric.

BMW M Motorsport impressively stamped its mark on the climax of the virtual ESL R1 season. At the Esports World Cup (EWC) in Riyadh (KSA), all titles went to BMW M Team Redline. On Thursday, Kevin Siggy (SLO) triumphed in the drivers' championship, and on Sunday, the newly crowned champion, along with his teammates Sebastian Job, Luke Bennett (both GBR), and Jeffrey Rietveld (NED), also secured first place in the team championship. While Siggy was rewarded with a prize of 25,000 euros, BMW M Team Redline received 140,000 euros for the overall victory. In total, the participants at the Esports World Cup competed for 500,000 euros.\n\nIn the drivers' championship, BMW M drivers dominated the event. Behind Siggy, Job and Bennett finished second and fourth, respectively, with BMW M Team MOUZ driver Maximilian Benecke (GER), last year's season highlight winner, placing third. BMW M Team BS+COMPETITION also brought a driver into the top-ten with Caique Oliveira (BRA) finishing tenth. Eight out of nine race victories went to BMW M drivers.\n\nIn the team competition, the three BMW M representatives, with their virtual BMW M4 GT3s on the “Rennsport” simulation platform, also performed strongly, finishing the group stage in first (Redline), sixth (BS+COMPETITION), and ninth (MOUZ) places. On Saturday, in the “Second Chance” event, BMW M Team MOUZ secured its ticket to the final of the top six teams thanks to a solid team performance and three victories by Benecke. On Sunday, BMW M Team Redline took the reins again and celebrated three more individual victories. With 300 points, the quartet was unbeatable after the fifth race. The decisive victory was clinched by Job. BMW M Team MOUZ finished third in the final.\n\nThe three BMW M teams had prepared together for the Esports World Cup and were supported in various ways by BMW M Motorsport. Central to this was a joint training week at Formula Medicine in Viareggio (ITA), where the twelve drivers underwent a similar programme to the BMW M works drivers from real motorsport.\n\nComments on the Esports World Cup:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to BMW M Team Redline and the new champion Kevin Siggy on this impressive triumph at the Esports World Cup. The Redline quartet once again showed outstanding performance throughout the week and racked up victory after victory – that's how you win titles. BMW M Teams MOUZ and BS+COMPETITION also showed very good form and celebrated numerous further victories and podium finishes. This shows that our preparation programme was more than worthwhile. We have transferred training methods from the real BMW M Motorsport programme into the virtual world more intensively than ever before for the Esports World Cup. It has paid off. Virtual motorsport has played an important role for us for many years. And it's fantastic that our teams could reward themselves for their hard work at the Esports World Cup.”\n\nKevin Siggy (Driver BMW M Team Redline): “We were a real powerhouse as a team. We invested a lot of work in preparation, and it paid off. We dominated the event.”\n\nLuke Bennett (Driver BMW M Team Redline): “The week went even better than we had hoped. We were confident and knew we were extremely strong but we did not expect such dominance.”\n\nSebastian Job (Driver BMW M Team Redline): “This team title means an incredible amount. I am very proud of our team. We came here as one of the favourites and had a lot of pressure on our shoulders. The way we dealt with it was great. I am very happy for the entire Team Redline, BMW M Motorsport, and also the other BMW M Teams that have also gave very strong performances here.”\n\nJeffrey Rietveld (Driver BMW M Team Redline): “This success feels fantastic. We made no mistakes and were always there when it mattered – especially in the qualifyings. This is the result of our excellent preparation, including the training camp at Formula Medicine, which really helped us mentally in dealing with the pressure.”\n\nMaximilian Benecke (Driver BMW M Team MOUZ): “This week has gone very well for me personally. If someone had offered me third place in both the drivers' and team standings beforehand, I would have gladly accepted. Now it has happened, and I am very happy. Especially with my qualifying performances, as I managed to get pole position in many races. As for our team performance, third place was the maximum we could achieve. Overall, I think all three BMW M teams have given an outstanding performance. We managed to get two teams on the podium in the team standings and occupied the top four places in the drivers' standings. This underlines the incredibly high level at which we have performed here.”\n\nCaique Oliveira (Driver BMW M Team BS+COMPETITION): “I am proud of our team's performance here at the Esports World Cup. Personally, I am very satisfied with my first victory at a LAN event as well as additional podium finishes. This is a great motivation for future events with BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team BS+COMPETITION.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport impressively stamped its mark on the climax of the virtual ESL R1 season.

About five weeks before the season opener at Australian Phillip Island, BMW Motorrad Motorsport presented the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) line-up to the public in Berlin (GER) on Wednesday. The two teams, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, as well as the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), Michael van der Mark (NED), Scott Redding (GBR), and Garrett Gerloff (USA), unveiled their BMW M 1000 RR superbikes for the WorldSBK 2024 for the first time. The event took place at a special location, in the new BMW Motorrad Welt at the BMW Motorrad Plant Berlin. This plant is the heart of the BMW Motorrad production and the birthplace of the BMW M 1000 RR.\n\nOn Tuesday, Razgatlioglu, van der Mark, Redding, and Gerloff were guests at the BMW Motorrad Plant, and during an exclusive autograph session, the employees had the opportunity to personally meet their racing colleagues from the BMW Motorrad family. On Wednesday, the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders gained closer insights into the production of the bikes, including their racing machines, during a tour of the plant.\n\nThe actual team presentation took place afterwards in BMW Motorrad World, the new “Home of the Brand” in Berlin, opened in autumn 2023. The official start of the 2024 WorldSBK occurred with the unveiling of the BMW M 1000 RR superbikes, which Razgatlioglu, van der Mark, Redding, and Gerloff will ride in the upcoming season with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team.\n\nA special feature of the team presentation in Berlin was that in addition to invited guests, fans also had the opportunity to witness the event live on-site. Many of them seized the opportunity, secured the coveted free tickets for the event, and could personally interact with the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders during the subsequent autograph session.\n\nIn preparation for the 2024 season, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the two teams, and the riders will be back on the track soon. The next test sessions will take place at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, on January 24th and 25th. The first race weekend of the season is scheduled from February 23rd to 25th at Phillip Island (AUS).\n\nQuotes after the Team Presentation in Berlin.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “First of all, I would like to thank everyone involved in the organisation. It was an absolutely cool event here at BMW Motorrad Welt. It was very nice to show the team managers and riders what we do here in Berlin. We haven’t done this in this form before. The atmosphere among all involved was fantastic, and that is also extremely important for performance because we have this one team mentality. The presentation itself in BMW Motorrad Welt was also very successful. I am confident for the new season. We still need a few tests; last year, we didn’t necessarily have the best conditions but we have prepared a lot of things. Now there is not much time left until Phillip Island. Although the first two events take place on tracks that haven’t necessarily been our strong suit in the past, I am still optimistic that we will have a good start, carry this positive energy into the first races and through the entire season.”\n\nShaun Muir (Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “First of all it is an outstanding venue for such a presentation. It think it really captures the spirit of what BMW Motorrad are trying to achieve here so I am super proud to be part of that. The tour around the plant was sensational. A big round of applause to all the guys, everyone in the factory; they really welcomed us. Moving on to the championship as such, I think it is absolutely clear that the combination of Michael and Toprak brings some special qualities. I think that is something we are really looking forward to working with. Already we can see what Toprak requires in terms of a package and a bike. It is a little bit different, not an awful lot, we just need to steer in a slightly different direction to give Toprak what he needs. And I say that in terms of letting him amplify his strengths which is hard on the brakes, corner entry, balance on the bike, something we know the BMW M 1000 RR can work well with. We want to put ourselves in a strong position, we want to compete for the podium in Australia. Can we get a podium? It's a tough question, but Toprak’s personal aims are that he thinks he can and we give him all the support to do that. Michael has missed large parts of the past two seasons, and he does not underestimate what he is up against but he is definitely up for that challenge. I feel that Toprak can bring a lot of strengths out of Michael. I am looking forward to seeing that because we saw how good Michael can be when things go well. The bike is getting better, there is a development team behind us. From where the project started in 2019 to where we are now is night and day. I hope we can take advantage of that and get our rewards.”\n\nMichael Galinski (Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “The team presentation was truly impressive. Many people attended, and it was very interesting at the BMW Motorrad plant and in the BMW Motorrad Welt. It was my first time at the plant itself, and it was fascinating to see the engine department and how all the motorcycles are assembled. It was great to take a behind-the-scenes look and also to present ourselves here as a team. We are very happy with our rider duo. They are two real top riders. Scott is the Vice World Champion, Garrett had a very strong second half of the season last year. Our goal is to move further forward, and with the BMW Motorrad family, this is certainly possible this season. So much manpower has been added that we are really happy now. Of course, we still need a bit of time, but we are confident that we will move forward this year.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff (#31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “It has been exciting. There has been a really cool energy here at Berlin. It’s great to be in Berlin, it’s really nice to see all the amazing people that work here in the plant, that develop and produce the BMW M 1000 RR that we race. So it’s really cool to have the team presentation here. It has been really nice to see Scott, Toprak and Michael and to get together after a couple of months of holidays and seeing family and friends. I can tell that we are all excited to get back on the track and to start testing again. In just over a month we are going to be racing in Australia. Everything is going to happen really fast from here on but I’ve been doing my part to make sure that I am ready for the season and I am excited to get started. I think we have a really good base now. I have one year behind me with BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, so a lot of information and I think we can come up with solutions faster than last year if we do have a problem. It is going to be good to go the every track with a higher potential, and I think it can be a really good season. My goal is to work on qualifying and to be a bit better there and that can help me in the beginning of the races and then at the end of the races, when I am strong, I think we can make some real progress and be up front.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#54 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “I am very happy to join the BMW Motorrad family. When I arrived at Berlin on Monday and left the airport I was really surprised because everyone spoke Turkish. Also at the plant, there a so many Turkish employees. I am very happy for this. In general, I am very positive. Especially today, there were a lot of people and I understand that a lot of people like me. A lot of people came here to see me, also many Turkish guys, and a lot of them came from very far away. Everyone can’t wait for the season, and that also goes for me. My focus is now on the season. I realized that the people believe in me, but it is important that you believe in your bike. Many people say that the BMW is not ready to fight for the championship but I believe that my bike is ready to fight for wins and the championship. We just need my setup, because my riding style is complete different. When we have this, we can easily fight for the win. Now I am just focusing on the test next week. It is really important for me. I need to adapt to the bike and I believe that we can fight for the podium and the wins this season. I am excited. I signed with BMW but I am also a part of the family. This is something I saw today again and it is great. I will give more than 100 percent, I will try to win with BMW. Everyone is working hard and this is a great extra motivation also for me. If we keep doing this, we will win the World Championship.”\n\nScott Redding (#45 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “It’s good to come here to Berlin. To come into the plant and to see how everything is made is always interesting, seeing the people in action at their work is always good. It’s also very interesting to see where the engines are built and how they do it, so it’s really nice to be here and to witness how everything is made. A launch is also always great, to unveil the colours of the bikes and the suites, together with the team-mates and the teams. Speaking about the coming season, for me it would be nice to have our bike to be more consistently competitive which I think we can do. We’ve had some good changes made and obviously Toprak is coming over. We also have a test team which makes a big difference. I think we are going in the right direction, which is important. It would be nice to stand on the podium again this year and more frequently, and to try to make our bad weekends not so bad and have a good, consistent year.”\n\nMichael van der Mark (#60 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It’s nice to start the season, it’s great to be here in Berlin. We all know that BMW is a big company but we got a nice tour through the plant and I must say that it is really impressive. It was also great to see where they prepare the race engines and I am really ready to start the season. I can’t wait to go testing again, I feel one hundred percent fit, I got a new teammate that seems to be really fast – so I am looking forward to it. Like I said, I am fit again, the bike is getting better and better, Toprak is pushing the project even more and I think we want to win races and be on the podium as soon as possible.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "About five weeks before the season opener, BMW Motorrad Motorsport presented the 2024 WorldSBK line-up to the public in Berlin.

It was an absolutely cool event here at BMW Motorrad Welt. It was very nice to show the team managers and riders what we do here in Berlin. We haven’t done this in this form before. The atmosphere among all involved was fantastic, and that is also extremely important for performance because we have this one team mentality. The presentation itself in BMW Motorrad Welt was also very successful. I am confident for the new season. We still need a few tests; last year, we didn’t necessarily have the best conditions but we have prepared a lot of things. Now there is not much time left until Phillip Island. Although the first two events take place on tracks that haven’t necessarily been our strong suit in the past, I am still optimistic that we will have a good start, carry this positive energy into the first races and through the entire season.”\n\nShaun Muir (Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “First of all it is an outstanding venue for such a presentation. It think it really captures the spirit of what BMW Motorrad are trying to achieve here so I am super proud to be part of that. The tour around the plant was sensational. A big round of applause to all the guys, everyone in the factory; they really welcomed us. Moving on to the championship as such, I think it is absolutely clear that the combination of Michael and Toprak brings some special qualities. I think that is something we are really looking forward to working with. Already we can see what Toprak requires in terms of a package and a bike. It is a little bit different, not an awful lot, we just need to steer in a slightly different direction to give Toprak what he needs. And I say that in terms of letting him amplify his strengths which is hard on the brakes, corner entry, balance on the bike, something we know the BMW M 1000 RR can work well with. We want to put ourselves in a strong position, we want to compete for the podium in Australia. Can we get a podium? It's a tough question, but Toprak’s personal aims are that he thinks he can and we give him all the support to do that. Michael has missed large parts of the past two seasons, and he does not underestimate what he is up against but he is definitely up for that challenge. I feel that Toprak can bring a lot of strengths out of Michael. I am looking forward to seeing that because we saw how good Michael can be when things go well. The bike is getting better, there is a development team behind us. From where the project started in 2019 to where we are now is night and day. I hope we can take advantage of that and get our rewards.”\n\nMichael Galinski (Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “The team presentation was truly impressive. Many people attended, and it was very interesting at the BMW Motorrad plant and in the BMW Motorrad Welt. It was my first time at the plant itself, and it was fascinating to see the engine department and how all the motorcycles are assembled. It was great to take a behind-the-scenes look and also to present ourselves here as a team. We are very happy with our rider duo. They are two real top riders. Scott is the Vice World Champion, Garrett had a very strong second half of the season last year. Our goal is to move further forward, and with the BMW Motorrad family, this is certainly possible this season. So much manpower has been added that we are really happy now. Of course, we still need a bit of time, but we are confident that we will move forward this year.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff (#31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “It has been exciting. There has been a really cool energy here at Berlin. It’s great to be in Berlin, it’s really nice to see all the amazing people that work here in the plant, that develop and produce the BMW M 1000 RR that we race. So it’s really cool to have the team presentation here. It has been really nice to see Scott, Toprak and Michael and to get together after a couple of months of holidays and seeing family and friends. I can tell that we are all excited to get back on the track and to start testing again. In just over a month we are going to be racing in Australia. Everything is going to happen really fast from here on but I’ve been doing my part to make sure that I am ready for the season and I am excited to get started. I think we have a really good base now. I have one year behind me with BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, so a lot of information and I think we can come up with solutions faster than last year if we do have a problem. It is going to be good to go the every track with a higher potential, and I think it can be a really good season. My goal is to work on qualifying and to be a bit better there and that can help me in the beginning of the races and then at the end of the races, when I am strong, I think we can make some real progress and be up front.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#54 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “I am very happy to join the BMW Motorrad family. When I arrived at Berlin on Monday and left the airport I was really surprised because everyone spoke Turkish. Also at the plant, there a so many Turkish employees. I am very happy for this. In general, I am very positive. Especially today, there were a lot of people and I understand that a lot of people like me. A lot of people came here to see me, also many Turkish guys, and a lot of them came from very far away. Everyone can’t wait for the season, and that also goes for me. My focus is now on the season. I realized that the people believe in me, but it is important that you believe in your bike. Many people say that the BMW is not ready to fight for the championship but I believe that my bike is ready to fight for wins and the championship. We just need my setup, because my riding style is complete different. When we have this, we can easily fight for the win. Now I am just focusing on the test next week. It is really important for me. I need to adapt to the bike and I believe that we can fight for the podium and the wins this season. I am excited. I signed with BMW but I am also a part of the family. This is something I saw today again and it is great. I will give more than 100 percent, I will try to win with BMW. Everyone is working hard and this is a great extra motivation also for me. If we keep doing this, we will win the World Championship.”\n\nScott Redding (#45 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “It’s good to come here to Berlin. To come into the plant and to see how everything is made is always interesting, seeing the people in action at their work is always good. It’s also very interesting to see where the engines are built and how they do it, so it’s really nice to be here and to witness how everything is made. A launch is also always great, to unveil the colours of the bikes and the suites, together with the team-mates and the teams. Speaking about the coming season, for me it would be nice to have our bike to be more consistently competitive which I think we can do. We’ve had some good changes made and obviously Toprak is coming over. We also have a test team which makes a big difference. I think we are going in the right direction, which is important. It would be nice to stand on the podium again this year and more frequently, and to try to make our bad weekends not so bad and have a good, consistent year.”\n\nMichael van der Mark (#60 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It’s nice to start the season, it’s great to be here in Berlin. We all know that BMW is a big company but we got a nice tour through the plant and I must say that it is really impressive. It was also great to see where they prepare the race engines and I am really ready to start the season. I can’t wait to go testing again, I feel one hundred percent fit, I got a new teammate that seems to be really fast – so I am looking forward to it. Like I said, I am fit again, the bike is getting better and better, Toprak is pushing the project even more and I think we want to win races and be on the podium as soon as possible.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW Motorrad Motorsport Team Presentation: The 2024 WorldSBK kickoff takes place in the BMW Motorrad Welt in Berlin."}]}

As BMW Group Plant Leipzig celebrates its 20th anniversary, a stream of high-ranking representatives from politics, business and civil society today came to the plant to offer their congratulations on its two-decade success story. Among them were Barbara Meyer, Secretary of State for the Free State of Saxony, and the Lord Mayor of Leipzig Burkhard Jung. Both highlighted the plant’s importance for the economic development of the Leipzig/Halle region, but also for Saxony more generally. Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production, emphasised Leipzig’s pioneering spirit and extreme flexibility as factors in its success.\n\nSince 2005 Plant Leipzig has produced almost 4,000,000 vehicles and received over €5.6 billion so far in investment from the BMW Group, creating 6,680 jobs with BMW. More than 11,600 people in total currently work at the site, which has undergone constant improvement over the years to enhance efficiency, flexibility and innovation, and prepare for the future. Today Leipzig is the only BMW Group plant to produce BMW and MINI vehicles side by side on the same production line – to customer specification and with the full range of drive options, from combustion engine to hybrid or electric drive.\n\nCapacity utilisation is currently high at Plant Leipzig, with round-the-clock production in three shifts. This year the plant is expecting to achieve a new production record, its last being in 2024, when output totalled 246,195 vehicles. In 2025 Plant Leipzig will once again be a key contributor to the over 1,000,000 vehicles made at BMW Group plants in Germany.

Because of its flexibility and efficiency, it is a key cornerstone in what we do, as we believe in Germany’s strength within our global production network.”\n\nAlongside flexibility and efficiency, Plant Director Petra Peterhänsel emphasised another key factor in Leipzig’s success: its capacity for innovation. “Here in Leipzig, we have paved the way for many innovations. One was the first electric BMW – the BMW i3. Another is the use of hydrogen, which we are already applying in intralogistics and will soon utilise in the paint shop too.” Looking ahead, Peterhänsel commented: “We are currently investing hundreds of millions in extending and modernising our systems and structures to prepare our plant for forthcoming vehicle generations. This will set the course for our future and keep Leipzig competitive.”\n\nSaxony’s Minister President Michael Kretschmer emphazises: “BMW in Leipzig has completely reshaped our economic history. BMW has always been focused on technical progress and people’s real needs, on the cars they truly want to drive. If it continues on this path, it will remain at the forefront in the future as well.”\n\nLord Mayor Burkhard Jung highlighted the plant’s importance for the city of Leipzig: “We are very pleased indeed that the largest industrial employer in our city is looking back on 20 years of success. while also looking forward to a bright future.

Achieving success is a real challenge in such a huge and top-quality field as this – with 55 cars from eight manufacturers already set to contest the opening round of the Endurance Cup at Monza. We are well prepared with our BMW M4 GT3 and, with six BMW M works drivers, also have a lot of quality in the cockpit. On the one hand we have three very experienced and top drivers in the #98 BMW M4 GT3, who have already enjoyed a lot of success. On the other hand, in the #998 car, we have three young guns who did well as juniors last year and have developed superbly. Monza is a unique track, which really puts both man and machine to the test. The brakes and engine power are very important.

In December 1922, BMW chief designer Max Friz puts the first full-scale BMW motorcycle on the drawing board. At its heart is an air-cooled two-cylinder four-stroke boxer engine. The first BMW motorcycle, the R 32, was presented in September 1923. This heralded the beginning of BMW motorcycle production and launched an unprecedented success story. To celebrate its 100-year history, BMW Motorrad is now presenting the two protagonists of the Heritage experience world - the R nineT Roadster and the R 18 Cruiser with big boxer - as 100 Years edition models. In keeping with the year in which BMW Motorrad was founded, both models are limited to 1923 units each.\n\nThe reduced design language of the R nineT is shaped by 100 years of motorcycle construction and BMW Motorrad's unbroken passion for the boxer engine. Classic roadster design skilfully sets the scene with a compact tank and upright seating position as well as high-quality materials and stylish design elements. The new R nineT 100 Years becomes an exclusive anniversary edition thanks to numerous other special features. The heart is still the air/oil-cooled, 80 kW (109 hp) two-cylinder boxer engine. In the anniversary edition the legendary engine is accompanied by a wide range of options and an elaborate surface concept.\n\nPaint finishes in combination with chrome surfaces also have an almost 100-year tradition in motorcycle construction. Chrome surfaces, usually consisting of a copper, nickel and final chrome layer are characterised by their hardness and resulting high durability, very good protection against corrosion, but above all by a radiant, mirror-like shine. This made chrome a common stylistic device for designers from the late 1920s onwards, in combination with high-quality paint concepts. The BMW R 75/5 with chrome-plated tank sides and side covers, for example, is legendary at BMW Motorrad. With the new BMW R nineT 100 Years and R 18 100 Years and the Classic Chrome surface concept, BMW Motorrad is reviving this incomparably sophisticated interplay of paint and chrome. The tank is a combination of black with chrome and white double-lining and is complemented by knee pads and a 100 Years badge. Classic chrome is also found on the seat hump. The front wheel cover is also painted in black and features white double lining. The seat bench in two-tone combination black/oxblood rounds off the high quality look. Numerous black components such as fork tubes, air intake snorkel and some Option 719 components complement this harmoniously. The R nineT 100 Years includes the 719 Classic wheels option with black anodised rim rings, the Option 719 Shadow milled parts package with milled cylinder head covers, engine housing covers, seat holders, oil filler plug and the Option 719 Shadow II milled parts package, consisting of adjustable hand levers and a footrest system, pillion footrests as well as expansion tank covers and handlebar end mirrors. Adaptive turning light and the Comfort Package with heated grips, cruise control and Driving Modes Pro complete the extensive equipment of the edition model. An anti-theft alarm system can also be retrofitted as part of the optional equipment ex works or via the range of Original BMW Motorrad Accessories.\n\nThe unmissable centrepiece of the R 18 100 Years is the 67 kW (91 hp) boxer engine with the largest displacement ever installed by BMW Motorrad. Both technically and visually, the BMW R 18 borrows from famous BMW models such as the BMW R 5 and puts the focus back on the essentials of motorcycling: Purist, no-frills technology and the boxer engine as the epicentre of riding pleasure. The big boxer is also complemented by numerous special features as well as a high-grade surface concept in the anniversary edition of the R 18. The colour scheme of the R 18 100 Years, like that of the anniversary model of the R nineT, is in Classic Chrome and thus combines black paintwork and high-gloss chrome surfaces as well as white double lining and a 100 Years badge. The paint-on-chrome concept in Classic Chrome is also found on the rear wheel cover in combination with white double lining. The front wheel cover and the side covers are painted in black, complemented by white double lining on the front mudguard. The Option 719 seat upholstered in the bicolour combination black/oxblood with high-quality diamond embossing blends in harmoniously. Black as a symbolic colour scheme of great BMW Motorrad tradition also adorns the engine, transmission housing and rear axle drive. The exact designation is Avus Black - a reminiscence of the legendary high-speed race track in Berlin, where BMW Motorrad once celebrated great racing successes and where the Avus monument with BMW Motorrad factory rider Ernst Henne still commemorates it today. Berlin is also home to the BMW Motorrad production plant. The plant located in Berlin-Spandau is not only a production site, it is also the lead plant for the international motorcycle production of BMW Motorrad. The R 18 100 Years is complemented by numerous chrome parts from the Chrome design option. The high-quality and durable galvanic surface coating can be found on these parts: Handlebar fittings, gearshift and foot brake levers, handlebar clamps, handlebar weights, mirrors, brake master cylinders, brake calipers, engine casing covers, cylinder head covers and intake manifold trims. Other features of the BMW R 18 100 Years also include chromed Akrapovič rear silencers with perforated tailpipe trims in the \"propeller style\" of the BMW brand logo. Safety and comfort are ensured by Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light, reversing aid, electronic cruise control and heated grips. As part of the optional equipment ex works, the new BMW R 18 100 Years can also be equipped with anti-theft alarm system, pillion package, running boards, Hill Start Control, lockable fuel filler cap and power reduction. With the R nineT and R 18 models in the Heritage experience world, BMW Motorrad is paying due tribute to its almost 100-year history and tradition, which is inextricably linked with the legendary boxer engine. Tradition and history can also be found at the BMW Motorrad production plant in Berlin - the birthplace of almost every BMW motorcycle for over 50 years. The iconic design and the unmistakable boxer engine illustrate that it's about the roots of BMW Motorrad, about historically inspired shapes and details, about an authentic riding experience and about reducing motorbikes to the essentials. In short: The Heritage world of experience is all about a unique attitude to life, shaped by the legendary boxer engine.\n\nYou will find press material on BMW motorcycles in the BMW Group PressClub at \n\nIn case of queries please contact:\n\nDominik Schaidnagel, Spokesperson BMW Motorrad\n\nTim Diehl-Thiele, Head of Communications BMW Motorrad\n\nJens Lemon, Head of Communications MINI and BMW Motorrad\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2021, the BMW Group sold over 2.5 million passenger vehicles and more than 194,000 motorcycles worldwide.

At BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the countdown to the start of the 2024 season in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) is underway. With the two-day Pre-Test at Le Mans (FRA) this week, the final phase of preparations for the season opener has begun. It will take place from 18th to 21st April at the same venue, featuring the racing classic 24 Heures Motos. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, which will compete in 2024 with Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and new addition Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), worked on fine-tuning the #37 BMW M 1000 RR for the 2024 season during the test.\n\nWhile the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Guintoli competes in the highest class, Formula EWC, for overall victories and the title, the Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team enters its second full season in the FIM EWC’s Superstock class. Like last year, Kenny Foray (FRA), Jan Bühn (GER), and Loïc Arbel (FRA) will alternate on the #9 BMW M 1000 RR. Also present at the test at Le Mans was BMW’s new addition Hannes Soomer. The 26-year-old Estonian will support both teams as the fourth rider in the upcoming season.\n\nAdditionally, two more BMW teams from the Superstock class prepared for the season opener at the test. The Japanese Team Etoile is using the #25 BMW M 1000 RR and Team T2C Racing from France is competing with the starting number 2.\n\nReactions to the Pre-Test at Le Mans.\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “In the end, I think we can be very happy with the test. We know what to do for race week. For sure, not everything was perfect but it looks like we have found a good way. All three riders did a very good job so I think we are well prepared for the race in two weeks’ time and I have a good feeling.”\n\nSylvain Guintoli: “It was a positive test. We got a lot of work done and had all the conditions that we could get. We had rain and then dry and then rain again, so we did a lot of testing in the wet as well which was good. The pace was good in wet and dry for everybody so it’s looking good and we managed to find some interesting solutions for the setup which was the idea of these two days. We’re happy with the progress and now I’m very much looking forward to the race in two weeks’ time. Hopefully we can fight for the win; that’s the objective.”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik: “The test was quite tricky with the weather conditions but in the wet, we did not have a bad feeling and then in the end we had a few hours in dry conditions. That also went pretty well but we still have some work to do for the race weekend to further improve the bike. That will be our focus in the next two weeks. We are ready to fight again and will try to bring our bike to the top.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger: “We finished the test in third place, and all three of us were within four-tenths of a second. Unfortunately, I encountered some traffic on my fast lap and couldn’t quite show my best but we are quite satisfied.

At BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the countdown to the start of the 2024 season in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) is underway. With the two-day Pre-Test at Le Mans (FRA) this week, the final phase of preparations for the season opener has begun. It will take place from 18th to 21st April at the same venue, featuring the racing classic 24 Heures Motos. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, which will compete in 2024 with Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and new addition Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), worked on fine-tuning the #37 BMW M 1000 RR for the 2024 season during the test.\n\nWhile the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Guintoli competes in the highest class, Formula EWC, for overall victories and the title, the Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team enters its second full season in the FIM EWC’s Superstock class. Like last year, Kenny Foray (FRA), Jan Bühn (GER), and Loïc Arbel (FRA) will alternate on the #9 BMW M 1000 RR. Also present at the test at Le Mans was BMW’s new addition Hannes Soomer. The 26-year-old Estonian will support both teams as the fourth rider in the upcoming season.\n\nAdditionally, two more BMW teams from the Superstock class prepared for the season opener at the test. The Japanese Team Etoile is using the #25 BMW M 1000 RR and Team T2C Racing from France is competing with the starting number 2.\n\nReactions to the Pre-Test at Le Mans.\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “In the end, I think we can be very happy with the test. We know what to do for race week. For sure, not everything was perfect but it looks like we have found a good way. All three riders did a very good job so I think we are well prepared for the race in two weeks’ time and I have a good feeling.”\n\nSylvain Guintoli: “It was a positive test. We got a lot of work done and had all the conditions that we could get. We had rain and then dry and then rain again, so we did a lot of testing in the wet as well which was good. The pace was good in wet and dry for everybody so it’s looking good and we managed to find some interesting solutions for the setup which was the idea of these two days. We’re happy with the progress and now I’m very much looking forward to the race in two weeks’ time. Hopefully we can fight for the win; that’s the objective.”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik: “The test was quite tricky with the weather conditions but in the wet, we did not have a bad feeling and then in the end we had a few hours in dry conditions. That also went pretty well but we still have some work to do for the race weekend to further improve the bike. That will be our focus in the next two weeks. We are ready to fight again and will try to bring our bike to the top.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger: “We finished the test in third place, and all three of us were within four-tenths of a second.

With the publication of its Environmental Impact Statement 2024, all BMW Group operations in Parsdorf are now part of the European environmental register, EMAS. In addition to the BMW Group Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) and test-parts logistics, the pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf has been included in the environmental impact statement and EMAS registration for the first time. EMAS stands for the “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme”, which claims to be the most stringent environmental management system in the world. “We are very pleased with the EMAS registration of all our operations in Parsdorf, which underlines that our processes operate at a very high level – both economically and environmentally,” says Hansjörg Schilp, director of the CMCC and pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf. “The entire team has done an outstanding job.”\n\nEMAS: Strict requirements and high environmental standards\n\nTo be listed in the EMAS Register, companies must fulfil strict requirements and adhere to rigorous environmental standards. EMAS is a globally recognised framework that enables organisations to manage and continuously improve their environmental impact. A key element of the EMAS environmental management system is the international environmental management standard ISO 14001. EMAS also focuses on measurable improvements, transparency and legal certainty. Auditing aims to support companies in continuously improving their environmental performance – for example, by using energy and material more efficiently and reducing emissions, wastewater and waste from their sites. Beyond these direct environmental impacts, EMAS also addresses and evaluates indirect aspects, including the sustainability of products, procurement and supply chains, contractor practices and the environmental impact of employees commuting to work. (Source: \n\nEfficient operations and concepts for the circular economy\n\nThe validated environmental impact statement and the resulting inclusion in the EMAS Register by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) for Munich and Upper Bavaria underscore the rigorous environmental standards upheld by the BMW Group in Parsdorf. Battery cell production at the CMCC, one of the three Parsdorf facilities, is powered entirely by electricity from 100% renewable energy sources. Hot water for process ventilation is generated using waste heat recovered from various primary processes, and all three Parsdorf facilities utilise heat pumps in their operations. “On our pilot lines for battery cells and high-voltage batteries, we are focusing on reducing the use of critical raw materials and energy, avoiding solvents and developing innovative circular economy approaches,” explains Schilp. Raw materials represent a significant cost factor for battery cells and high-voltage batteries. Efficient and responsible use of these resources is therefore necessary and also makes economic sense. The BMW Group is gaining valuable insights in this area in Parsdorf. Residual materials from the production process are collected and, wherever technically feasible, reintegrated into the value-creation cycle at the BMW Group’s Competence Centres through direct recycling. This innovative procedure enables residual materials from battery cell production, as well as whole battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled into their components.\n\nTransparent reporting: Environmental impact statement now online\n\nThe environmental impact statement for the BMW Group’s Parsdorf operations (CMCC, pilot plant for high-voltage batteries and test-parts logistics) has been independently reviewed by TÜV SÜD Umweltgutachter GmbH and is now available online at: \n\nHow the cell is created: Production steps for sample manufacturing at the CMCC\n\nCell manufacturing at the CMCC in Parsdorf begins with electrode production: Here, the base material, comprising, for example, graphite for the anode and nickel oxides for the cathode, with binders and solvents, is metered and mixed in a precisely measured ratio. This creates the so-called “slurry” – which means wafer-thin metal foils are coated and then compressed after drying. In technical jargon, this is referred to as “calendering”. The highest level of precision is required: The foil is just a few micrometres thick – in other words, thinner than the threads of a spider web – while the coating is in the micrometre range. During cell assembly, the coated foils, referred to in the jargon as calendered electrodes, are coiled into so-called “jelly rolls” using the separator and inserted into the cell housing. The cells are filled with electrolyte, then charged for the first time and finally checked for functionality and quality.\n\nParsdorf pioneers: How the BMW Group builds Gen6 high-voltage batteries\n\nParsdorf is also home to the BMW Group’s largest pilot plant for Gen6 high-voltage batteries, where production processes are developed and tested before large-scale production begins at the series plants in Debrecen (Hungary), Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). More than 350 employees have been building initial high-voltage battery prototypes here since 2023. In the meantime, these batteries have also been delivered to the vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where they were installed in test vehicles for the Neue Klasse. For series production, the BMW Group sources battery cells for its high-voltage batteries from leading cell manufacturers, who produce the cells to the company's specifications. The highest technical standards apply. Upon receipt of goods, additional measurements – such as voltage checks – are carried out. Next comes cell clustering, where the battery cells are connected to coolers. This step ensures optimal insulation and cooling of the cells. The cell clusters and cell contact system are then laser-cleaned and welded with pinpoint precision. The in-line inspection continuously monitors each weld seam in real time. An innovative foaming process follows, ensuring that all elements are protected as a mechanical unit. The foam thus guarantees the safety, stability and durability of the high-voltage battery. The housing is then closed, sealed and riveted. In the final assembly step, the Energy Master – the central control unit – is installed onto the high-voltage battery.

EMAS stands for the “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme”, which claims to be the most stringent environmental management system in the world. “We are very pleased with the EMAS registration of all our operations in Parsdorf, which underlines that our processes operate at a very high level – both economically and environmentally,” says Hansjörg Schilp, director of the CMCC and pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf. “The entire team has done an outstanding job.”\n\nEMAS: Strict requirements and high environmental standards\n\nTo be listed in the EMAS Register, companies must fulfil strict requirements and adhere to rigorous environmental standards. EMAS is a globally recognised framework that enables organisations to manage and continuously improve their environmental impact. A key element of the EMAS environmental management system is the international environmental management standard ISO 14001. EMAS also focuses on measurable improvements, transparency and legal certainty. Auditing aims to support companies in continuously improving their environmental performance – for example, by using energy and material more efficiently and reducing emissions, wastewater and waste from their sites. Beyond these direct environmental impacts, EMAS also addresses and evaluates indirect aspects, including the sustainability of products, procurement and supply chains, contractor practices and the environmental impact of employees commuting to work. (Source: \n\nEfficient operations and concepts for the circular economy\n\nThe validated environmental impact statement and the resulting inclusion in the EMAS Register by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) for Munich and Upper Bavaria underscore the rigorous environmental standards upheld by the BMW Group in Parsdorf. Battery cell production at the CMCC, one of the three Parsdorf facilities, is powered entirely by electricity from 100% renewable energy sources. Hot water for process ventilation is generated using waste heat recovered from various primary processes, and all three Parsdorf facilities utilise heat pumps in their operations. “On our pilot lines for battery cells and high-voltage batteries, we are focusing on reducing the use of critical raw materials and energy, avoiding solvents and developing innovative circular economy approaches,” explains Schilp. Raw materials represent a significant cost factor for battery cells and high-voltage batteries. Efficient and responsible use of these resources is therefore necessary and also makes economic sense. The BMW Group is gaining valuable insights in this area in Parsdorf. Residual materials from the production process are collected and, wherever technically feasible, reintegrated into the value-creation cycle at the BMW Group’s Competence Centres through direct recycling. This innovative procedure enables residual materials from battery cell production, as well as whole battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled into their components.\n\nTransparent reporting: Environmental impact statement now online\n\nThe environmental impact statement for the BMW Group’s Parsdorf operations (CMCC, pilot plant for high-voltage batteries and test-parts logistics) has been independently reviewed by TÜV SÜD Umweltgutachter GmbH and is now available online at: \n\nHow the cell is created: Production steps for sample manufacturing at the CMCC\n\nCell manufacturing at the CMCC in Parsdorf begins with electrode production: Here, the base material, comprising, for example, graphite for the anode and nickel oxides for the cathode, with binders and solvents, is metered and mixed in a precisely measured ratio. This creates the so-called “slurry” – which means wafer-thin metal foils are coated and then compressed after drying. In technical jargon, this is referred to as “calendering”. The highest level of precision is required: The foil is just a few micrometres thick – in other words, thinner than the threads of a spider web – while the coating is in the micrometre range. During cell assembly, the coated foils, referred to in the jargon as calendered electrodes, are coiled into so-called “jelly rolls” using the separator and inserted into the cell housing. The cells are filled with electrolyte, then charged for the first time and finally checked for functionality and quality.\n\nParsdorf pioneers: How the BMW Group builds Gen6 high-voltage batteries\n\nParsdorf is also home to the BMW Group’s largest pilot plant for Gen6 high-voltage batteries, where production processes are developed and tested before large-scale production begins at the series plants in Debrecen (Hungary), Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). More than 350 employees have been building initial high-voltage battery prototypes here since 2023. In the meantime, these batteries have also been delivered to the vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where they were installed in test vehicles for the Neue Klasse. For series production, the BMW Group sources battery cells for its high-voltage batteries from leading cell manufacturers, who produce the cells to the company's specifications. The highest technical standards apply. Upon receipt of goods, additional measurements – such as voltage checks – are carried out. Next comes cell clustering, where the battery cells are connected to coolers. This step ensures optimal insulation and cooling of the cells. The cell clusters and cell contact system are then laser-cleaned and welded with pinpoint precision. The in-line inspection continuously monitors each weld seam in real time. An innovative foaming process follows, ensuring that all elements are protected as a mechanical unit. The foam thus guarantees the safety, stability and durability of the high-voltage battery. The housing is then closed, sealed and riveted. In the final assembly step, the Energy Master – the central control unit – is installed onto the high-voltage battery. A permanently elastic sealing adhesive is applied to ensure a reliable seal. Finally, each high-voltage battery undergoes a 100% end-of-line inspection to ensure quality, safety and function."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The 2025 season opener of the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) will go down as one of the most dramatic 24-hour races in history. From start to finish, persistent rain during the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) created extremely treacherous conditions. In this eventful endurance marathon, the BMW teams demonstrated the potential of the BMW M 1000 RR. The private team ERC Endurance #6 celebrated a podium finish with third place. The factory team, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team (#37), was also among the top favourites and crossed the line in fourth place after 24 turbulent hours.\n\nAfter dry weather up until Friday, rain began right on schedule on race day Saturday. The track became extremely slippery, resulting in numerous crashes throughout the field. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with factory riders Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), Markus Reiterberger (GER), Steven Odendaal (GER), and reserve rider Hannes Soomer (EST) was not spared. The #37 BMW M 1000 RR led the field with a solid advantage during the chaotic early stages but over the following hours, the team – like nearly all others – suffered crashes and had to take a lengthy repair break. Nevertheless, Guintoli, Reiterberger, and Odendaal fought their way back, keeping their podium hopes alive.\n\nBMW Motorrad Motorsport was represented on the Le Mans podium by ERC Endurance #6, with riders Kenny Foray (FRA), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), and David Checa (ESP). The trio showed strong pace throughout race week with their #6 BMW M 1000 RR and rewarded themselves with third place.\n\nIn addition to these teams, four other private BMW squads competed at Le Mans. In the Superstock class, Team Étoile from Japan narrowly missed the podium, finishing fourth. On the #25 BMW M 1000 RR, riders Hikari Okubo, Kazuki Watanabe, and Motoharu Ito (all JPN) shared duties. The Hungarian Endurance Racing Team by Moto Jungle claimed the celebrated pole position in the Superstock class with the #713 BMW M 1000 RR. However, the race also proved to be eventful for this Hungarian trio – Bálint Kovács, Máté Számado, and Soma Görbe. On Sunday morning, the #713 had to head into the pits but returned to the track for the final lap, crossing the finish line to the cheers of the team. Team LRP Poland, with riders Danny Webb, Michael Dunlop (both GBR), and Enzo Boulom (FRA) on the #90 BMW M 1000 RR, was forced to retire late in the evening. The French team T2C Racing (#2 BMW S 1000 RR) also retired early in the evening.\n\nThe second race of the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship, the 8 Hours of Spa Motos at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), will take place on June 7.\n\nReactions after the 24h Le Mans:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This 24-hour race is one we’ll all remember for a long time. The challenge of riding a race like Le Mans under such conditions was immense for everyone involved. That makes the strong performance of the BMW teams and riders all the more impressive. Congratulations to the entire ERC Endurance #6 team who managed to reach the podium in their first race in this lineup. Our factory team also proved its podium potential right to the very end. Many thanks to the team and the riders for their hard work and strong performance. What we saw at Le Mans gives us a lot of confidence for the rest of the FIM EWC season.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an absolutely emotional experience all around. Le Mans is always impressive, and endurance racing is full of passion. I think that passion was evident from the first to the last lap. The riders had to take big risks in extremely difficult conditions. By hour 22, there had already been more than 145 crashes – surely a record, but a sad one. Teams put in so much work and heart, and only a few got the reward. It was a real sporting challenge, and we’re very happy to have a BMW M 1000 RR on the podium. Congratulations to Uwe Reinhardt and the ERC crew. Our Werner Daemen-led factory team fought right to the last minute. We had crashes with all three riders; it was just that tough out there. Plus, we had a follow-up repair that cost us about 15 minutes, which was likely the small margin that kept us from the podium. We were a bit unlucky, but we’re happy with the many points we’re taking home. It’s a solid foundation for the rest of the season, and we’re looking forward to Spa, Werner Daemen’s home race. I think that track suits our BMW M 1000 RR well. You could already see its potential here.”\n\nKenny Foray, ERC Endurance #6: “The feeling is just incredible. It was an absolutely crazy race. I think it is not possible to imagine how we feel on the bike when you watch so many crashes like this. And when you go to your hospitality to take some rest and you see more crashes on TV, and you know that you soon have to be back on the bike again – this was really, really difficult. We had some problems but we did not crash, we stayed on the bike, and I think that was the key of the race. It is just an incredible moment. This is the first race for the team with the BMW M 1000 RR and we start with a podium. That is fantastic!”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik, ERC Endurance #6: “It feels nice because when you change the team you also want to have good results. Despite the fact that we did not ride or test a lot this winter we showed immediately, without any track time, our performance. It was great to be so competitive during the weekend and in the end, we were on the podium. I want to say a big thank you to BMW for the support and to Uwe Reinhardt, the Team Principal. It was a nice present for him and also for David, who has his birthday today.”\n\nDavid Checa, ERC Endurance #6: “First of all, I am so happy to ride with BMW. It was my first experience with them and I was so excited because the engine is incredible. It has a lot of power from first to sixth gear and the bike is so easy to ride compared to the others I rode before. I just need to understand how to manage it but Ilya and Kenny have a lot of experience. They help me a lot to learn this bike. Step by step I will get to their rhythm because at the moment I am not yet on the level of Kenny and Ilya but I did my best. We did not expect to be on the podium as we did not test, but sometimes it happens! I am so happy to be back with Kenny and to be on the Le Mans podium with him.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I’ve done a lot of 24-hour races, but I’ve never experienced one as chaotic and slippery as today. There were so many crashes, and unfortunately, we went down three times as well. My teammates did a fantastic job. They were both really fast at the beginning but each had a crash. I then tried to bring it home but also slipped once. We were definitely in the fight, but it just wasn’t meant to be. Finishing fourth is a bit frustrating because we really wanted and deserved that podium. But it's clear we have the potential and we can fight for wins. Big thanks to my teammates and the entire team. It was an amazing week!”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was mad. It was really frantic from the very start because the track was very, very slippery. The 24 hours started really well. In the first one and a half hours, I felt really good and was leading. Then I got caught up with a backmarker and unfortunately crashed. The team did a fantastic job to repair the bike – and then again after Steven’s crash. They were really, really on point. Unfortunately we lost a bit too much time with the damage on the bike but I think everybody can be really proud of what we did today. It just wasn’t to be but we had speed, we were leading for quite a while and we were strong. There are still a lot of positives to take from this weekend and I think we are all very much looking forward to the next rounds.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “To be honest, it has definitely been the most difficult race of my life. I’ve never had to experience such terrible conditions during the night and during the day. A wet track drying and a dry track getting wet again, but I think the team did really well. We had some really big crashes and the team prepared the bike phenomenally well to get it back to working order. I am really happy, it was just unfortunate. It would have been nice to end up on the podium after all the troubles we had.”\n\nQualifying (combined).\n\nTati Team AVA6 Racing\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nCurrent World Championship standings (R01/04).\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 2025 season opener of the FIM EWC will go down as one of the most dramatic 24-hour races in history.

The French team T2C Racing (#2 BMW S 1000 RR) also retired early in the evening.\n\nThe second race of the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship, the 8 Hours of Spa Motos at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), will take place on June 7.\n\nReactions after the 24h Le Mans:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This 24-hour race is one we’ll all remember for a long time. The challenge of riding a race like Le Mans under such conditions was immense for everyone involved. That makes the strong performance of the BMW teams and riders all the more impressive. Congratulations to the entire ERC Endurance #6 team who managed to reach the podium in their first race in this lineup. Our factory team also proved its podium potential right to the very end. Many thanks to the team and the riders for their hard work and strong performance. What we saw at Le Mans gives us a lot of confidence for the rest of the FIM EWC season.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an absolutely emotional experience all around. Le Mans is always impressive, and endurance racing is full of passion. I think that passion was evident from the first to the last lap. The riders had to take big risks in extremely difficult conditions. By hour 22, there had already been more than 145 crashes – surely a record, but a sad one. Teams put in so much work and heart, and only a few got the reward. It was a real sporting challenge, and we’re very happy to have a BMW M 1000 RR on the podium. Congratulations to Uwe Reinhardt and the ERC crew. Our Werner Daemen-led factory team fought right to the last minute. We had crashes with all three riders; it was just that tough out there. Plus, we had a follow-up repair that cost us about 15 minutes, which was likely the small margin that kept us from the podium. We were a bit unlucky, but we’re happy with the many points we’re taking home. It’s a solid foundation for the rest of the season, and we’re looking forward to Spa, Werner Daemen’s home race. I think that track suits our BMW M 1000 RR well. You could already see its potential here.”\n\nKenny Foray, ERC Endurance #6: “The feeling is just incredible. It was an absolutely crazy race. I think it is not possible to imagine how we feel on the bike when you watch so many crashes like this. And when you go to your hospitality to take some rest and you see more crashes on TV, and you know that you soon have to be back on the bike again – this was really, really difficult. We had some problems but we did not crash, we stayed on the bike, and I think that was the key of the race. It is just an incredible moment. This is the first race for the team with the BMW M 1000 RR and we start with a podium. That is fantastic!”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik, ERC Endurance #6: “It feels nice because when you change the team you also want to have good results. Despite the fact that we did not ride or test a lot this winter we showed immediately, without any track time, our performance. It was great to be so competitive during the weekend and in the end, we were on the podium. I want to say a big thank you to BMW for the support and to Uwe Reinhardt, the Team Principal. It was a nice present for him and also for David, who has his birthday today.”\n\nDavid Checa, ERC Endurance #6: “First of all, I am so happy to ride with BMW. It was my first experience with them and I was so excited because the engine is incredible. It has a lot of power from first to sixth gear and the bike is so easy to ride compared to the others I rode before. I just need to understand how to manage it but Ilya and Kenny have a lot of experience. They help me a lot to learn this bike. Step by step I will get to their rhythm because at the moment I am not yet on the level of Kenny and Ilya but I did my best. We did not expect to be on the podium as we did not test, but sometimes it happens! I am so happy to be back with Kenny and to be on the Le Mans podium with him.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I’ve done a lot of 24-hour races, but I’ve never experienced one as chaotic and slippery as today. There were so many crashes, and unfortunately, we went down three times as well. My teammates did a fantastic job. They were both really fast at the beginning but each had a crash. I then tried to bring it home but also slipped once. We were definitely in the fight, but it just wasn’t meant to be. Finishing fourth is a bit frustrating because we really wanted and deserved that podium. But it's clear we have the potential and we can fight for wins. Big thanks to my teammates and the entire team. It was an amazing week!”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was mad. It was really frantic from the very start because the track was very, very slippery. The 24 hours started really well. In the first one and a half hours, I felt really good and was leading. Then I got caught up with a backmarker and unfortunately crashed. The team did a fantastic job to repair the bike – and then again after Steven’s crash. They were really, really on point. Unfortunately we lost a bit too much time with the damage on the bike but I think everybody can be really proud of what we did today. It just wasn’t to be but we had speed, we were leading for quite a while and we were strong. There are still a lot of positives to take from this weekend and I think we are all very much looking forward to the next rounds.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “To be honest, it has definitely been the most difficult race of my life. I’ve never had to experience such terrible conditions during the night and during the day. A wet track drying and a dry track getting wet again, but I think the team did really well. We had some really big crashes and the team prepared the bike phenomenally well to get it back to working order. I am really happy, it was just unfortunate. It would have been nice to end up on the podium after all the troubles we had.”\n\nQualifying (combined).\n\nTati Team AVA6 Racing\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nCurrent World Championship standings (R01/04).\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "FIM EWC: Podium finish at dramatic Le Mans season opener."}]}

The 2025 season opener of the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) will go down as one of the most dramatic 24-hour races in history. From start to finish, persistent rain during the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) created extremely treacherous conditions.

The factory team, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team (#37), was also among the top favourites and crossed the line in fourth place after 24 turbulent hours.\n\nAfter dry weather up until Friday, rain began right on schedule on race day Saturday. The track became extremely slippery, resulting in numerous crashes throughout the field. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with factory riders Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), Markus Reiterberger (GER), Steven Odendaal (GER), and reserve rider Hannes Soomer (EST) was not spared. The #37 BMW M 1000 RR led the field with a solid advantage during the chaotic early stages but over the following hours, the team – like nearly all others – suffered crashes and had to take a lengthy repair break. Nevertheless, Guintoli, Reiterberger, and Odendaal fought their way back, keeping their podium hopes alive.\n\nBMW Motorrad Motorsport was represented on the Le Mans podium by ERC Endurance #6, with riders Kenny Foray (FRA), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), and David Checa (ESP). The trio showed strong pace throughout race week with their #6 BMW M 1000 RR and rewarded themselves with third place.\n\nIn addition to these teams, four other private BMW squads competed at Le Mans. In the Superstock class, Team Étoile from Japan narrowly missed the podium, finishing fourth. On the #25 BMW M 1000 RR, riders Hikari Okubo, Kazuki Watanabe, and Motoharu Ito (all JPN) shared duties. The Hungarian Endurance Racing Team by Moto Jungle claimed the celebrated pole position in the Superstock class with the #713 BMW M 1000 RR. However, the race also proved to be eventful for this Hungarian trio – Bálint Kovács, Máté Számado, and Soma Görbe.

On the occasion of Art Basel Hong Kong 2024, BMW and Alex Israel will present REMEMBR, an AI-powered, participatory and interactive video installation that guides visitors on a journey through time and memory in a captivating fusion of art and technology. The engaging installation will celebrate its debut in Asia and revolves around the all- electric BMW i7 and its innovative in-car experience features. REMEMBR will be exhibited from March 28 to 30, 2024, at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre (HKCEC). As Global Partner of Art Basel, BMW will once again provide the VIP car service at the show.\n\nAlex Israel is an esteemed contemporary artist based in Los Angeles, known for his innovative and thought-provoking work that often explores the intersection of popular culture, art and technology. His body of work, which includes paintings, sculpture and mixed-media installations, frequently draws inspiration from the vibrant culture and iconic imagery of his hometown. Israel's unique artistic perspective allows him to capture the zeitgeist of modern life in a way that is both insightful and engaging. REMEMBR, which evolved in collaboration with BMW using the BMW i5 as a pivotal inspiration, premiered at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2023. For the Asian debut in Hong Kong, it will be further developed and centred around the all-electric BMW i7. The video installation showcases Israel’s commitment to exploring the boundaries of what art can be in the digital age.\n\n\"For more than 50 years, BMW has collaborated with some of the most creative and inspiring artists in the world – while promoting the creative spirit that drives our brand forward and inspires us all,” says Raymond Tan, Managing Director, BMW Group Importer Region Hong Kong Macau and Taiwan. “We’re thrilled to collaborate with Alex Israel on this project and to celebrate the Asia premiere together with the all-electric BMW i7 at Art Basel Hong Kong.\"\n\nIsrael worked closely with BMW to develop AI technology that will collect, filter, compose and choreograph the visitor’s phone’s camera content. In an immersive installation across seven custom-designed screens, guests are invited to discover the hyper-memories of Alex Israel and, equally, share their own.\n\n\"Working on REMEMBR with BMW has been an incredible learning experience. After the premiere of REMEMBR at Art Basel Miami Beach, I had the opportunity to further develop my initial concept on the basis of the BMW i7,\" said Alex Israel. \"I often say that my real studio is my car. I get most of my ideas while I’m driving. I experience it as a very inspiring process: it brings back countless memories, sparks my imagination, and helps me to generate new memories and new ideas. The i7, with its AI technology and the My Modes feature, resonated for me as a milestone in the evolution of human-machine relationships. This car is an individually tailored capsule, a vessel for traveling through the world, but also through ones own subconscious mind. In a similar vein, our smartphones have evolved from mere communication devices into digital diaries and external hard drives for our memories. REMEMBR aims to revisit and share these memories in an engaging way. I'm excited for visitors to explore it and themselves this March at Art Basel Hong Kong.\"\n\nREMEMBR reflects BMW’s commitment to innovation, cutting-edge technology and luxury design, which are key features of the BMW i7. The i7 represents the joy of moving forward as a symbol of integration and an empowering mindset. It represents the emotional spearhead that combines tech magic, comfort, and human-centric design in a fully electric vehicle. The BMW My Modes allow the car to respond to the driver’s mindset with different sensory environments, creating a human-centred approach to the use of technology.\n\nExperience REMEMBR and the all-electric BMW i7:March 28–30, 2024BMW Lounge at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) – Level 3 Concourse1 Harbour Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong SAR, China\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i7 xDrive60: Power consumption in kWh/100 km (combined, WLTP): 19.6–18.4; Electric range in km (WLTP): 591–625; CO2 emissions: 0 g/km."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On the occasion of Art Basel Hong Kong 2024, BMW and Alex Israel will present REMEMBR, an AI-powered, participatory and interactive video installation that guides visitors on a journey through time and memory in a captivating fusion of art and technology.

After the premiere of REMEMBR at Art Basel Miami Beach, I had the opportunity to further develop my initial concept on the basis of the BMW i7,\" said Alex Israel. \"I often say that my real studio is my car. I get most of my ideas while I’m driving. I experience it as a very inspiring process: it brings back countless memories, sparks my imagination, and helps me to generate new memories and new ideas. The i7, with its AI technology and the My Modes feature, resonated for me as a milestone in the evolution of human-machine relationships. This car is an individually tailored capsule, a vessel for traveling through the world, but also through ones own subconscious mind. In a similar vein, our smartphones have evolved from mere communication devices into digital diaries and external hard drives for our memories. REMEMBR aims to revisit and share these memories in an engaging way. I'm excited for visitors to explore it and themselves this March at Art Basel Hong Kong.\"\n\nREMEMBR reflects BMW’s commitment to innovation, cutting-edge technology and luxury design, which are key features of the BMW i7. The i7 represents the joy of moving forward as a symbol of integration and an empowering mindset.

Season two for the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the GTP class of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) begins on 27th/28th January with the highlight at the start, the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). Eight BMW M works drivers will start for BMW M Team RLL in the two LMDh cars. In the qualifying session at the conclusion of the ‘Roar before the 24’, the test weekend immediately before the race, Connor De Phillippi (USA) drove the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 to the fourth starting position. In the #24 sister car, Jesse Krohn (FIN) was eighth. Five more BMW M works drivers will be in action in the two BMW M4 GT3s which compete in the GTD categories.\n\nDe Phillippi was 0.366 seconds off pole position with a qualifying time of 1:33.022 minutes and has a good start position for the race from the second row. He shares the cockpit with Nick Yelloly (GBR), Maxime Martin (BEL), and René Rast (GER). Alongside Krohn, Philipp Eng (AUT), Augusto Farfus (BRA), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) will drive the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8.\n\nFor the Paul Miller Racing team, three BMW M works drivers will take the wheel of the #1 BMW M4 GT3 in the GTD-PRO class. Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen (both USA), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) form a quartet with Bryan Sellers (USA). They start from position twelve in their category. Robby Foley (USA) and Jens Klingmann (GER) are part of the Turner Motorsport crew in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 in the GTD class and, together with Patrick Gallagher and Jake Walker (both USA), start from position 16 in their category.\n\nThe 24-hour race begins on Saturday, 27th January, at 13:40 local time (19:40 CET). On Friday, 26th January at 13:45 local time (19:45 CET), the BMW M Endurance Challenge takes place. At the season opener of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge, five BMW M4 GT4s are on the starting grid of the 4-hour race.\n\nQuotes before the race:\n\nBobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW M Team RLL): “We arrived at last year’s Rolex 24 having just finished giving birth to the BMW M Hybrid V8 programme in the last quarter of 2022. While I was generally pleased with our performance – one of the cars staying on the lead lap until the 22nd hour – this year we arrive at Daytona better prepared. If that preparation translates into increased reliability, we can expect a very good Rolex 24.”\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, 4th starting position): “In qualifying we had the best car of the whole weekend. We are satisfied that we have made a good step in the right direction. There is still some optimisation to be done here and there, but I am happy for the team about the significantly better result compared to last year. We are slowly but surely getting to where we need to be to close the gap. The race is long, and a lot can happen. We are ready for the action.”\n\nJesse Krohn (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, 8th starting position): “This is not the place where I wanted to end the session. I didn't get everything together for a fast lap after we had focussed on race speed and not on qualifying in the test sessions. Of course, it would be better to start further ahead, but we definitely have a much better car for the race than the start position suggests.

Decorated with five driver and two team titles, BMW M Motorsport enters the DTM season 2025. Schubert Motorsport is aiming to defend their team title with two new BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars, as well as seeking their second driver's title since 2022. Behind the wheels of the two cars are three-time DTM champion René Rast and two-time title holder Marco Wittmann (both GER). The two BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will sport the colours of BMW M Motorsport Premium Partners RoboMarkets and Schaeffler .\n\nBoth Rast and Wittmann remain loyal to their colours from previous seasons. Since his switch to BMW M Motorsport in the 2023 season, Rast has been starting in the blue and black of RoboMarkets. Wittmann's “Green Machine” from Schaeffler has been his trademark in the DTM since 2019. In 2024, Rast secured two victories, one second place, and one third place. Wittmann celebrated one victory and one third place. Schubert Motorsport achieved a total of four victories and three additional podium finishes on their way to the team title.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT3 EVO will also compete in the ADAC GT Masters, with both Schubert Motorsport and FK Performance Motorsport fielding the car. In the ADAC GT4 Germany, the BMW M4 GT4 EVO will have its debut season.\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “In the 2025 DTM season, we are once again strongly positioned with the reigning team champions from Schubert Motorsport and the two DTM stars René Rast and Marco Wittmann. Additionally, the EVO version of our BMW M4 GT3 has already proved its ability to win in its first races. We have created all the conditions necessary to compete for titles in both the drivers' and team standings in the upcoming season. That is our clear goal. We are also very well represented in the ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. We are excited about this strong presence of BMW M Motorsport at the DTM race weekends and aim to compete for victories and titles in all racing series and with all cars.”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “We are entering the new DTM season with great ambitions. Our clear goal is to fight for the title until the end – both in the drivers' and team standings. After 2022, we want to bring the drivers' title back to Oschersleben and at the same time successfully defend the team title from last year. We have already gained initial experience with the new BMW M4 GT3 EVO, but there are still some unknowns, especially concerning the new tyres. Even though we are starting with two cars this season, we are convinced that we are strongly positioned, and it is even more important for us to be at the front in every race and secure crucial points for the team standings. In parallel, we are pleased to be represented again in the ADAC GT Masters. The series is an important part of our history, and it's great to be involved again.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I am thrilled to be able to start again in the DTM with Schaeffler and the 'Green Machine' in 2025. In my second season with Schubert Motorsport, my goal is to fight for podium places and victories. If we manage to do this regularly, we can also have a say in the title race. Focusing on two cars certainly helps the team to concentrate its efforts even more. Additionally, we want to improve further compared to the past DTM season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “My goal for the upcoming DTM season is clear: I want to win my fourth drivers' title. Of course, we also want to be at the forefront in the team standings, but ultimately, winning the drivers' championship is of the highest importance – naturally for me personally, but also for the team. I haven't driven the BMW M4 GT3 EVO yet, but based on everything I've heard from my fellow drivers so far, I'm hoping for a leap forward.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Decorated with five driver and two team titles, BMW M Motorsport enters the DTM season 2025.

At the world’s most famous road race event, BMW M 1000 RR riders dominated the races for 1000cc motorcycles. At the 2024 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, they celebrated a triple 1-2 finish. In all three 1000cc races held, there were three wins and second places for the BMW M 1000 RR. The man of the week was Davey Todd (GBR), who first won the Superstock race and then claimed victory in the prestigious Senior TT. Peter Hickman (GBR) was victorious in the Superbike race. These two, along with Josh Brookes (AUS), also took second places on the podiums. With this, the BMW road racers continued the success story for the brand on the Isle of Man, which began exactly 85 years ago with the first victory by Georg Meier.\n\nIt all started on Sunday, 2nd June, with the Superbike TT race. In an exciting race, Hickman, riding the BMW M 1000 RR of the Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing team, secured his 14th TT win overall. Todd followed on the Milwaukee BMW Motorrad by TAS Racing M RR in second place, making the event’s first 1-2 success perfect.\n\nAfter bad weather had repeatedly caused dangerous conditions and numerous delays, the first of two planned Superstock TT races was held on Thursday, 6th June. Todd’s star finally rose as he engaged in a close duel with Hickman and ultimately came out on top. Todd celebrated his first-ever victory at the Isle of Man TT, while Hickman stood on the podium as the second-place finisher. The second Superstock race could not be held due to weather conditions and delays.\n\nThe highlight of the Isle of Man TT is always the prestigious Senior TT. On the late afternoon of Saturday, 8th June, the world’s best road racers took to the final showdown of this race week. In the end, it was again Todd who almost incredulously celebrated his next triumph with a large lead and inscribed his name in the renowned Senior TT winners’ list. For his team, Milwaukee BMW Motorrad by TAS Racing, it was the first victory in this very special race, the Senior TT, in 20 years – accordingly, the jubilation was immense. The second-place finisher was equally enthusiastically received by his team Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing at the finish line; Australian Brookes secured his first podium in the Senior TT after a previously challenging race week. Team-mate Hickman was dominating the early stages of the Senior TT but a crash ended his path to another potential victory. Hickman was unharmed.\n\nSince 2014, BMW road racers have been successful on the Isle of Man with the BMW S 1000 RR and the BMW M 1000 RR. The meeting has been held nine times since then (the 2020 and 2021 events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and they have had no fewer than 22 TT victories.\n\nReactions after the 2024 Isle of Man TT.\n\nMarc Bongers, Sporting Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Wow, what an Isle of Man TT! Of course, we had certain expectations beforehand, as BMW road racers have been among the absolute favourites for years, but with 1-2s in all three 1000cc races, even our expectations were exceeded. Congratulations to Davey Todd, who fulfilled a dream with victories in the Superstock TT and then in the prestigious Senior TT, to Peter Hickman, who further expanded his impressive TT victory tally in the Superbike race, and also to Josh Brookes, who for the first time stood on the coveted podium of the Senior TT in second. Congratulations also to the TAS Racing and FHO BMW Motorrad Racing teams, whose hard work made it possible to continue BMW Motorrad’s success story on the Isle of Man with these fantastic results. A big thank you also goes to the many other BMW road racers who again brought numerous RRs of all generations to the start at the Isle of Man this year, also serving as great ambassadors for BMW bikes.”\n\nDavey Todd, Milwaukee BMW Motorrad by TAS Racing: “It’s doesn’t feel real, my first TT win and then victory in the Senior TT. We’ve been feeling good the whole time. I just wanted to be in the battle for the win. I knew we had a chance and to give this Senior TT win to the team is awesome. Those last two laps in the Senior TT were the longest laps in my life after I came to the pits seeing I was in P1 with a big gap riding around there, short shifting, nursing the bike. But the Milwaukee BMW Motorrad by TAS Racing team built me a fantastic BMW M 1000 RR. I absolutely love riding it. It never missed a beat. And then the best of pit stops – I got to give all to the team. Now I actually can’t wait 12 months to come back here again. I absolutely loved this TT. This is going to take a while to sink in. This TT has been a dream coming true for me.”\n\nPeter Hickman, Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing: “It’s a rather mixed bag of results for myself with a Superbike TT win, on the podium for the Superstock race and a crash at Ginger Hall whilst leading the Senior TT. A massive thank you to the Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing team for all their hard work and dedication over this year’s TT. It was a bit frustrating with the lack of track time due to the weather but the bikes have been awesome. Also I must say well done for a mega result for Josh with P2 in the Senior TT. I also want to thank everyone for their messages, I am a bit bruised and very lucky.”\n\nJosh Brookes, Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing: “Honestly, after a week with problems I wasn’t expecting to be at the podium so with second place I feel like I’ve won it. It’s unreal, honestly. A lot of people obviously went out but that’s how it is at TT. You’ve got to take them when you get them, so I’m thrilled. I felt like this is my class, this is the bike I feel the best on. On the big bike I normally ride every weekend in the British Superbike Championship, I feel like home, like it’s my bike, and I feel like I can ride my way on that bike. The BMW M 1000 RR worked perfectly. I went the quickest I have ever been around the course and I genuinely felt like the bike was working superbly. I couldn’t be happier. A big thank you to everyone involved at the Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing team. To come away with such a result in the big race is mega.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At the world’s most famous road race event, BMW M 1000 RR riders dominated the races for 1000cc motorcycles.

It’s unreal, honestly. A lot of people obviously went out but that’s how it is at TT. You’ve got to take them when you get them, so I’m thrilled. I felt like this is my class, this is the bike I feel the best on. On the big bike I normally ride every weekend in the British Superbike Championship, I feel like home, like it’s my bike, and I feel like I can ride my way on that bike. The BMW M 1000 RR worked perfectly. I went the quickest I have ever been around the course and I genuinely felt like the bike was working superbly. I couldn’t be happier. A big thank you to everyone involved at the Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing team. To come away with such a result in the big race is mega.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2024 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy: Triple 1-2 for BMW M 1000 RR racers."}]}

At the 2024 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, they celebrated a triple 1-2 finish. In all three 1000cc races held, there were three wins and second places for the BMW M 1000 RR.Munich. At the world’s most famous road race event, BMW M 1000 RR riders dominated the races for 1000cc motorcycles. At the 2024 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, they celebrated a triple 1-2 finish. In all three 1000cc races held, there were three wins and second places for the BMW M 1000 RR. The man of the week was Davey Todd (GBR), who first won the Superstock race and then claimed victory in the prestigious Senior TT. Peter Hickman (GBR) was victorious in the Superbike race. These two, along with Josh Brookes (AUS), also took second places on the podiums. With this, the BMW road racers continued the success story for the brand on the Isle of Man, which began exactly 85 years ago with the first victory by Georg Meier.\n\nIt all started on Sunday, 2nd June, with the Superbike TT race. In an exciting race, Hickman, riding the BMW M 1000 RR of the Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing team, secured his 14th TT win overall. Todd followed on the Milwaukee BMW Motorrad by TAS Racing M RR in second place, making the event’s first 1-2 success perfect.\n\nAfter bad weather had repeatedly caused dangerous conditions and numerous delays, the first of two planned Superstock TT races was held on Thursday, 6th June. Todd’s star finally rose as he engaged in a close duel with Hickman and ultimately came out on top. Todd celebrated his first-ever victory at the Isle of Man TT, while Hickman stood on the podium as the second-place finisher. The second Superstock race could not be held due to weather conditions and delays.\n\nThe highlight of the Isle of Man TT is always the prestigious Senior TT. On the late afternoon of Saturday, 8th June, the world’s best road racers took to the final showdown of this race week. In the end, it was again Todd who almost incredulously celebrated his next triumph with a large lead and inscribed his name in the renowned Senior TT winners’ list. For his team, Milwaukee BMW Motorrad by TAS Racing, it was the first victory in this very special race, the Senior TT, in 20 years – accordingly, the jubilation was immense. The second-place finisher was equally enthusiastically received by his team Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing at the finish line; Australian Brookes secured his first podium in the Senior TT after a previously challenging race week. Team-mate Hickman was dominating the early stages of the Senior TT but a crash ended his path to another potential victory. Hickman was unharmed.\n\nSince 2014, BMW road racers have been successful on the Isle of Man with the BMW S 1000 RR and the BMW M 1000 RR. The meeting has been held nine times since then (the 2020 and 2021 events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and they have had no fewer than 22 TT victories.\n\nReactions after the 2024 Isle of Man TT.\n\nMarc Bongers, Sporting Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Wow, what an Isle of Man TT! Of course, we had certain expectations beforehand, as BMW road racers have been among the absolute favourites for years, but with 1-2s in all three 1000cc races, even our expectations were exceeded. Congratulations to Davey Todd, who fulfilled a dream with victories in the Superstock TT and then in the prestigious Senior TT, to Peter Hickman, who further expanded his impressive TT victory tally in the Superbike race, and also to Josh Brookes, who for the first time stood on the coveted podium of the Senior TT in second. Congratulations also to the TAS Racing and FHO BMW Motorrad Racing teams, whose hard work made it possible to continue BMW Motorrad’s success story on the Isle of Man with these fantastic results. A big thank you also goes to the many other BMW road racers who again brought numerous RRs of all generations to the start at the Isle of Man this year, also serving as great ambassadors for BMW bikes.”\n\nDavey Todd, Milwaukee BMW Motorrad by TAS Racing: “It’s doesn’t feel real, my first TT win and then victory in the Senior TT. We’ve been feeling good the whole time. I just wanted to be in the battle for the win. I knew we had a chance and to give this Senior TT win to the team is awesome. Those last two laps in the Senior TT were the longest laps in my life after I came to the pits seeing I was in P1 with a big gap riding around there, short shifting, nursing the bike. But the Milwaukee BMW Motorrad by TAS Racing team built me a fantastic BMW M 1000 RR. I absolutely love riding it. It never missed a beat. And then the best of pit stops – I got to give all to the team. Now I actually can’t wait 12 months to come back here again. I absolutely loved this TT. This is going to take a while to sink in. This TT has been a dream coming true for me.”\n\nPeter Hickman, Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing: “It’s a rather mixed bag of results for myself with a Superbike TT win, on the podium for the Superstock race and a crash at Ginger Hall whilst leading the Senior TT. A massive thank you to the Monster Energy BMW by FHO Racing team for all their hard work and dedication over this year’s TT.

At the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER) on 21st/22nd June 2025, the BMW M2 Racing will complete its final major endurance test before the sales launch, with a high-profile driver lineup. Belgian drivers Ugo de Wilde and Charles Weerts, along with German driver Jens Klingmann – who has been involved in the testing and development of the vehicle from the very beginning – will take the wheel as a trio of BMW M works drivers in the cockpit of the new entry-level model from BMW M Motorsport. They will be joined by experienced Nürburgring racer and motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER). The car will be fielded by FK Performance Motorsport.\n\nMedia guide with all information on the BMW M2 Racing: \n\nThe BMW M2 Racing has already completed more than 30,000 test kilometres and will be available to BMW M Motorsport customer teams as the ideal entry-level race car from the 2026 season. In this final major test, the car will compete in the SP3T class and be put through its paces by the drivers and team under the extreme conditions of an endurance race. Klingmann has been actively involved in every stage of the BMW M2 Racing’s development and has played a key role in preparing the car for launch. De Wilde recently earned his Nordschleife permit and will make his 24-hour race debut. Weerts finished third overall in 2024 and now trades his GT3 seat for valuable test duties with BMW M Motorsport. Bräutigam has driven many race cars and will bring a journalistic perspective to the BMW M2 Racing thanks to his extensive experience. FK Performance Motorsport oversaw the car’s debut at the first test race in the 2024 Nürburgring Endurance Series and will manage it again during the Qualifiers and the 24h race in 2025. At the Qualifiers this coming weekend, Weerts, de Wilde, and Bräutigam will take turns at the wheel, with Klingmann joining for the 24-hour race.\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “With the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring, the intensive test and development phase of our new entry-level car, the BMW M2 Racing, comes to an end. For one final time, our works drivers will collect data and impressions to help us deliver a car to our customers that is as well-prepared as possible. The Eifel endurance race is the ultimate test of strength. I’m delighted that we can also give the media the exclusive opportunity to experience the car’s performance firsthand.”\n\nUgo de Wilde: “I can’t wait to be there. I did my permit on the Nordschleife this year and I really love the track. It is an amazing circuit and the atmosphere around there was already fantastic in NLS so I can’t wait to discover the 24–hour race and to compete there with the brand new BMW M2 Racing. It’s really excting; I’ve heard really good comments from Charles and the other drivers who opportunity to test it already.”\n\nJens Klingmann: “The 24 Hours of Nürburgring marks the final major dress rehearsal for our BMW M2 Racing. We’ve completed a long and intensive testing and development phase and have covered a lot of kilometres. Now we’re especially looking forward to putting the car through its paces once more in race conditions, to ensure we can hand over a perfectly developed BMW M2 Racing to our customers. I believe we are very well prepared. We’ve simulated every scenario for all areas of use – whether on the Nordschleife, in other championships, or for track days. Of course, things are always a bit different in real race conditions. For example, you see how driver changes go, or whether everything is finalised on the software side. So this is truly the final big test before production begins.”\n\nCharles Weerts: “I can’t wait to be at the Nordschleife for a legendary race, the 24 hours. I’ve got lucky enough to be driving their last year with the BMW M4 GT3, with Max Hesse and Dan Harper, and we finished third on our first attempt together which is definitely a nice memory. This year we come back with a different approach and different goals. I will be sharing duties with Jens Klingmann, Ugo de Wilde and Michael Bräutigam in the new BMW M2 Racing where we will do our best for BMW M Motorsport to optimally develop this car for the customer in 2026.

At the Qualifiers this coming weekend, Weerts, de Wilde, and Bräutigam will take turns at the wheel, with Klingmann joining for the 24-hour race.\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “With the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring, the intensive test and development phase of our new entry-level car, the BMW M2 Racing, comes to an end. For one final time, our works drivers will collect data and impressions to help us deliver a car to our customers that is as well-prepared as possible. The Eifel endurance race is the ultimate test of strength. I’m delighted that we can also give the media the exclusive opportunity to experience the car’s performance firsthand.”\n\nUgo de Wilde: “I can’t wait to be there. I did my permit on the Nordschleife this year and I really love the track. It is an amazing circuit and the atmosphere around there was already fantastic in NLS so I can’t wait to discover the 24–hour race and to compete there with the brand new BMW M2 Racing. It’s really excting; I’ve heard really good comments from Charles and the other drivers who opportunity to test it already.”\n\nJens Klingmann: “The 24 Hours of Nürburgring marks the final major dress rehearsal for our BMW M2 Racing. We’ve completed a long and intensive testing and development phase and have covered a lot of kilometres. Now we’re especially looking forward to putting the car through its paces once more in race conditions, to ensure we can hand over a perfectly developed BMW M2 Racing to our customers. I believe we are very well prepared. We’ve simulated every scenario for all areas of use – whether on the Nordschleife, in other championships, or for track days. Of course, things are always a bit different in real race conditions. For example, you see how driver changes go, or whether everything is finalised on the software side. So this is truly the final big test before production begins.”\n\nCharles Weerts: “I can’t wait to be at the Nordschleife for a legendary race, the 24 hours. I’ve got lucky enough to be driving their last year with the BMW M4 GT3, with Max Hesse and Dan Harper, and we finished third on our first attempt together which is definitely a nice memory. This year we come back with a different approach and different goals. I will be sharing duties with Jens Klingmann, Ugo de Wilde and Michael Bräutigam in the new BMW M2 Racing where we will do our best for BMW M Motorsport to optimally develop this car for the customer in 2026. I am very much looking forward to see how this car will handle in the ‘Green Hell’ and can’t wait to be there again.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

From R&D to validation, BMW has built its largest e-mobility R&D footprint outside of Germany in China. In China, for the World: BMW Group Tech Office Asia-Pacific in Shanghai focuses on tech scouting of advanced technologies and innovations.Shanghai. On July 18, 2023, the BMW Group further expanded its R&D footprint in China with the opening of a new R&D Center in Shanghai. China is already home to BMW Group’s largest R&D system outside of Germany, with locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and Nanjing. Based on the concept of open innovation, all BMW’s R&D functions in China have been merged together under one roof for efficient collaboration and high-speed performance. BMW has now built-up fully-fledged R&D competency and software development capabilities for full-stack ICV development in China, putting the company in the perfect position to further implementing its China strategy.\n\nMr. Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development, said, “The NEUE KLASSE of BMW will redefine driving pleasure. With our fascinating products and premium mobility experience, the BMW Group moves body, heart and mind empowered by digitalisation. Our new R&D Center and BMW China R&D upgrade will enable us to achieve a real competence push. Within the last three years, we have tripled our forces in China. Today, more than 3,200 designers and engineers, NEV and software specialists are creating leading-edge innovations in close collaboration with Chinese tech players, start-ups, local partners as well as academia. China is the place to be. Going forward, there will be a lot more China in our worldwide R&D organisation.”\n\nA future-oriented R&D strategy and innovation mindset has been central to the BMW Group’s rise to its leadership position in the global automotive industry. The company opened FIZ, its renowned R&D Center in Munich in 1990. Today, the BMW Group R&D network covers 17 countries. China has established the largest R&D and innovation network outside Germany, with facilities and processes as advanced as the headquarters and numerous innovation partnerships.\n\nBMW believes that China is the place to be for future mobility. In April, BMW further upgraded its R&D management in China, bringing all development functions in China under one roof and the leadership of Dr. Robert Kahlenberg. This move not only strengthens the synergy across different R&D functions in China, but will better integrate the China R&D network and its innovation capabilities into BMW Group’s worldwide R&D organization. In addition, innovation and future trends will be scouted and assessed earlier in order to better meet the needs of Chinese customers. Within BMW Group’s global R&D network, China is the only country outside Germany with full-process R&D capabilities. There are now 3,200 R&D associates in China using their expertise to develop fascinating products for Chinese customers. For instance, in the BMW Operating System 9, 70% of the functions are tailor-made for Chinese customers. What’s more, BMW’s China R&D team has been deeply involved in the design, development, testing and validation of the locally-produced all-electric BMW i5.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE, BMW’s next generation of all-electric models, will write a whole new book in terms of technological development. BMW's R&D and design teams in China are deeply involved in many key aspects of the development of the NEUE KLASSE models. A number of China innovations will become highlights of the upcoming NEUE KLASSE models.\n\nBy focusing on human-machine interaction and hardware-software integration, BMW is taking the digital user experience to the next-level in China.\n\nHuman-machine interaction is a vital part of the user experience. Currently, China is the only market outside Germany that has Skylab, the human-machine interaction design team, and usability lab with all core design functions, covering user experience design, visual design, usability research and the development of human-machine interaction. The facility fully demonstrates BMW’s systematic, precise and advanced approach to usability research based on simulation models. The usability research team consists of designers, software engineers, cognitive psychologists, and more. The specific team conducting usability research during the development of the BMW Operating System 9 included experts with over eight years of experience on average, including some with psychology PhDs. Over a 15-month period, they listened to feedback from hundreds of Chinese customers and customers from other countries and regions.\n\nBMW places a lot of emphasis on the importance of hardware-software integration in car development, with leading-edge software considered essential for a next-level user experience. In China, BA TechWorks in Nanjing will expand their software team to 500 associates by the end of 2023, with software development capabilities for full stack development of Intelligent Connected Vehicles. BMW’s software development department was established in 2002 and now located in Mountain View (USA), Lisbon and Porto (Portugal), Munich and Ulm (Germany), Tokyo (Japan) and Shanghai, Beijing and Nanjing (China), with over 8,000 software specialists worldwide. The team develops an average of around 100,000 software builds per day and processes around 3,000 builds per hour in parallel.\n\nDesignworks Shanghai as local design studio of BMW Group even deeper integrated in R&D centre to bridge the East and the West\n\nIn 2023, Designworks started its second decade in China and will further integrate with BMW’s world-leading digital development processes based on LED and VR technology, to empower future design through digitalization. The studio space and its technological features greatly improve the effectiveness of the design team, their workflow and global collaboration. More than 25 years ago BMW AG acquired Designworks to serve as the eyes and ears of the BMW Group to the world. Designworks started its operation in Shanghai in 2012 and became a bridge between Western and Chinese aesthetics and a leading force in automotive design. Recently, the design of BMW models worldwide has increasingly reflected the beauty of Chinese culture and modern Chinese values, with a bolder, more striking and more confident flair.\n\nBMW has long led the way in advanced digital R&D, building excellent user experiences for global customers. The BMW Group Driving Simulation Center located in Munich covers an area of some 11,400 square metres, and is equipped with 14 simulators with the capacity of 100 simulations per day. Tests include innovative entertainment technologies, user interfaces and operating concepts, multi-mode interaction between users and the vehicle, chassis tuning, driver assistance functions and even fully-automated driving scenarios. These tests greatly speed up the development and significantly reduce the environmental impact during the R&D processes.\n\nFrom R&D to validation, BMW has built its largest e-mobility R&D footprint outside of Germany in China\n\nThe BMW Group established its first battery center outside of Germany with full battery capabilities in China in 2017. The BMW Shenyang R&D Center has been focusing on electrification technology development, product localization, calibration, and validation for over 10 years. T he recently expanded Shenyang R&D Centre Phase II has further strengthened BMW's full process development and validation capabilities for locally-produced new energy vehicles. The facility includes 19 new laboratories, 17 of which are dedicated to testing new energy vehicles.\n\nChina is also home to BMW’s largest testing and validation footprint outside of Germany. The Shenyang R&D Centre has a global-leading EMC laboratory. In the anti-interference test, the general standard in the industry requires 30 V/m, while the electric field intensity in BMW EMC lab could reach 100V/m on average and up to 140 V/m in extreme test conditions. BMW also owns a professional NVH laboratory in Shenyang, including an acoustic hub Dyno laboratory and outdoor test track, which can run strict tests of noise outside and inside the cabin. The High-Voltage Battery (HVB) testing lab can simulate extreme conditions to ensure the high-performance and safety of high-voltage batteries in all conditions. The high-voltage battery of the all-new BMW i3 underwent 155 hardware tests and 994 software function tests during the development process.\n\nAll BMW vehicles will undergo rigorous vehicle testing prior to launch, at geographical locations from 71 degrees north to 25 degrees south latitude, and temperatures from -40 degrees to 46 degrees. The extreme testing ensures all new models will provide excellent performance for customers whatever the weather and road condition. In addition, all models launched in China will undergo vehicle endurance testing in the special environments of high altitude, high humidity, high temperature and extreme cold in China. The test contents include the powertrain system, the battery, the motor, the control units, and the dynamic performance.\n\nThanks to the fully-fledged BEV R&D and testing capabilities in China, the BMW Group has already launched locally-produced BEVs including the BMW i3, BMW iX1 and BMW iX3, as well as imported BEVs including the BMW i4, BMW i7 and BMW iX. Meanwhile, the locally produced BMW i5, will be unveiled this year.\n\nIn China, for the World: BMW Group Tech Office Asia-Pacific in Shanghai focuses on tech scouting of advanced technologies and innovations\n\nBMW Group is a strong believer in innovation through collaboration, and is constantly scouting for global innovators in new technologies and future mobility trends. In 2013, BMW Group Tech Office was established in Shanghai. It focuses on the future mobility pillars of Electric, Digital and Circular. BMW collaborates with innovative companies and even offers platforms for innovative start-ups to enter the automotive market with the help of BMW. BMW Tech Office covers different tech fields like generative AI, AR/VR, sustainability and digital solutions. 2023 marks the 10th anniversary of the Tech office, and the center has been upgraded to the BMW Group Tech Office Asia Pacific, based in China but feeding back innovations for the world.\n\nBMW is also expanding its circle of joint innovation partners.

An international mix of emerging talents and household names provide the BMW XM with a new creative context. Coachella performers like Charli XCX, Earthgang and Uncle Waffles, plus German rapper du jour Badmomzjay, Grammy Award winner Nija Charles and South Korean choreographer Leejung Lee, will record their initial encounters with the first electrified high-performance model from BMW M GmbH in their own individual style: Dare to be you.\n\nBMW in the spotlight as it helps to shape the zeitgeist.\n\nBMW has a clear mission: to create a platform where cultural pioneers can truly show us what they’re all about. As Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Communication, Brand Experience, says: “Our goal at BMW is to be at the heart of where creative magic happens. We want to enable artists – musicians, designers, actors, storytellers – to express themselves and to interact with our brand and our latest, already widely desired launch: the first-ever BMW XM. Coachella is an excellent platform through which to develop fresh conversations with talented emerging artists as well as established stars.\n\nSpectacular backdrops for incredible pictures.\n\nPhoto and video sessions are both on the agenda again in California. And it’s not just the Coachella Festival setting that provides an inspirational location for unique shots.

In 2025, BMW M Motorsport will enter its second season in the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and its third in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) with the BMW M Hybrid V8. To achieve its ambitious goals in both race series, BMW M Motorsport joins its forces in terms of driver line-up. Eight BMW M works drivers will share the driving duties for BMW M Team WRT in the FIA WEC and BMW M Team RLL in the IMSA series. New to the team is Formula 1 driver Kevin Magnussen (DEN). He will be joined by Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), René Rast (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) .\n\nIn the BMW M Team WRT line-up for the FIA WEC, there is one change compared to the debut season. In the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Magnussen will start alongside Marciello and Vanthoor. The crew of car #20 remains unchanged with Frijns, Rast, and van der Linde. Wittmann continues as a regular driver in the LMDh programme but switches from the FIA WEC to the IMSA series with BMW M Team RLL. Eng stays in North America and will enter his third season with the BMW M Hybrid V8 there. Van der Linde and Vanthoor will take on a dual role, competing as regular drivers in both the FIA WEC and the full IMSA season. Vanthoor and Eng will share the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, while van der Linde and Wittmann will drive the #25 sister car.\n\nDue to scheduling conflicts between the two racing series, only two drivers per car will participate in the FIA WEC event at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) in May. Vanthoor and van der Linde will simultaneously race in the IMSA event at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nFor the endurance races of the IMSA series at Daytona, Sebring, and Road Atlanta (all USA), the other four LMDh drivers will supplement the line-ups. Magnussen will compete in all three races in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, with Marciello joining as the fourth driver at Daytona. In car #25, Frijns will drive all three races, with Rast completing the Daytona quartet.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We have high goals for the upcoming season with our BMW M Hybrid V8 prototypes. To achieve these, we are striving for optimisations in all areas. For our driver line-up, this means focusing and specialising. The more time our drivers spend behind the wheel of the BMW M Hybrid V8, the better they will get to know its handling and the more feedback they can provide to our engineers. The goal is to intensify the development of the BMW M Hybrid V8 in collaboration with the specialists at the teams and at BMW M Motorsport. It also helps us in this regard, that some drivers compete in both championships, thereby further improving the exchange of information. We are convinced that this way joining our forces will bring us advantages. Of course, the schedule overlap in May is not ideal, but we have the regulatory option to compete in a 6-hour FIA WEC race with two drivers per car, which we will utilise. The fact that the season starts in January with the 24-hour race at Daytona is very beneficial for us. This allows us to have all eight drivers together for an extended period early in the season, helping us to optimally synchronise with each other.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 2025, BMW M Motorsport will enter its second season in the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and its third in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) with the BMW M Hybrid V8.

To achieve its ambitious goals in both race series, BMW M Motorsport joins its forces in terms of driver line-up. Eight BMW M works drivers will share the driving duties for BMW M Team WRT in the FIA WEC and BMW M Team RLL in the IMSA series.Munich.

To achieve its ambitious goals in both race series, BMW M Motorsport joins its forces in terms of driver line-up. Eight BMW M works drivers will share the driving duties for BMW M Team WRT in the FIA WEC and BMW M Team RLL in the IMSA series. New to the team is Formula 1 driver Kevin Magnussen (DEN). He will be joined by Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), René Rast (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) .\n\nIn the BMW M Team WRT line-up for the FIA WEC, there is one change compared to the debut season. In the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Magnussen will start alongside Marciello and Vanthoor. The crew of car #20 remains unchanged with Frijns, Rast, and van der Linde. Wittmann continues as a regular driver in the LMDh programme but switches from the FIA WEC to the IMSA series with BMW M Team RLL. Eng stays in North America and will enter his third season with the BMW M Hybrid V8 there. Van der Linde and Vanthoor will take on a dual role, competing as regular drivers in both the FIA WEC and the full IMSA season. Vanthoor and Eng will share the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, while van der Linde and Wittmann will drive the #25 sister car.\n\nDue to scheduling conflicts between the two racing series, only two drivers per car will participate in the FIA WEC event at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) in May. Vanthoor and van der Linde will simultaneously race in the IMSA event at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nFor the endurance races of the IMSA series at Daytona, Sebring, and Road Atlanta (all USA), the other four LMDh drivers will supplement the line-ups. Magnussen will compete in all three races in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, with Marciello joining as the fourth driver at Daytona. In car #25, Frijns will drive all three races, with Rast completing the Daytona quartet.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We have high goals for the upcoming season with our BMW M Hybrid V8 prototypes. To achieve these, we are striving for optimisations in all areas. For our driver line-up, this means focusing and specialising. The more time our drivers spend behind the wheel of the BMW M Hybrid V8, the better they will get to know its handling and the more feedback they can provide to our engineers. The goal is to intensify the development of the BMW M Hybrid V8 in collaboration with the specialists at the teams and at BMW M Motorsport. It also helps us in this regard, that some drivers compete in both championships, thereby further improving the exchange of information. We are convinced that this way joining our forces will bring us advantages. Of course, the schedule overlap in May is not ideal, but we have the regulatory option to compete in a 6-hour FIA WEC race with two drivers per car, which we will utilise.

Schubert Motorsport kicked off the 2024 DTM season with their home round at Oschersleben (GER) and experienced a rollercoaster of emotions just outside their headquarters. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) finished the two eventful races on Saturday and Sunday in fourth and sixth positions, respectively. René Rast (GER) also scored points with two seventh-place finishes in both races. Marco Wittmann (GER) led the Saturday race in the closing stages, but retired just before the finish due to fuel pressure issues. On Sunday, Wittmann secured points with a tenth-place finish.\n\nThe first race on Saturday already provided fans at Oschersleben with plenty of excitement. With a tactical masterpiece, Schubert Motorsport brought Wittmann in the #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3, starting from 19th, into the lead. However, just before the end, with victory in sight, Wittmann rolled to a stop on the start-finish straight due to fuel pressure issues. Van der Linde fought in the #31 Shell BMW M4 GT3 until the finish line for a podium finish, ultimately finishing fourth with a narrow gap. Rast secured points in seventh place in the #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3.\n\nAfter a challenging qualifying session on Sunday, all three BMW M works drivers staged a comeback in the second race, moving up from the back of the field. However, van der Linde suffered an early setback when he couldn’t avoid a collision ahead of him at the start. The South African resumed the race in last place and worked his way up position by position. Eventually, he finished sixth, followed directly by Rast, who again was seventh. Wittmann completed the points positions in tenth place.\n\nIn the support programme, the ADAC GT Masters and the ADAC GT4 Germany also kicked off the 2024 season – with successes for the BMW M4 GT3 and the BMW M4 GT4. In the ADAC GT Masters, Maxime Oosten (NED) secured pole position for FK Performance Motorsport in Saturday’s qualifying. In the first race, he celebrated victory together with teammate Leon Köhler (GER) in the #54 BMW M4 GT3. In the ADAC GT4 Germany, Gabriele Piana (ITA) and Michael Schrey (GER) in the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport #2 BMW M4 GT4 secured pole position and victory in race one on Saturday. Their teammates, Leon Wassertheurer and Tim Reiter (both GER), secured third place on the podium in the #3 BMW M4 GT4. In Sunday’s qualifying, Reiter claimed pole position. Piana and Schrey celebrated their second win of the weekend in Sunday’s race.\n\nComments after the DTM season opener:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “Unfortunately, it was a rather mixed start for us in the DTM. On Saturday, thanks to a superb strategy, Marco Wittmann could have achieved a clear victory, but he unfortunately lost it due to a team error. However, Sheldon van der Linde fought for the podium until the end, and René Rast also scored points by finishing seventh in both races. Sunday’s qualifying didn’t go well, but all three fought back, and with P6, P7, and P10 in the end, we’re really satisfied. Congratulations to the successful BMW M Motorsport teams in the ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany. With pole positions, wins, and the podium, they really impressed.”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “After qualifying, I said: If we have all three cars in the top ten I'm satisfied. We achieved that on Sunday. I'm pleased that we could take these points. It’s not only important to win races, but also to collect points. We knew this weekend that the track wasn't quite optimal for us. Nevertheless, we were able to show consistent race performances with all three cars. The retirement of Marco on Saturday due to fuel issues was frustrating. Now we have to continue collecting points throughout the season, starting with the Lausitzring.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 GT3): “I think it was a really good weekend. The car didn’t really suit this track and, considering that, we had very good results with fourth and sixth. It was definitely unexpected considering where we ended up last year with basically almost not getting into the points. I am very proud of the guys, the strategy was clearly the key point in the race. At the end of race two, we jumped like five or six cars. I am generally very happy with the points this weekend.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3): “It was a challenging weekend, especially on Sunday. For some reason, we didn’t have the pace in qualifying. Still, it was seventh place in the race, just like on Saturday. We scored points twice, but, of course, that’s not what we envision. We want to fight for podiums. But we knew that Oschersleben would be a tough track for us. So we made the best out of it.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3): “It was, of course, frustrating that due to an error on Saturday, which is human, we threw away the victory and 25 points after we had taken the lead through the right call, strategy, and a bit of luck. On Sunday, nothing went right. We didn’t have the pace; the balance was very difficult. So, it was just about finishing the race, but there wasn’t really anything to gain.

On Sunday, Wittmann secured points with a tenth-place finish.\n\nThe first race on Saturday already provided fans at Oschersleben with plenty of excitement. With a tactical masterpiece, Schubert Motorsport brought Wittmann in the #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3, starting from 19th, into the lead. However, just before the end, with victory in sight, Wittmann rolled to a stop on the start-finish straight due to fuel pressure issues. Van der Linde fought in the #31 Shell BMW M4 GT3 until the finish line for a podium finish, ultimately finishing fourth with a narrow gap. Rast secured points in seventh place in the #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3.\n\nAfter a challenging qualifying session on Sunday, all three BMW M works drivers staged a comeback in the second race, moving up from the back of the field. However, van der Linde suffered an early setback when he couldn’t avoid a collision ahead of him at the start. The South African resumed the race in last place and worked his way up position by position. Eventually, he finished sixth, followed directly by Rast, who again was seventh. Wittmann completed the points positions in tenth place.\n\nIn the support programme, the ADAC GT Masters and the ADAC GT4 Germany also kicked off the 2024 season – with successes for the BMW M4 GT3 and the BMW M4 GT4. In the ADAC GT Masters, Maxime Oosten (NED) secured pole position for FK Performance Motorsport in Saturday’s qualifying. In the first race, he celebrated victory together with teammate Leon Köhler (GER) in the #54 BMW M4 GT3. In the ADAC GT4 Germany, Gabriele Piana (ITA) and Michael Schrey (GER) in the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport #2 BMW M4 GT4 secured pole position and victory in race one on Saturday. Their teammates, Leon Wassertheurer and Tim Reiter (both GER), secured third place on the podium in the #3 BMW M4 GT4. In Sunday’s qualifying, Reiter claimed pole position. Piana and Schrey celebrated their second win of the weekend in Sunday’s race.\n\nComments after the DTM season opener:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “Unfortunately, it was a rather mixed start for us in the DTM. On Saturday, thanks to a superb strategy, Marco Wittmann could have achieved a clear victory, but he unfortunately lost it due to a team error. However, Sheldon van der Linde fought for the podium until the end, and René Rast also scored points by finishing seventh in both races. Sunday’s qualifying didn’t go well, but all three fought back, and with P6, P7, and P10 in the end, we’re really satisfied. Congratulations to the successful BMW M Motorsport teams in the ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany. With pole positions, wins, and the podium, they really impressed.”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “After qualifying, I said: If we have all three cars in the top ten I'm satisfied. We achieved that on Sunday. I'm pleased that we could take these points. It’s not only important to win races, but also to collect points. We knew this weekend that the track wasn't quite optimal for us. Nevertheless, we were able to show consistent race performances with all three cars. The retirement of Marco on Saturday due to fuel issues was frustrating. Now we have to continue collecting points throughout the season, starting with the Lausitzring.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 GT3): “I think it was a really good weekend. The car didn’t really suit this track and, considering that, we had very good results with fourth and sixth. It was definitely unexpected considering where we ended up last year with basically almost not getting into the points. I am very proud of the guys, the strategy was clearly the key point in the race. At the end of race two, we jumped like five or six cars. I am generally very happy with the points this weekend.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3): “It was a challenging weekend, especially on Sunday. For some reason, we didn’t have the pace in qualifying. Still, it was seventh place in the race, just like on Saturday. We scored points twice, but, of course, that’s not what we envision. We want to fight for podiums. But we knew that Oschersleben would be a tough track for us. So we made the best out of it.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3): “It was, of course, frustrating that due to an error on Saturday, which is human, we threw away the victory and 25 points after we had taken the lead through the right call, strategy, and a bit of luck. On Sunday, nothing went right. We didn’t have the pace; the balance was very difficult. So, it was just about finishing the race, but there wasn’t really anything to gain. It was a tough weekend.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.\n\nThe credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.\n\nReturn on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.\n\nThe BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS. However, this does not mean that topics which are assessed as “not-material” are necessarily less important.\n\nWe view sustainability holistically and as a competitive advantage. That is why we disclose our sustainability performance to our investors and customers.\n\nYou will note that the implementation of ESRS requirements have contributed over 100 additional pages to our Report. Due to the company-specific materiality assessment, comparability between companies remains limited – even within the same industry.\n\nIndeed, it can be questioned how much value the additional scope and limited comparability offer to stakeholders. Accordingly, we welcome the proposed regulatory changes in the draft of the so-called Omnibus package and look forward to the draft updates and reduced scope of the ESRS.\n\nUltimately, we want added value for our stakeholders – meaning relevant and concise information. It’s not just about reporting and compliance.\n\nSLIDE: Proposed Dividend and Payout Ratio\n\nOne important element of our stakeholder orientation is our shareholder return strategy, which the BMW Group remains committed to.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 4.30 euros per share of common stock and 4.32 euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This results in a total dividend payout of 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe proposed dividend for 2024 represents a payout ratio of 36.7%. This is within our long-term strategic target range of 30-40% and notably higher than the payout ratio in 2023.\n\nOn January 2nd, we began the final tranche of our ongoing second share buyback program, which should be completed by latest April 30th. This will conclude the second program – with 2 billion euros – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nBy this point in time, we will have reduced a total of 47 million shares in circulation since the start of the share buyback authorization in 2022. This corresponds to over 7% reduction in share capital.\n\nAt the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nYou will have noted that we have made a step change in our approach since 2021. Starting in 2022, we added share buybacks as an additional instrument alongside dividend payments. We have also increasingly used the range of dividend payout corridor. And we increased the share of Automotive free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous years’ levels to almost 100% this year.\n\nSo, let’s move to the Outlook for 2025.\n\nLooking to the market development:\n\nDue to stabilizing inflation and declining interest rates in many countries, we expect to see a rise in demand.\n\nHow will the BMW Group’s sales performance develop this year?\n\nGiven the robust economic situation, we anticipate a solid market development in the US. In Europe, we do expect growth driven by electrified vehicles. The market dynamics in China, however, will remain challenging.\n\nFor the full year, revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment are expected to be in the same range as 2024.\n\nOur guidance reflects the current status of our planning, including all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th, 2025.\n\nWhat do we expect for our key performance indicators in 2025?\n\nLet me focus on selected guidance parameters.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce vehicles.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the total impact of the tariff increases in place as of March 12th amounts to approximately 1 percentage point on the Auto EBIT margin. As a result, the EBIT margin is now expected between 5 to 7%. Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.\n\nThe Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.\n\nStarting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nWe remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.\n\nTo that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.\n\nSo, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.\n\nWith the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Annual Conference 2025"}]}

And we increased the share of Automotive free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous years’ levels to almost 100% this year.\n\nSo, let’s move to the Outlook for 2025.\n\nLooking to the market development:\n\nDue to stabilizing inflation and declining interest rates in many countries, we expect to see a rise in demand.\n\nHow will the BMW Group’s sales performance develop this year?\n\nGiven the robust economic situation, we anticipate a solid market development in the US. In Europe, we do expect growth driven by electrified vehicles. The market dynamics in China, however, will remain challenging.\n\nFor the full year, revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment are expected to be in the same range as 2024.\n\nOur guidance reflects the current status of our planning, including all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th, 2025.\n\nWhat do we expect for our key performance indicators in 2025?\n\nLet me focus on selected guidance parameters.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce vehicles.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the total impact of the tariff increases in place as of March 12th amounts to approximately 1 percentage point on the Auto EBIT margin. As a result, the EBIT margin is now expected between 5 to 7%. Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.\n\nThe Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.\n\nStarting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nWe remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.\n\nTo that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.\n\nSo, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.\n\nWith the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Annual Conference 2025"}]}

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.\n\nThe credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.\n\nReturn on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.\n\nThe BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS. However, this does not mean that topics which are assessed as “not-material” are necessarily less important.\n\nWe view sustainability holistically and as a competitive advantage. That is why we disclose our sustainability performance to our investors and customers.\n\nYou will note that the implementation of ESRS requirements have contributed over 100 additional pages to our Report. Due to the company-specific materiality assessment, comparability between companies remains limited – even within the same industry.\n\nIndeed, it can be questioned how much value the additional scope and limited comparability offer to stakeholders. Accordingly, we welcome the proposed regulatory changes in the draft of the so-called Omnibus package and look forward to the draft updates and reduced scope of the ESRS.\n\nUltimately, we want added value for our stakeholders – meaning relevant and concise information. It’s not just about reporting and compliance.\n\nSLIDE: Proposed Dividend and Payout Ratio\n\nOne important element of our stakeholder orientation is our shareholder return strategy, which the BMW Group remains committed to.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 4.30 euros per share of common stock and 4.32 euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This results in a total dividend payout of 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe proposed dividend for 2024 represents a payout ratio of 36.7%. This is within our long-term strategic target range of 30-40% and notably higher than the payout ratio in 2023.\n\nOn January 2nd, we began the final tranche of our ongoing second share buyback program, which should be completed by latest April 30th. This will conclude the second program – with 2 billion euros – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nBy this point in time, we will have reduced a total of 47 million shares in circulation since the start of the share buyback authorization in 2022. This corresponds to over 7% reduction in share capital.\n\nAt the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nYou will have noted that we have made a step change in our approach since 2021.

Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.\n\nThe Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.\n\nStarting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nWe remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.\n\nTo that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.\n\nSo, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.\n\nWith the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Speech"}]}

On 23 – 25 May 2025, BMW Group Classic will host the legendary Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este in cooperation with the Villa d’Este luxury hotel. The partnership has been running for 20 years in its current form.\n\nAround 50 of the most spectacular cars of their eras will do battle in the following competition classes for the coveted prizes. Most prestigious of all is the “Trofeo BMW Group”, awarded by the high-calibre Jury to the overall winner of the Concorso d’Eleganza.\n\nClass AGlorious Excess: The Evolution of the ‘Money no Object’ Motor Car, 1920-1940\n\nClass BSculpture in Motion: The Decade of the automotive Arms Race, 1928-1938\n\nClass CRenaissance: The Post-War European Sports Car comes of Age\n\nClass D Titans of the Track: When the Boss says “Let´s race!”\n\nClass EFrozen in Time: Preservation ‘Time Capsules’ from 1900-1973 which have survived in unrestored State\n\nClass F“Go Big or Go Home”: Automotive Excess of the ‘80s to the new Millenium, when nothing seemed too fast, expensive or bold\n\nClass GVanishing act: Gone but proudly not forgotten\n\nClass HStyle matters: Opulence meets Elegance before Times change forever\n\nPrizes will also be awarded once again to spectacular concept cars from a variety of manufacturers competing in a separate class with a rich tradition.\n\nThe Concorso d’Eleganza parade on the terrace of Villa d’Este will take place in customary style on the Saturday of the event. Beyond the “Trofeo BMW Group - Best of Show” top prize, the participants and competing vehicles at the Concorso will each battle it out for victory in their individual categories, for the “Coppa d’Oro” prize awarded by Public Referendum and for an array of other distinctions such as the “Trofeo del Presidente”, which will be presented by Helmut Käs, Head of BMW Group Classic and President of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Star opera singer and BMW Group Classic brand ambassador Jonas Kaufmann will again present the “Trofeo Il Canto del Motore” for the best engine sound, as chosen by the Jury.\n\nThe Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este will provide the stage for spectacular BMW Group world premieres once more this year. The BMW brand will celebrate the premiere of an elegantly sporting one-off designed to provide motoring pleasure for two; BMW Motorrad will present a case study in unbridled adrenalin on two wheels; and BMW M GmbH will bring several high-performance models to Lake Como, including a world premiere.\n\nThe 2025 calendar contains a multitude of anniversaries that will be honoured in suitable style at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. This will be the first time that all of the still-surviving original body variants of the BMW 328 that lined up for the 1940 Mille Miglia have come together to be displayed – so it is a truly unique occurrence. The cars include the victorious BMW 328 Touring Coupé and the legendary BMW 328 “Mille Miglia” Series 1 roadster (nicknamed the “Trouser Crease Roadster”). BMW finished the race in 1st, 3rd, 5th and 6th places, and also won the prize for regularity and the team award in all classes.\n\nBMW Group Classic will bring a number of cars from its collection to Cernobbio to help mark a handful of other anniversaries. One of the headline acts in the crowd-pulling grounds of Villa Erba will be an array of different BMW 3 Series models of all generations reflecting 50 years of the 3 Series. Meanwhile, a pair of BMW icons from the 1950s – the BMW 507 and 503 – notch up their 70th birthdays this year and will be integrated across the event programme in fitting style. Not to be forgotten and likewise on the Lake Como bill will be the BMW Isetta, itself turning 70 in 2025. The 50th anniversary of the legendary BMW Art Cars will be embodied by Sandro Chia’s Art Car no. 13 (a BMW M3 GTR). Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is also celebrating a special milestone, the centenary of the launch of the very first Phantom – the pinnacle model in the marque’s portfolio.\n\nOn Sunday, 25 May, the “Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este Public Day – Il Festival” will once again give the wider public the opportunity to experience the parade of all the cars in the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. This fascinating day in the divine gardens of the nearby Villa Erba will lay on an automotive feast for all ages.\n\nThe “Amici & Automobili – Wheels & Weisswürscht” event format familiar to many from its Munich roots and now also an established fixture on the shores of Lake Como will also be part of the festival weekend in 2025.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nMunich/Berlin. The Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 will be awarded to Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. The prize honours one of the most influential contemporary artists, who will be represented in Germany for the first time with a solo exhibition. His works, which range from sculpture and installation to conceptual practice, are characterised by sharp humour, bitter seriousness, and a profound reflection on social structures. Since its launch in 2000, this prestigious award has recognised artistic positions that have had a decisive influence on contemporary art and presented them to a broad public in Berlin. BMW has been the exclusive partner of this unique initiative since 2006. The exhibition accompanying the Preis der Nationalgalerie will open at the Neue Nationalgalerie during Berlin Art Week in September 2026.\n\n“Back in 2016, Maurizio Cattelan gave a fully electric BMW i3 a spaghetti-themed wrap as part of our partnership with ‘Rencontres d’Arles’. Creative freedom has defined BMW’s cultural engagement for over 50 years, through hundreds of collaborations across the globe. And it is precisely this freedom that Cattelan continues to explore to its fullest – with wit, intelligence, and often a sharp critical edge. Whether art reflects our existence or opens up new perspectives has been discussed since the Romantic era. In Cattelan’s case, it is always both. Social relevance and creative excellence come together here, just as they do with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, which BMW has supported for two decades. We congratulate Maurizio Cattelan on being awarded the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie and on his upcoming solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate.\n\nBMW and Maurizio Cattelan collaborated at “Rencontres d’Arles” in 2016; together with photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, Cattelan created a special project based around the fully electric BMW i3. The so-called “Spaghetti Car” featured the vehicle completely covered in spaghetti-themed foil – a humorous and conceptual work that playfully addressed issues of art, consumption, and sustainability.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Maurizio Cattelan (born 1960 in Padua) has been one of the defining voices in international art. His iconic works – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin, where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.\n\nThe expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie were also eligible to submit nominations.\n\nEmma Lavigne, Sam Keller, Klaus Biesenbach say: „Nearly two decades ago, as co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.\n\nCattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion, death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.\n\nIn Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being re-examined – between the last generations with direct connections to the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives – Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures, oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and open new vantage points on contemporary social debates. In a time of increasing political polarisation, his art can encourage us to view remembrance not as compulsion or obligation, but as a vital and relevant engagement with the present and the future.\n\nCattelan’s ironic questioning of authority and “truth” carries particular urgency today. At a moment when institutions – museums, politics and the media – are re-evaluating their credibility and social roles, he scrutinizes structures of power both within and beyond the art world, always without a moralizing tone. His works provoke reflection on personal responsibility, historical representation and the limits of institutional critique and authority. In an atmosphere of political and social hardening, Cattelan’s subversive humour acts as a liberating force. He reminds us that provocation and wit are not expressions of cynicism but forms of resistance and constructive reflection. Particularly in the German context, where public discourse often carries a strong moral charge, his art opens up spaces for thought beyond outrage and polarization. Cattelan is not an artist of straightforwardness. His strength lies in embracing ambiguity, exposing contradictions and posing new questions. This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a precondition for critical awareness.\n\nThe Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the 20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”\n\nChristian Kohorst, Chairman of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie, says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of international significance to Berlin.”\n\nMaurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context. In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition. The change of location places contemporary art in dialogue with the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie and its history. The iconic hall of the Mies van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a concise, artistic setting. The exhibition is made possible by the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie.\n\nFurther information on the Preis der Nationalgalerie and its comprehensive history can be found at preis.freunde-der-nationalgalerie.de.\n\nMaurizio Cattelan, 2025:BEING AN ARTIST IS NOT A JOB, IT'S A MALFUNCTIONART IS A WAY TO SURVIVE, NOT A WAY TO LIVEIF I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED ALONGTIME AGOSOMETIMES THE BEST IDEA IS THE ONE YOU'RE TOOASHAMEDTO SAY OUT LOUDFAILURE IS MY FAVORITE COLORI DON'T MAKE ART TO COMMUNICATE, I MAKE IT TO ESCAPEIF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING SERIOUS, WEAR A CLOWN'SNOSEI DON'T BELIEVE IN INSPIRATION, I BELIEVE IN GOOD TIMING ANDBETTER EXCUSESYOU DON'T MAKE A MASTERPIECE, YOU SURVIVE ONEBEAUTY IS THE PERFECT ALIBIMY GOAL IS TO VANISH COMPLETELY, LEAVING BEHIND JUST AQUESTION MARKAS LONG AS YOU DON'T CHOOSE, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLEBEING ORIGINAL IS OVERRATED, BEING PRECISE IS TERRIFYINGGUILT IS ONE OF THE PUREST MATERIALS AN ARTIST CAN USESOMETIMES I WISH I COULD COPYRIGHT SILENCEIF I BELIEVED IN MESSAGES, I'D WORK IN ADVERTISINGI DON'T CREATE MEANING, I OFFER TRAPS FOR ITTRUTH IS NOT AN INGREDIENT, IT'S THE AFTERTASTEEVERY ARTWORK IS A LOOPHOLEYOU KNOW IT'S WORKING WHEN YOU START REGRETTING ITIF I WANTED COMFORT, I'D BUY FURNITURETHE BEST ARTWORKS ARE MISTAKES NO ONE DARED TO FIXA GOOD WORK DOESN'T ASK FOR ATTENTION, IT STEALS ITA BANANA ON A WALL IS STILL MORE HONEST THAN MOSTPEOPLE I'VE METTHE MORE YOU POLISH AN IDEA, THE LESS IT CUTSIF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, IT WASN'T ARTCONCEPTUAL ART?

The Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 will be awarded to Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. The prize honours one of the most influential contemporary artists, who will be represented in Germany for the first time with a solo exhibition. His works, which range from sculpture and installation to conceptual practice, are characterised by sharp humour, bitter seriousness, and a profound reflection on social structures. Since its launch in 2000, this prestigious award has recognised artistic positions that have had a decisive influence on contemporary art and presented them to a broad public in Berlin. BMW has been the exclusive partner of this unique initiative since 2006. The exhibition accompanying the Preis der Nationalgalerie will open at the Neue Nationalgalerie during Berlin Art Week in September 2026.\n\n“Back in 2016, Maurizio Cattelan gave a fully electric BMW i3 a spaghetti-themed wrap as part of our partnership with ‘Rencontres d’Arles’. Creative freedom has defined BMW’s cultural engagement for over 50 years, through hundreds of collaborations across the globe. And it is precisely this freedom that Cattelan continues to explore to its fullest – with wit, intelligence, and often a sharp critical edge. Whether art reflects our existence or opens up new perspectives has been discussed since the Romantic era. In Cattelan’s case, it is always both. Social relevance and creative excellence come together here, just as they do with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, which BMW has supported for two decades. We congratulate Maurizio Cattelan on being awarded the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie and on his upcoming solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate.\n\nBMW and Maurizio Cattelan collaborated at “Rencontres d’Arles” in 2016; together with photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, Cattelan created a special project based around the fully electric BMW i3. The so-called “Spaghetti Car” featured the vehicle completely covered in spaghetti-themed foil – a humorous and conceptual work that playfully addressed issues of art, consumption, and sustainability.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Maurizio Cattelan (born 1960 in Padua) has been one of the defining voices in international art. His iconic works – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin, where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.\n\nThe expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie were also eligible to submit nominations.\n\nEmma Lavigne, Sam Keller, Klaus Biesenbach say: „Nearly two decades ago, as co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.\n\nCattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion, death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.\n\nIn Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being re-examined – between the last generations with direct connections to the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives – Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures, oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and open new vantage points on contemporary social debates.

This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a precondition for critical awareness.\n\nThe Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the 20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”\n\nChristian Kohorst, Chairman of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie, says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of international significance to Berlin.”\n\nMaurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context. In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition. The change of location places contemporary art in dialogue with the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie and its history. The iconic hall of the Mies van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a concise, artistic setting. The exhibition is made possible by the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie.\n\nFurther information on the Preis der Nationalgalerie and its comprehensive history can be found at preis.freunde-der-nationalgalerie.de.\n\nMaurizio Cattelan, 2025:BEING AN ARTIST IS NOT A JOB, IT'S A MALFUNCTIONART IS A WAY TO SURVIVE, NOT A WAY TO LIVEIF I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED ALONGTIME AGOSOMETIMES THE BEST IDEA IS THE ONE YOU'RE TOOASHAMEDTO SAY OUT LOUDFAILURE IS MY FAVORITE COLORI DON'T MAKE ART TO COMMUNICATE, I MAKE IT TO ESCAPEIF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING SERIOUS, WEAR A CLOWN'SNOSEI DON'T BELIEVE IN INSPIRATION, I BELIEVE IN GOOD TIMING ANDBETTER EXCUSESYOU DON'T MAKE A MASTERPIECE, YOU SURVIVE ONEBEAUTY IS THE PERFECT ALIBIMY GOAL IS TO VANISH COMPLETELY, LEAVING BEHIND JUST AQUESTION MARKAS LONG AS YOU DON'T CHOOSE, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLEBEING ORIGINAL IS OVERRATED, BEING PRECISE IS TERRIFYINGGUILT IS ONE OF THE PUREST MATERIALS AN ARTIST CAN USESOMETIMES I WISH I COULD COPYRIGHT SILENCEIF I BELIEVED IN MESSAGES, I'D WORK IN ADVERTISINGI DON'T CREATE MEANING, I OFFER TRAPS FOR ITTRUTH IS NOT AN INGREDIENT, IT'S THE AFTERTASTEEVERY ARTWORK IS A LOOPHOLEYOU KNOW IT'S WORKING WHEN YOU START REGRETTING ITIF I WANTED COMFORT, I'D BUY FURNITURETHE BEST ARTWORKS ARE MISTAKES NO ONE DARED TO FIXA GOOD WORK DOESN'T ASK FOR ATTENTION, IT STEALS ITA BANANA ON A WALL IS STILL MORE HONEST THAN MOSTPEOPLE I'VE METTHE MORE YOU POLISH AN IDEA, THE LESS IT CUTSIF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, IT WASN'T ARTCONCEPTUAL ART?

The car was unveiled during the traditional ‘Casual Dinner’ hosted by MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports on Friday evening, with Marc Saurina, Head of Global Commercial Partnerships at Dorna Sports, and Steffi Armbruster, Head of BMW M Brand Experience, doing the honours.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red, which made its world debut in Shanghai just a few days ago, embodies an extroverted lifestyle and passion for peak performance. It combines a higher-performance M HYBRID system with individual design accents that unmistakably express its outstanding performance characteristics. A V8 engine and an electric motor integrated into the 8-speed M Steptronic transmission generate a combined system performance of 550 kW/748 hp.

In their 25th season as ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’, BMW M GmbH is continuing the tradition of providing an extraordinary highlight as the winner’s car in the BMW M Award. The fastest qualifier of the MotoGP™ 2023 will be rewarded with the flagship version of the first BMW M high-performance car with an electrified drive system: the brand-new BMW XM Label Red (combined fuel consumption: 1.7 – 1.6 l/ 100 km; combined electricity consumption: 34.5 – 33.0 kWh/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 39 – 35 g/km in the WLTP cycle; provisional values; figures for the NEDC cycle: –). The exclusive winner’s car for 2023 was officially revealed at the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez de la Frontera. The car was unveiled during the traditional ‘Casual Dinner’ hosted by MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports on Friday evening, with Marc Saurina, Head of Global Commercial Partnerships at Dorna Sports, and Steffi Armbruster, Head of BMW M Brand Experience, doing the honours.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red, which made its world debut in Shanghai just a few days ago, embodies an extroverted lifestyle and passion for peak performance. It combines a higher-performance M HYBRID system with individual design accents that unmistakably express its outstanding performance characteristics. A V8 engine and an electric motor integrated into the 8-speed M Steptronic transmission generate a combined system performance of 550 kW/748 hp. Making the BMW XM Label Red the most powerful BMW M model ever made.\n\n“In their anniversary season, BMW M GmbH is once again presenting another really breath-taking car as the winner’s car in the BMW M Award,” said Marc Saurina after the unveiling. “The BMW XM Label Red is a more than impressive vehicle, and with its performance it is the perfect embodiment of what MotoGP stands for. It is terrific that BMW M GmbH consistently emphasises the importance it attaches to the performances of our MotoGP riders. Every year the fastest qualifier is rewarded with the latest flagship in the BMW M fleet, and the BMW XM Label Red is a seamless continuation of this tradition. We are excited to see who will be able to call this extraordinary prize their own at the end of the season.”\n\n“We are delighted to present the new BMW XM Label Red as the winner’s car for the BMW M Award 2023,” said Steffi Armbruster. “Electrifying the drive system of our high-performance cars is an exciting field and the M HYBRID system of the BMW XM Label Red is an impressive testament to that. Our new flagship shows how it is possible to not only preserve the performance characteristics of BMW M models, but also to enrich them with new facets of driving pleasure at the same time. This makes the BMW XM Label Red the perfect winner’s car for the BMW M Award, in which the best motorcycle racers in the world compete to see who will be crowned the fastest overall. We are keeping our fingers crossed for everyone and are looking forward to an exciting race for the BMW M Award 2023!”\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red also takes centre stage when it comes to visuals. The powerful proportions of a dynamic Sports Activity Vehicle meet an extroverted exterior design with generous surface areas, clean lines, and a front-end design developed exclusively for luxury class BMW models. On top of this are design accents that highlight the BMW XM Label Red's individual character, which is geared to maximum performance. High-quality materials and the extravagant design have transformed the interior into an exclusive M Lounge. The BMW XM Label Red also comes with the latest BMW M driver assistance systems.\n\nThe BMW M Award has been rewarding the MotoGP™ riders who achieve the best qualifying results since 2003. Riders receive points for their positions in qualifying at each Grand Prix weekend, in line with the scoring system used for the races. The rider with the most points at the end of the season wins the coveted BMW M Award. The BMW M Award record holder is Marc Márquez, who won the award seven times in a row between 2013 and 2019.

The BMW Art Car World Tour is set to arrive in Milan at the ADI Design Museum, marking a major milestone in the celebration of five decades of artistic innovation. From 4 December 2025 to 8 January 2026, visitors will have the opportunity to experience eight iconic BMW Art Cars designed by internationally renowned artists such as Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jeff Koons. Having previously travelled to Art Basel Hong Kong, Le Mans Classic in France, the Bridge in USA, Louwman Museum in the Netherlands, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix and over 45 further stops in more than 30 countries across the globe, the BMW Art Car World Tour will conclude this year in Milan before continuing on to Rétromobile in Paris in 2026.\n\nMassimiliano Di Silvestre, President of BMW Italia says: “Celebrating 50 years of the BMW Art Cars is truly a privilege and a great emotion for us, as it allows us to express our commitment to the world of art and design, which finds the perfect setting in Italy. Having eight cars on display at the ADI Museum in Milan also means hosting the exhibition with the highest number of BMW Art Cars featured in the 2025 world anniversary tour — a strong sign of our commitment and our desire to convey the brand’s values to enthusiasts, customers, media and partners.”\n\nThe Italian leg of the Art Car World Tour kicked off at the Concorso d'Eleganza 2025, where the Sandro Chia Art Car was exhibited alongside the entire BMW Art Car miniature collection. On 29 and 30 November, the tour continues at the Nanni Nember “House of BMW Brescia”, where three legendary BMW Art Cars will be on display together with the new BMW iX3, the first model of the “Neue Klasse”. Located in the heart of Milan, a global capital of fashion and design, the ADI Design Museum will provide the perfect setting to showcase eight vehicles from the world-renowned collection to close the year:\n\nADI Design Museum The ADI Design Museum in Milan celebrates both Italian and international creativity and innovation. Since 2021, it has showcased award-winning works that have shaped the history of industrial design and aesthetics.

Accordingly, the BMW Concept F 450 GS is equipped with a fully adjustable upside-down fork and a shock absorber with load-dependent damping, drawing on technology from rally and enduro sport. Through the targeted use of lightweight construction and other state-of-the-art solutions, we can create a sensationally light vehicle close to the minimum weight requirement in the A2 class of 175 kg,\" says Marc Weber, lead engineer of the BMW Concept F 450 GS.\n\nDiverse Equipment for Safety and Comfort.Inspired by the larger sibling, the BMW R 1300 GS, the Concept F 450 GS also sets new standards in the areas of safety and functionality in its class. The relevant features range from BMW Motorrad ABS Pro (dependent on lean angle) to a performance brake, to freely configurable riding modes. With BMW Connectivity on board and the 6.5-inch TFT display, the networking of the motorcycle and smartphone as well as other accessories is enabled.\n\nA Glimpse into the Future.The question that arises when looking at the BMW Concept F 450 GS is: What could we expect in a production version? Johann Simon, vehicle project manager of the Concept F 450 GS, explains: \"No compromises for sure. Following the very sporty off-road focus of the Concept F 450 GS, we will implement the bike as close as possible to this concept. We will only adjust the seat height for better accessibility and easier handling. As an alternative to the cross-spoke wheels (19 inches front, 17 inches rear), lightweight but high-strength cast aluminium wheels in the same dimensions are also conceivable.\"\n\nBMW Motorrad plans to present the corresponding series vehicle in the style of the Concept F 450 GS in 2025."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Great results for BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT at the second round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). The 6 Hours of Imola (ITA) ended with a one-two result for the BMW M4 GT3 in the LMGT3 class. Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR) triumphed ahead of their team-mates Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA). It was the first victory for a BMW M Motorsport car in the history of the FIA WEC. BMW M Team WRT also celebrated success in the Hypercar category. After a challenging start in Qatar, Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) gave a very strong performance, battled for the podium for a long time, and ultimately finished in sixth place.\n\nThe weather conditions, with rain setting in around the halfway point of the race, turned the event into a strategy gamble. However, all BMW M Motorsport teams made the right tyre choices and were rewarded with outstanding results. The BMW M Hybrid V8 made enormous improvements compared to the season opener and was competitive under all conditions. On the wet track, final driver van der Linde even had the podium within reach, but problems during the last pit stop and a subsequent drive-through penalty pushed the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 back to a still-strong sixth place. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 with Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) in the cockpit was unlucky and got innocently involved in a collision at the start. After about an hour of repairs, the team managed to get the car back on track for important test kilometres.\n\nThe celebration was even greater in the LMGT3 category. Both BMW M4 GT3 crews continued on slick tyres as the rain began to fall, making the right decision. No competitor could match their speed, and they drove to a commanding one-two finish. Never before had a BMW M Motorsport car won a race in this series since the founding of the FIA WEC in 2012.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “That was an extremely positive FIA WEC event at Imola. In Hypercar, we made great progress after the challenging start in Qatar. We had the pace to achieve a top result on our own. I am pleased that car #20 was able to hold its own in the leading group throughout the race, even under difficult conditions. The early unprovoked accident of car #15 was very unfortunate and annoying. Many thanks to BMW M Team WRT, which rebuilt the car and sent it back on track. That allowed us to finish the race and collect important data to continue improving. On the LMGT3 side of the garage, it couldn't have gone better. Congratulations to all drivers and crew members for very strong performances. Thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and the team for a very successful weekend!”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “What a great weekend for our LMGT3 crews! Qualifying and the race went very well, and we did the little things right. Augusto and Maxime stayed on slicks on a wet track and were able to show incredible pace. That gave us a good lead and ultimately the one-two result. In Hypercar we were in the window where we belong this time after the big disappointment in Qatar. We are taking one step at a time and have already done some things very well here. On to the next race at Spa-Francorchamps.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 6th place): “In the end, that was one of the most challenging and craziest stints I've ever driven. I thought several times that I would lose the car. I knew I had to bring it home so we could score very good points. Luckily, that worked out. The team did a great job improving the car so much since Qatar. We can be very proud of that. Thank you to everyone!”\n\nMarco Wittmann (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 18th place): “That was a wild start phase, where some of our competitors quite misjudged themselves. I was hit from behind and spun around. That was very annoying. The guys did a great job repairing the car and getting us back on track. That allowed us to collect important test kilometres. My stint after the repair was great. The car felt good, and we could have made up some places. The pace and balance were good; we need to build on that. Hopefully, we'll have more racing luck next time.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “I am incredibly happy and proud. We showed today that it's about having the best team in this championship, not just the best car or the best individual driver. In my stint, the track was always differently wet, and it was a constant question of which tyres were better. We stayed on slicks the whole time, and I felt very comfortable in the BMW M4 GT3 under those conditions. The team always stayed calm and did everything right in the end. It's my son's birthday today – I couldn't have given him a better gift.”\n\nSean Gelael (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “I'm super happy! Darren qualified the car in fourth place on Saturday and drove a strong first stint. I had quite a bit of fun after that and was able to make up some time. Then I handed over to Augusto, who was sensational on the track and put pressure on Maxime. It was not so bad today.”\n\nDarren Leung (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “Winning in just my second FIA WEC race – that's just incredible! We did an outstanding job as a team. The turbulent start phase was difficult for me, but I got through it very well and was able to hand over the car in a good position to my colleagues.”\n\nMaxime Martin (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “A fantastic result for the team. We had a strong car and decided on a bold strategy. That made the difference in the end. Congratulations to the #31 crew on the victory! We collected a lot of points and will continue to work hard in the next races.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “I am very happy about the one-two for Team WRT, for BMW M Motorsport, and my first podium in FIA WEC. We already had a strong car on Saturday in qualifying, and Ahmad achieved a very good third starting position. In the race, we then decided to stay out on slicks. Augusto was a bit faster than Maxime at the beginning and took the lead. Nevertheless, I am very happy with the result.”\n\nAhmad Al Harthy (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “My first podium with Team WRT – that's an incredible feeling! Many thanks to the team, which did a fantastic job. We took a calculated risk, and it paid off in the end.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great results for BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT at the second round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC).

The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend. At the third round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the home round for BMW M Team WRT, the “6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps,” both BMW M Hybrid V8s once again demonstrated their potential following the podium finish in Imola (ITA). This time, however, it went unrewarded. The #20 Hypercar was in the fight for another podium finish until shortly before the end. A slow puncture set the car back before it had to retire for safety reasons due to a brake issue. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 also showed strong performance, but, after an eventful six hours, it was only enough for tenth place.\n\nWith perfect spring weather and an impressive crowd of nearly 100,000 spectators over the weekend, the stage was set for an exciting FIA WEC race. Each of the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars was driven by a duo instead of the usual trio. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) drove the #15, while René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) shared driving duties in the #20. Their teammates Dries Vanthoor (BEL) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) are competing this weekend with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nAt the start, Magnussen sprinted from 11th on the grid into the top five with the #15 before handing over to Marciello. In the eventful race that followed, with several safety car periods, the car, however, was set back by two drive-through penalties. Rast initially ran outside the top ten in the #20, but he and Frijns made steady progress thanks to a strong performance and good strategy. Frijns eventually pushed the BMW M Hybrid V8 into podium contention with bold moves. But half an hour before the end, he had to return to the pits due to brake problems, and the team decided not to send the car back out.\n\nEven though the race outcome did not meet expectations, BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team WRT gathered valuable data in preparation for the season highlight – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The endurance classic at the Sarthe will be held as the fourth round of the 2025 FIA WEC on 14th /15th June.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the crews of both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs had a difficult weekend. Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), who had narrowly missed out on victory in Imola with a second-place finish, came ninth in class with the Team WRT #46 car. The race ended early for the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO during the second hour. Following contact, damage occurred in the suspension area, and the trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS) had to retire.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “If you look at the race result alone, it’s obviously not what we had hoped for here at the home race for BMW M Team WRT. Also given the performance we showed with both BMW M Hybrid V8s, we had expected more in the end. It was frustrating that car number 15 received two penalties. That, unfortunately, set the car back, and it was difficult to fight for a top result after that. Car number 20 was very strong throughout the entire race. It was great to see that we were once again able to fight for top positions and were back on course for the podium. Unfortunately, we first had a slow puncture and then a brake issue that we still need to examine more closely. For safety reasons, we decided to retire the car. So, our conclusion is: the performance was there again, but, of course, we also want to achieve the corresponding results. In the LMGT3 class, the outcome was also not what we had hoped for after the strong race in Imola. Unfortunately, car number 31 retired early after contact. Car number 46 did a race without mistakes, but, unfortunately, the performance wasn’t enough today to fight for the front. We will continue working and are now looking forward to Le Mans. There, we want to show our full strength again and be at the very front.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A disappointing weekend overall. At some stages, it looked like we could fight for a podium, but, in the end, that wasn’t the case. Car #20 was forced to retire due to what looks like brake issues. We will investigate further. As for car #15, two drive-through penalties made it impossible to aim for a stronger result. Ferrari had the race under control, and there wasn’t much we could do to challenge them. In LMGT3, it was also a tough outcome. Car #31 retired early after being involved in an incident, which was very disappointing. With car #46, we maximised what we could with the pace we had, but it wasn't enough to fight for the podium. We took a strategic gamble, but, unfortunately, it didn’t pay off. We’ll analyse, we’ll learn, and we’ll come back stronger.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 10th place): “It was unfortunate to get the two drive–through penalties. Apart from that, we had a strong start to the race. We showed a decent form, but then we were just fighting to make up from the two penalties. But it has been a good effort from the whole team. The other car also showed great performance, fighting all the way up to the top. Unfortunately there was no reward.”\n\nRobin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “I think it was an exciting race overall. The start wasn’t ideal, but we recovered well and made our way forward. Our pace was decent, even though we were not the fastest in the field, but we made smart strategy calls that kept us in the mix. On my side, there was some proper racing, with elbows out! Unfortunately, we had to retire due to a brake issue towards the end, which is a real shame as a podium was definitely within reach. But that’s racing.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 9th place LMGT3 class): “We finished P9. That reflects our potential this weekend, given the pace we had. It was still a good race overall: we fought hard in the beginning of the race, we gained positions and even battled for the podium. Unfortunately, a drive-through penalty set us back, and we took a strategic gamble to try and move up the order, knowing we couldn’t gain much on outright pace. In the end, it didn’t play out in our favour. We’ll keep pushing and hope to be more competitive next time.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF LMGT3 class): “It’s disappointing to come away with zero points. The incident with Yasser was unfortunate and not how we wanted our race to end. The team always put in so much hard work and effort and I wish we could reward them. Hopefully next time, at Le Mans, we will do just that.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend.

I celebrated many great successes with Charles last season, and I've known Jordan very well since I was a teenager. Defending the title will be a big challenge, but I will do everything I can to finish on top once again in one of the most special races of the year and thus enable Jordan to do what I did a year ago: win Bathurst on my debut with BMW M Motorsport. Winning 2025 with my brother Sheldon and Augusto was one of the proudest moments of my career.\"\n\nJordan Pepper (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): \"I'm really excited and proud to be coming to Bathurst with BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT. What a place for my first works race! My memories of the race are very special. I won there in 2020 and I really enjoy the track, the place and the atmosphere. Of course, we also have pressure, because we are coming there as defending champions, but I have two great teammates in Kelvin and Charles. We get on very well on a professional and personal level.

With Raffaele and Augusto, I have two stellar teammates from whom I can learn a lot and with whom I will certainly have a lot of fun.\"\n\nMax Hesse (#89 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team KRC): \"I'm really looking forward to my debut at Bathurst.

In the heart of the Abruzzo National Park, “Stasis” – the new installation by Velasco Vitali for ARTEPARCO – has been unveiled. The project, which for the past eight years has been transforming nature into an open-air museum, introduces many innovations in its 2025 edition, including an interactive web app and a short film resulting from the collaboration between BMW Group Italia, Main Partner of the initiative, and Scuola Holden.\n\nARTEPARCO is an initiative launched in 2018 that highlights the unique landscape of the Abruzzo National Park, Lazio e Molise through contemporary art interventions. It also celebrates the synergy between culture and environmental sustainability.\n\nBMW Italia has reaffirmed its commitment to this project through 2025, supporting its evolution into a true open-air museum that guides visitors in discovering artworks situated within the heart of the Park. Recognized for its dedication to territorial enhancement, the initiative benefits from the Patronage of the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security.\n\nStarting from Pescasseroli (AQ), visitors can explore the Park’s trails, C1 and C2, and encounter works by artists with diverse stylistic backgrounds who have engaged with this pristine environment over the years, including Marcantonio, Matteo Fato, Alessandro Pavone, Sissi, Valerio Berruti, Accademia di Aracne, and megx.\n\nOn July 18th, the eighth edition of ARTEPARCO was unveiled, featuring Velasco Vitali’s “Stasis” (born in Bellano, 1960), a prominent figure in contemporary Italian art. Inspired by the Ancient Beech Forests, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the artist created a piece that pays homage to the Park’s fauna. The artwork transforms a raw oak trunk into a natural column, crowned by a depiction of an Apennine wolf—symbolizing nature and serving as a metaphor for modern society, which is still on a journey of discovery.\n\nConceived by Abruzzese entrepreneur and communicator Paride Vitale, ARTEPARCO has become a well-established event in contemporary art, with aspirations to evolve into an open museum without walls.\n\nThe initiative is promoted by BMW Italia within the framework of Corporate Citizenship, under the campaign \"SpecialMente #Drivenbypeople,\" aiming to build a robust cultural and sustainable network.\n\nIn 2025, the program introduced innovative features for visitors, including a web app accessible via arteparco.com. This digital platform allows users to explore the Park’s route and artworks through an interactive map and specially designed audio guides narrated by Victoria Cabello – Italian - British actress and television presenter – and Paride Vitale.\n\nFurthering its commitment to storytelling and social responsibility, BMW Italia partnered with the Scuola Holden to produce a documentary capturing the key moments of the “Stasis” installation.\n\nA young team from the Scuola produced an evocative long-form video that explores the main themes of the 2025 edition. This includes insights into the project's inception and the dialogue between the artist and the Park’s collaborators involved in integrating the artwork among the beech trees along the trail. The film, available on BMW Italia’s Specialmente.bmw.it website and on arteparco.com, presents the interpretation of the project through a dedicated and unique viewpoint.\n\nIn addition to the long video, the SpecialMente website features five other episodic videos that highlight the individuals involved with the Park—those who, every day, contribute with pride to its preservation and conservation. These stories are shared through communication videos published on the BMW Group Italia LinkedIn channel, showcasing the diverse efforts supporting the Park’s safeguarding.\n\nVelasco Vitali “Stasis”Inspired by the Ancient Beech Forests—designated as a UNESCO World Heritage SiteVin 2017—Vitali’s \"Stasis\" pays tribute to the Park’s wildlife. The piece references stylites, ascetics from antiquity who lived atop columns or pillars in prayer and spiritual elevation. It reflects on the concept of balance, intertwining physical and contemplative dimensions, and is connected to the artist’s \"Torre\" series, created between 2005 and 2010.\n\nThe artwork features a semi-worked, raw oak trunk transformed into a natural column, topped with an acanthus leaf-capital. At its summit stands an Apennine wolf, embodying the wildness of nature and serving as a metaphor for contemporary society’s ongoing quest for awareness and understanding. Vitali describes his vision: “For the Ancient Beech Forests of the Park, I envisioned a symbolic sculpture as a starting point for a journey where each individual leaves their mark, testifying to their bond with the land. It’s an invitation to craft a ‘geography of the mind,’ composed of connections, exchanges, and awareness of our existence.”\n\nElements of the sculpture, cast in aluminum at the historic Fonderia Artistica Battaglia in Milan, are designed to age naturally, with a patina that will develop an elegant patina over time, allowing the environment to further enhance Vitali’s work.\n\nPositioned discreetly within a secluded clearing at the end of a Park trail, \"Stasis\" harmoniously integrates into the landscape, exemplifying a meaningful synthesis of art and nature.\n\nThe BMW Group's cultural engagement, including exclusive updates and deeper insights into its worldwide cultural initiatives, can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the heart of the Abruzzo National Park, “Stasis” – the new installation by Velasco Vitali for ARTEPARCO – has been unveiled.

In the heart of the Abruzzo National Park, “Stasis” – the new installation by Velasco Vitali for ARTEPARCO – has been unveiled. The project, which for the past eight years has been transforming nature into an open-air museum, introduces many innovations in its 2025 edition, including an interactive web app and a short film resulting from the collaboration between BMW Group Italia, Main Partner of the initiative, and Scuola Holden.\n\nARTEPARCO is an initiative launched in 2018 that highlights the unique landscape of the Abruzzo National Park, Lazio e Molise through contemporary art interventions. It also celebrates the synergy between culture and environmental sustainability.\n\nBMW Italia has reaffirmed its commitment to this project through 2025, supporting its evolution into a true open-air museum that guides visitors in discovering artworks situated within the heart of the Park. Recognized for its dedication to territorial enhancement, the initiative benefits from the Patronage of the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security.\n\nStarting from Pescasseroli (AQ), visitors can explore the Park’s trails, C1 and C2, and encounter works by artists with diverse stylistic backgrounds who have engaged with this pristine environment over the years, including Marcantonio, Matteo Fato, Alessandro Pavone, Sissi, Valerio Berruti, Accademia di Aracne, and megx.\n\nOn July 18th, the eighth edition of ARTEPARCO was unveiled, featuring Velasco Vitali’s “Stasis” (born in Bellano, 1960), a prominent figure in contemporary Italian art. Inspired by the Ancient Beech Forests, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the artist created a piece that pays homage to the Park’s fauna. The artwork transforms a raw oak trunk into a natural column, crowned by a depiction of an Apennine wolf—symbolizing nature and serving as a metaphor for modern society, which is still on a journey of discovery.\n\nConceived by Abruzzese entrepreneur and communicator Paride Vitale, ARTEPARCO has become a well-established event in contemporary art, with aspirations to evolve into an open museum without walls.\n\nThe initiative is promoted by BMW Italia within the framework of Corporate Citizenship, under the campaign \"SpecialMente #Drivenbypeople,\" aiming to build a robust cultural and sustainable network.\n\nIn 2025, the program introduced innovative features for visitors, including a web app accessible via arteparco.com. This digital platform allows users to explore the Park’s route and artworks through an interactive map and specially designed audio guides narrated by Victoria Cabello – Italian - British actress and television presenter – and Paride Vitale.\n\nFurthering its commitment to storytelling and social responsibility, BMW Italia partnered with the Scuola Holden to produce a documentary capturing the key moments of the “Stasis” installation.\n\nA young team from the Scuola produced an evocative long-form video that explores the main themes of the 2025 edition. This includes insights into the project's inception and the dialogue between the artist and the Park’s collaborators involved in integrating the artwork among the beech trees along the trail. The film, available on BMW Italia’s Specialmente.bmw.it website and on arteparco.com, presents the interpretation of the project through a dedicated and unique viewpoint.\n\nIn addition to the long video, the SpecialMente website features five other episodic videos that highlight the individuals involved with the Park—those who, every day, contribute with pride to its preservation and conservation. These stories are shared through communication videos published on the BMW Group Italia LinkedIn channel, showcasing the diverse efforts supporting the Park’s safeguarding.\n\nVelasco Vitali “Stasis”Inspired by the Ancient Beech Forests—designated as a UNESCO World Heritage SiteVin 2017—Vitali’s \"Stasis\" pays tribute to the Park’s wildlife. The piece references stylites, ascetics from antiquity who lived atop columns or pillars in prayer and spiritual elevation. It reflects on the concept of balance, intertwining physical and contemplative dimensions, and is connected to the artist’s \"Torre\" series, created between 2005 and 2010.\n\nThe artwork features a semi-worked, raw oak trunk transformed into a natural column, topped with an acanthus leaf-capital. At its summit stands an Apennine wolf, embodying the wildness of nature and serving as a metaphor for contemporary society’s ongoing quest for awareness and understanding. Vitali describes his vision: “For the Ancient Beech Forests of the Park, I envisioned a symbolic sculpture as a starting point for a journey where each individual leaves their mark, testifying to their bond with the land. It’s an invitation to craft a ‘geography of the mind,’ composed of connections, exchanges, and awareness of our existence.”\n\nElements of the sculpture, cast in aluminum at the historic Fonderia Artistica Battaglia in Milan, are designed to age naturally, with a patina that will develop an elegant patina over time, allowing the environment to further enhance Vitali’s work.\n\nPositioned discreetly within a secluded clearing at the end of a Park trail, \"Stasis\" harmoniously integrates into the landscape, exemplifying a meaningful synthesis of art and nature.\n\nThe BMW Group's cultural engagement, including exclusive updates and deeper insights into its worldwide cultural initiatives, can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Corporate, Cultural Engagement"}]}

From October 9 to 13, Frieze London and Frieze Masters will return to London’s Regent’s Park. As one of Frieze’s long-term global partners since 2004, BMW will honor the artistic oeuvre of Ndebele artist Esther Mahlangu, who was the first woman to create a BMW Art Car in 1991. Together with BMW, Serpentine will reveal “Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu” (“I am because you are”), a new site-specific mural by Mahlangu in the garden at Serpentine North. In celebration of cultural exchange and responding to Mahlangu’s work, renowned actor, collector and Talk Art host Russell Tovey will curate a selection of artworks from his private collection that will be displayed at Frieze London in the BMW Lounge. He chose pieces by female, queer and artists of colour in response to works by Mahlangu. The first interview publication with Esther Mahlangu, titled “Esther Mahlangu: To Paint is in My Heart”, published by Thames & Hudson, will be launched during Frieze week with co-editors Azu Nwagbogu and Hans Ulrich Obrist.\n\nEsther Mahlangu (b. 1935, South Africa) has been creating large-scale and site-specific works for over eight decades and is a pioneer of Pan-African contemporary art. She began painting at the age of ten, learning the traditional Ndebele techniques and visual language of covering houses in bold patterns from her mother and grandmother. Mahlangu uses natural pigments mixed with clay, soil and cow dung to paint directly on the exteriors of structures in her village. Rather than using stencils and tape to achieve lines and shapes, she paints by hand with chicken feathers and an array of different brushes. The artist also works with acrylic paints on canvas, which allows her to explore different scales and a broader colour palette.\n\nIn 1991, Esther Mahlangu designed the 12th BMW Art Car in the esteemed collection, based on a BMW 525i – becoming the first woman and African artist to do so. Since 1975, artists such as Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, Cao Fei, and John Baldessari have turned BMW race and series cars into works of art. Her BMW Art Car marked the beginning of a longstanding relationship between the BMW Group and Mahlangu, inspiring future collaborations.\n\nBMW and Esther Mahlangu during Frieze London“Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu”, presented in the garden at Serpentine North in collaboration with the BMW Group and The Melrose Gallery, supported by Benjamin Milstein, is Esther Mahlangu’s first public mural in the UK. Painted over sixteen wooden panels, the work depicts traditional Ndebele shapes and patterns outlined with a black border. The title of the work translates directly from Ndebele as “I am because you are\", emphasising the importance of communities and unity among humans and other living species.\n\n“I am proud to present this monumental outdoor work at Serpentine in London. It is my wish that this painting brings much joy to those who see it in celebration and recognition of the interconnectedness that exists between our two nations and indeed all living beings”, comments the artist.\n\nBettina Korek, CEO, and Hans Ulrich Obrist, Artistic Director, Serpentine say: “Esther Mahlangu is is one of the most important artists of our time who continues to inspire emerging talents. Mahlangu is a polymath who brings art into society. This is a wonderful moment to celebrate Serpentine’s friendship with the artist and honour her work in the UK. We’re grateful to all our partners who have made this fantastic project possible and particularly BMW for their support, and we hope audiences will engage with the piece and the unique surroundings of The Royal Parks”.\n\nThe work will be officially inaugurated at the traditional Serpentine breakfast on October 9 during Frieze London.\n\nVarious events at the BMW Lounge at Frieze London will celebrate the relationship with the artist. The lounge exhibition itself salutes Esther Mahlangu’s work, showcasing a selection of the collection of renowned actor, collector and Talk Art podcast host, Russell Tovey, for the first time at Frieze London. As an admirer of the artist’s colourful abstract paintings, he chose pieces by Etel Adnan, Math Bass, Matt Connors, Jadé Fadojutimi, Mary Heilman, Carmen Herrera and Hayley Tompkins in response to Esther Mahlangu’s works “Ndebele Abstract” and “Ndebele Abstract 2022”.\n\n“Esther’s geometric work inspires me deeply, the freedom that can be found within her paintings and her practice resonates throughout my collection. Geometric abstract art has been something that I’ve gravitated towards for many years. To live with these works has felt calming and has satisfied the curiosity and enthusiasm that I long for in an image. I am so excited to bring works from my own personal collection, that bring so much to me on a daily basis, into a rich conversation with Esther Mahlangu”, says Tovey. During a talk followed by a reception on October 10 at the BMW Lounge, Russell Tovey will explain his fascination with Mahlangu.\n\nBMW is proud to enable the first interview publication with Esther Mahlangu. “Esther Mahlangu. To Paint is in My Heart” will be published by Thames & Hudson in autumn 2024 and exclusively pre-launched during Frieze London. The book explores the life and revolutionary art of Esther Mahlangu through a series of interviews between the artist and curators Hans Ulrich Obrist, Azu Nwagbogu and BMW’s head of cultural engagement, Thomas Girst as well as a foreword by Nontobeko Ntombela, curator of the Esther Mahlangu “Then I Knew I Was Good at Painting” retrospective. In addition, the South African fashion designer Thebe Magugu provides an insight into the connection between Esther Mahlangu and Ndebele culture in relation to fashion as part of the book.\n\nOn October 9, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Azu Nwagbogu and Thomas Girst will talk about their collaboration for “Esther Mahlangu. To Paint is in My Heart” at the BMW Lounge and will sign copies the book which will be on sale on site.\n\nThe year marks a pinnacle in Esther Mahlangu’s career. Besides the manifold activities during Frieze London, a retrospective of her work is touring the world: “Then I Knew I Was Good at Painting”, which opened in February 2024 at the Iziko Museums of South Africa. The exhibition showcases Esther Mahlangu's more than 50-year career and her rise as a contemporary artist, a journey that has earned her global recognition.

On October 10, contemporary Indie-Pop singer Arlo Parks will perform at the legendary KOKO Theatre in Camden. The 24-year-old artist’s most recent LP “My Soft Machine” made it into the Rolling Stone’s 100 Best Albums of 2023. Her debut album “Collapsed in Sunbeams”, released in 2021, won Parks a Mercury Prize and critical acclaim, especially for her poetic and intelligent songwriting portraying the complex reality of her contemporaries.\n\nExploring the intersection of music and the arts to spark inspiring dialogues, Frieze Music provides artists the opportunity to create a unique performance, highlighting their craft through song, inspiration and conversations with fellow artists.

The book explores the life and revolutionary art of Esther Mahlangu through a series of interviews between the artist and curators Hans Ulrich Obrist, Azu Nwagbogu and BMW’s head of cultural engagement, Thomas Girst as well as a foreword by Nontobeko Ntombela, curator of the Esther Mahlangu “Then I Knew I Was Good at Painting” retrospective. In addition, the South African fashion designer Thebe Magugu provides an insight into the connection between Esther Mahlangu and Ndebele culture in relation to fashion as part of the book.\n\nOn October 9, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Azu Nwagbogu and Thomas Girst will talk about their collaboration for “Esther Mahlangu. To Paint is in My Heart” at the BMW Lounge and will sign copies the book which will be on sale on site.\n\nThe year marks a pinnacle in Esther Mahlangu’s career. Besides the manifold activities during Frieze London, a retrospective of her work is touring the world: “Then I Knew I Was Good at Painting”, which opened in February 2024 at the Iziko Museums of South Africa. The exhibition showcases Esther Mahlangu's more than 50-year career and her rise as a contemporary artist, a journey that has earned her global recognition. As part of the show, Mahlangu's BMW 525i Art Car returned to South Africa for the first time in over 30 years. The next stop on the global tour is at the Wits Art Museum in Johannesburg, opening on November 19. Moreover, her works were part of the 2024 Venice Biennale main exhibition, “Stranieri Ovunque – Foreigners Everywhere”, curated by Adriano Pedrosa. And the latest in her remarkably versatile collaborations with the BMW Group premiered at Frieze L.A. this February: the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, featuring her artistic language and BMW's colour-change technology.\n\nFrieze MusicContinuing their long-term collaboration, BMW and Frieze will once again partner to present Frieze Music in London. On October 10, contemporary Indie-Pop singer Arlo Parks will perform at the legendary KOKO Theatre in Camden. The 24-year-old artist’s most recent LP “My Soft Machine” made it into the Rolling Stone’s 100 Best Albums of 2023. Her debut album “Collapsed in Sunbeams”, released in 2021, won Parks a Mercury Prize and critical acclaim, especially for her poetic and intelligent songwriting portraying the complex reality of her contemporaries.\n\nExploring the intersection of music and the arts to spark inspiring dialogues, Frieze Music provides artists the opportunity to create a unique performance, highlighting their craft through song, inspiration and conversations with fellow artists. Launched during the inaugural Frieze Los Angeles in 2019, the joint initiative between BMW and Frieze has brought together a wide range of musicians, including Moses Sumney, Caroline Polachek, Nilüfer Yanya and Loyle Carner.\n\nTo visit the BMW Lounge, please note that entrance tickets or VIP accreditation for the VIP day on October 9 & 10 are required.

When it comes to motorcycling, there is no such thing as weather that is too wet, too cold or too hot, it all depends on having the right outfit. BMW Motorrad took this challenge on more than 40 years ago and in 1978 was the first motorcycle manufacturer in the world to present its own complete rider equipment to complement the already established BMW Motorrad helmet. At that time the gear was still made of impregnated cowhide, but already equipped with protective zones as well as safety reflectors to increase visibility at night. This proved to be the starting signal for an unprecedented success story.\n\nIn the following decades, BMW Motorrad consistently followed its goal to make motorcycling as safe and comfortable as possible and at the same time fashionably attractive and stylish. Today it offers an unparalleled range of rider equipment surpassing all motorcycle manufacturers - always driven by the developers' urge to make existing products even better and to develop new innovative solutions to make motorcycle riding even more fun and carefree.\n\nFor the coming season, BMW Motorrad presents the Gear & Garment Collection 2023 with more than 100 new products ranging from helmets, gloves and boots to rider suits, jackets, trousers, casual wear, functional wear and accessories. Developed by motorcyclists for motorcyclists. With enthusiasm, passion and a lot of love for functional details and stylish design.\n\nBe it sports, vintage or classic design, integral or jet helmet - the selection of BMW motorcycling helmets is enormous and leaves practically nothing to be desired. For the 2023 season, the colour range has been significantly expanded for numerous models.\n\nIn addition, the new Xomo Carbon sports integral helmet proves that outstanding protection does not have to be uncomfortable. It has a carbon fibre composite shell and numerous comfortable extras such as 3D-shaped cheek pads, easy fit system for riders who wear glasses, an ergonomic visor system with soft-close function and a removable chin cover.\n\nThe \"Bowler\" helmet, like numerous other helmets now available in new additional colours, on the other hand, appeals to fashion-conscious bikers looking for a classy classic design. The retro look also features in details such as the leather applications or the inner lining with embossed BMW logo.\n\nThe \"Britz\" motorcycle goggles are a cool, stylish companion for jet helmets fans. They stand out thanks to their timeless looks, a minimalist frame design for ensuring the widest possible field of vision and anti-fog vents.\n\nThe Gear & Garment Collection 2023 also offers a wide range of suits, jackets and trousers that offers many options to meet every taste and preference. Whether racing one-piece suit, classic jacket-pants combination, leather or textile or both combined, sporty-modern, classic or vintage look - every wish is catered for.\n\nFor example, the new \"Hotlap\" jacket made of extremely fall and abrasion-resistant cowhide nappa leather superbly combines safety and comfort. Thanks to the high proportion of elastic fabrics and leather stretch inserts on the shoulders and sleeves, the jacket offers optimal freedom of movement in every riding position despite the protectors. The matching \"Hotlap\" trousers are also new and, thanks to their fit, are suitable for the seating position on roadsters as well as on sportier machines. Generous stretch inserts ensure freedom of movement.\n\nThe \"M Pro Race Comp” suitcombines sports rider requirements with a comprehensive safety package. Protectors on the shoulders, elbows, hips and knees ensure a high level of safety. While a back hump optimises aerodynamics, the BMW M Motorsport colours highlight what the eye-catching one-piece suit stands for: maximum performance.\n\nThe new “RoadCrafted 100 Years” jeans jacket combines classic looks with a high level of safety and celebrates BMW Motorrad's 100th birthday in 2023. The Special Edition features large BMW Motorrad lettering on the back and a historic BMW Motorrad logo on the sleeve. The abrasion-resistant denim fabric and NP flex protectors reduce the risk of injury.\n\nThe \"Schwabing\" jacket is also dedicated to the 100th anniversary of BMW Motorrad. With its heritage look, the Special Edition revives a classic in a new design. Traditional twin stripes and the classic BMW logo add eye-catching visual accents. NP flex protectors under the high-quality cowhide on the shoulders and elbows ensure a high level of safety.\n\nA large part of the Gear & Garment Collection 2023 is dedicated entirely to the BMW GS. The new “GS Adrar” jacket is characterised by a heritage rally feel and is optimally tailored to be used in warm temperatures and offers numerous ventilation options. The lightweight jacket features NP3 protectors on the shoulders and elbows and an NP3 back protector. The leather applications on the elbows and collar are particularly high-quality details. And matching trousers are of course also available.\n\nThe \"M Pro Race Comp\" boots meet the highest performance demands and are characterised by their large protective elements made of hard plastic. Lateral, replaceable magnesium sliders on the heel and toe of the boot prevent injuries make the boots very durable. The performance character of the boots is rounded off by the BMW M colour design.\n\nThe wind and waterproof \"Pro Race GTX\" boots stand out thanks to their modern look and various safety features. A replaceable toe slider, large-surface 3D heel guard and shin guard prevent injuries and increase durability. A large BMW Motorrad logo rounds off the design.\n\nMotorcycle-suitable materials meet fashionable design - that's what the innovative \"KnitRace\" sneakers with airy 3D knit technology are all about. The stylish sneakers are certified as motorbike boots (level 1) thanks to gear lever protection and safety features such as integrated ankle protection and 3D heel protector. They stand out due to their compactness and a BMW M colour print on the heel.\n\nThe \"Seoul GTX\" sneakers are not only good to look at. The GORE-TEX® membrane reliably protects against wind and water, while the oil and fuel-resistant sole and the integrated heel and ankle protection ensure a high level of safety. The concealed zip on the inside makes putting them on and taking them off fast and easy.\n\nWhen it comes to gloves the Gear & Garment Collection 2023 leaves nothing to be desired. The range extends from super-sporty performance gloves to design classics in vintage style as well tough hand protectors for adventurous offroad BMW GS riding.\n\nFor example, the \"GS Rallye\" gloves are the ideal companions for all off-road adventures at high temperatures. The upper section is made of air-permeable, extremely abrasion-resistant textile with large knuckle protectors making this the ideal off-road glove. The goatskin palm with zonal reinforcements also provides maximum grip.\n\nIn addition to the traditional motorcycle rider equipment, the Gear & Garment Collection 2023 also offers a wealth of functional and casual wear as well as accessories.\n\nFor example the “HighViz” vestwhich drastically improves visibility in road traffic and increases safety thanks to reflective materials and the eye-catching colour. Practical: The vest fits snugly and does not flap in the wind. It can be worn over all BMW Motorrad jackets and suits and its small pack size makes it easy to stow away.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"Quilt\" jacket, a light, woven hooded jacket with quilting and print on the front and the comfortable \"Zip-Hoodie GS\" with zip and large print on the back are ideal for wearing in the evening after a big tour.\n\nFor an overview of the 2023 Ride & Style collection, visit your BMW Motorrad homepage.\n\nIn case of queries please contact:\n\nTim Diehl-Thiele, Head of Communications BMW Motorrad\n\nJens Lemon, Head of Communications MINI and BMW Motorrad\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2021, the BMW Group sold over 2.5 million passenger vehicles and more than 194,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2021 was € 16.1 billion on revenues amounting to € 111.2 billion. As of 31 December 2021, the BMW Group had a workforce of 118,909 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. The company set the course for the future at an early stage and consistently makes sustainability and efficient resource management central to its strategic direction, from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Safe, comfortable and carefree motorcycle riding in style."}]}

Lateral, replaceable magnesium sliders on the heel and toe of the boot prevent injuries make the boots very durable. The performance character of the boots is rounded off by the BMW M colour design.\n\nThe wind and waterproof \"Pro Race GTX\" boots stand out thanks to their modern look and various safety features. A replaceable toe slider, large-surface 3D heel guard and shin guard prevent injuries and increase durability. A large BMW Motorrad logo rounds off the design.\n\nMotorcycle-suitable materials meet fashionable design - that's what the innovative \"KnitRace\" sneakers with airy 3D knit technology are all about. The stylish sneakers are certified as motorbike boots (level 1) thanks to gear lever protection and safety features such as integrated ankle protection and 3D heel protector. They stand out due to their compactness and a BMW M colour print on the heel.\n\nThe \"Seoul GTX\" sneakers are not only good to look at. The GORE-TEX® membrane reliably protects against wind and water, while the oil and fuel-resistant sole and the integrated heel and ankle protection ensure a high level of safety. The concealed zip on the inside makes putting them on and taking them off fast and easy.\n\nWhen it comes to gloves the Gear & Garment Collection 2023 leaves nothing to be desired. The range extends from super-sporty performance gloves to design classics in vintage style as well tough hand protectors for adventurous offroad BMW GS riding.\n\nFor example, the \"GS Rallye\" gloves are the ideal companions for all off-road adventures at high temperatures. The upper section is made of air-permeable, extremely abrasion-resistant textile with large knuckle protectors making this the ideal off-road glove. The goatskin palm with zonal reinforcements also provides maximum grip.\n\nIn addition to the traditional motorcycle rider equipment, the Gear & Garment Collection 2023 also offers a wealth of functional and casual wear as well as accessories.\n\nFor example the “HighViz” vestwhich drastically improves visibility in road traffic and increases safety thanks to reflective materials and the eye-catching colour. Practical: The vest fits snugly and does not flap in the wind. It can be worn over all BMW Motorrad jackets and suits and its small pack size makes it easy to stow away.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"Quilt\" jacket, a light, woven hooded jacket with quilting and print on the front and the comfortable \"Zip-Hoodie GS\" with zip and large print on the back are ideal for wearing in the evening after a big tour.\n\nFor an overview of the 2023 Ride & Style collection, visit your BMW Motorrad homepage.\n\nIn case of queries please contact:\n\nTim Diehl-Thiele, Head of Communications BMW Motorrad\n\nJens Lemon, Head of Communications MINI and BMW Motorrad\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2021, the BMW Group sold over 2.5 million passenger vehicles and more than 194,000 motorcycles worldwide.

At 5:32 p.m., it happened. With a par putt for a 73rd round, one of Germany's greatest athletes concluded an almost unbelievable success story at the Golfclub München Eichenried.

The new R 12 nineT is being presented for the \"100 years of BMW Motorrad” anniversary and is thus the successor to the R nineT, which was launched exactly ten years ago on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of BMW Motorrad.\n\nThe new BMW R 12 nineT continues 100 years of BMW Motorrad fascination and tradition seamlessly.\n\nLike the BMW R nineT in 2013, the new BMW R 12 nineT is a purist, powerful classic roadster which offers a wealth of conceptual options for almost unlimited customizing and personal individualisation.\n\nDr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: \"The R nineT and its customising concept established the new Heritage experience for BMW Motorrad's 90th birthday and has become an indispensable cornerstone of our model range. The new R 12 nineT consistently continues the successful heritage story surrounding the legendary BMW boxer engines with an even more classic, reduced design language, even greater degrees of freedom when it comes to customizing and, last but not least, new and innovative technology.”\n\nOriginal 1200 boxer engine with redesigned airbox and exhaust system delivers classic riding pleasure.\n\n100 years ago, the very first BMW motorcycle - the R 32 - was already based on the flat-twin engine. The boxer's unmistakable design, powerful acceleration, unique power delivery, hallmark sound and smooth running quickly made it a legendary synonym for BMW motorcycles. With its air/oil-cooled boxer engine, the new R 12 nineT continues this great tradition. The number 12 in the model designation refers to the engine capacity as with many models in the history of BMW Motorrad - such as the current R 18.\n\nEven more classic, purist design, great attention to detail and even more customizing options.\n\nEven more than its predecessor, the new R 12 nineT combines the beefy character of the boxer engine and the design language of traditional motorcycle eras with innovative technology and a modular concept that offers the rider a maximum of customisation options. Reduced even more to the essentials, it delivers high emotional appeal. A purist, classic look and the attention to detail were at the top of the agenda when it came to designing the bike.\n\nEdgar Heinrich, Head of Design BMW Motorrad: \"The purist design language is dominated by the clear tank/seat/rear line, in the style of the traditional /5 or the legendary R 90 S of the 70s. At first glance, the tank itself is a classic BMW boxer tank, with a typical bend in the lower edge and classic knee contact.

BMW M Motorsport will be represented with a large contingent of teams, drivers, and cars in the 2025 GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS season. ROWE Racing and Team WRT will deploy BMW M works drivers. Additionally, customer teams Ceccato Racing, Century Motorsport, and Paradine Competition will take on the challenge in one of the world's most competitive GT racing series .\n\nIn the Endurance Cup, an impressive number of eight BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will compete in the entire season consisting of five races. ROWE Racing, in car #98, will feature the BMW M works driver trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI). Also, three works drivers will pilot the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO for Team WRT: Ugo de Wilde (BEL), Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), and Charles Weerts (BEL). Jens Klingmann (GER), as the seventh works driver, will participate in the full season, sharing the cockpit of the AlManar Racing by Team WRT #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO with Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) and Ben Tuck (GBR). WRT’s car #30 will be driven by Gustav Bergström (SWE), Gilles Stadsbader (BEL), and Etienne Cheli (FRA). Additional entries in the Endurance Cup include teams Ceccato Racing and Century Motorsport with one car each, and Paradine Competition with two BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars. In one of these cars, Darren Leung (GBR) will receive support from BMW M works drivers, mainly Dan Harper (GBR), who, however, will not be able to compete in all races due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nIn the Sprint Cup, five BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will compete in all five race events, three from Team WRT and two from Paradine Competition. Kelvin van der Linde and Weerts, Klingmann and Al Zubair, as well as Bergström and Stadsbader are the WRT drivers participating in both cups, competing for points and titles in the overall GT World Europe standings. In the Sprint Cup, Leung will also have a works driver – again mainly Harper – by his side.\n\nLast season, six GT World Europe titles went to BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers. Team WRT won the overall team standings as well as the team standings in the Sprint Cup. The driver champion in the Silver Cup was Calan Williams (AUS), with the team title also going to WRT. In the Bronze Cup, Paradine Competition triumphed, as did the driver duo Harper/Leung in both the team and driver standings.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “It will be fantastic to see so many BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars on the starting grid of the GT World Challenge Europe. We have very strong pro crews with which we aim to compete for overall victories and titles. Additionally, there are pleasingly many customer teams taking on the challenge in one of the strongest GT racing series in the world and also aiming for titles in all classes. In its first races this season in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, our BMW M4 GT3 EVO immediately achieved victories and demonstrated its enormous potential. Hopefully, many more will follow throughout the season.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am proud of the impressive line-up of BMW M Motorsport customer teams and drivers in the GT World Challenge Europe. We won several titles in different classes in 2024. We aim to build on this record and ideally even expand it.

Additionally, there are pleasingly many customer teams taking on the challenge in one of the strongest GT racing series in the world and also aiming for titles in all classes. In its first races this season in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, our BMW M4 GT3 EVO immediately achieved victories and demonstrated its enormous potential. Hopefully, many more will follow throughout the season.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am proud of the impressive line-up of BMW M Motorsport customer teams and drivers in the GT World Challenge Europe. We won several titles in different classes in 2024. We aim to build on this record and ideally even expand it. I can't wait to walk through the paddock and see the large number of BMW M Motorsport cars. This applies to the BMW M4 GT3 EVO as well as to the BMW M4 GT4 EVO, which we will see in the GT4 European Series.”\n\nThe GT World Europe line-ups at a glance:\n\n#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\n#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing:\n\n#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT:\n\n#30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\n#991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition\n\n#992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition\n\n#15 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, BMW Italia Ceccato Racing:\n\n#42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Century Motorsport:\n\n#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\n#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT:\n\n#30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\n#991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition\n\n#992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The installation is inspired by the new BMW i5 and is a unique combination of art and technology that uses AI in a responsible manner to create an immersive on-site art experience. The 100% electric BMW i5 transforms into a dynamic canvas of distinct generative art and features works by contemporary artists Esther Mahlangu, Kohei Nawa, Eric N.

After training a base model to represent art in general, StyleGAN is further trained on works from the participating contemporary artists. “We wanted to explore what happens when an AI image-generation model encounters works by specific artists; how do the results change when different parameters of the algorithm are modified and how can we use that to create animations that evoke the essential feeling of a particular artist’s work,” asks Nathan Shipley. “We see experiments like this as part of a fascinating early conversation about ways that AI can be used in art-making.”\n\nThis human-machine art installation brings forth a distinct convergence of innovation and creativity.

BMW M Team WRT has started the 2024 season of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS Sprint Cup with a victory. Dries Vanthoor and Charles Weerts (both BEL) won the first of two races held on Sunday at Brands Hatch (GBR) in the #32 BMW M4 GT3. Their teammates, Valentino Rossi (ITA) and Maxime Martin (BEL), who are participating in individual starts in the Sprint Cup with the #46 BMW M4 GT3, were unrewarded for their strong performances.\n\nStarting from third place, Vanthoor brought the #32 car up to second before the driver change. With a perfect and swift pit stop, BMW M Team WRT ensured that Weerts returned to the track as the leader. After an hour of racing, the team celebrated a well-deserved victory for Vanthoor and Weerts. Rossi/Martin finished fifth but dropped to 15th due to a time penalty.\n\nIn the second race, Martin and Rossi managed to climb up to a temporary sixth from 11th on the grid. However, a few minutes before the end, while lying in P8, Rossi reported steering issues and had to head into the pits. Weerts and Vanthoor, starting tenth, crossed the finish line in seventh.\n\nIn the Silver Cup, Team WRT’s #30 BMW M4 GT3 was successful: Sam De Haan (GBR) and Calan Williams (AUS) finished the two races in second and third positions in the class, respectively, securing podiums in their category.\n\nReactions after the races at Brands Hatch:\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “It’s a great way to start the Sprint Cup season with a win here at Brands Hatch. Dries did a great job to take P2 after a few laps and then the pit crew did an excellent job, they were one and a half seconds quicker than anybody else, which brought us to P1 and Charles finished the job in the best way. It was a pity for the number 46 car of Valentino and Maxime. They were in P5 at the end of race one, but got a penalty for speeding in the pit lane. In race two, unfortunately an issue stopped them after they had put in a strong chase through the field. But they also did a great job.”\n\nDries Vanthoor, #32 BMW M4 GT3: “The first lap of race one was very interesting. I gained a position and then lost it again. So I tried to hunt down the Ferrari in front of me. It was difficult, I just tried to make no mistakes and to drive as fast as I could. It was crucial to stay as close to P1 as possible. Then the boys did an amazing pit stop and Charles did a great job to keep P1 and the win. Race two was a bit more difficult as we started from tenth. Finishing seventh was the best we could do. Now I’m looking forward to the next race.”\n\nCharles Weerts, #32 BMW M4 GT3: “Dries did a great job qualifying us in third for race one. Then he had a very good start to the race. When we came to the pit stop, the guys in the pits did an amazing job – as we are used to from them. So we were able to take the lead in the pit, which was crucial in a way as it would have been very, very difficult to do so on track. So they played a very big part in this victory. It has been a great start to the season and that win will give us momentum for the next rounds.”\n\nMaxime Martin, #46 BMW M4 GT3: “It’s not been the weekend we were expecting, but it’s always nice to come here and race on an old school track. It was still a very positive weekend for the team, as they had a victory with the sister car. We had some good fights and good fun. Let’s see what Misano brings!”\n\nValentino Rossi, #46 BMW M4 GT3: “I got my first podium with the BMW M4 GT3 here at Brands Hatch, but this time it was more difficult! Yesterday we suffered a lot but today it was better. Unfortunately, I had a problem with the steering in the second race, where I had to retire and we also had a penalty for speeding in the pit lane in race one. Anyway we suffered more than we expected, but it was still a pleasure to race at Brands Hatch! Let’s see what we can do in Misano!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Team WRT has started the 2024 season of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS Sprint Cup with a victory.

However, a few minutes before the end, while lying in P8, Rossi reported steering issues and had to head into the pits. Weerts and Vanthoor, starting tenth, crossed the finish line in seventh.\n\nIn the Silver Cup, Team WRT’s #30 BMW M4 GT3 was successful: Sam De Haan (GBR) and Calan Williams (AUS) finished the two races in second and third positions in the class, respectively, securing podiums in their category.\n\nReactions after the races at Brands Hatch:\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “It’s a great way to start the Sprint Cup season with a win here at Brands Hatch. Dries did a great job to take P2 after a few laps and then the pit crew did an excellent job, they were one and a half seconds quicker than anybody else, which brought us to P1 and Charles finished the job in the best way. It was a pity for the number 46 car of Valentino and Maxime. They were in P5 at the end of race one, but got a penalty for speeding in the pit lane. In race two, unfortunately an issue stopped them after they had put in a strong chase through the field. But they also did a great job.”\n\nDries Vanthoor, #32 BMW M4 GT3: “The first lap of race one was very interesting. I gained a position and then lost it again. So I tried to hunt down the Ferrari in front of me. It was difficult, I just tried to make no mistakes and to drive as fast as I could. It was crucial to stay as close to P1 as possible. Then the boys did an amazing pit stop and Charles did a great job to keep P1 and the win. Race two was a bit more difficult as we started from tenth. Finishing seventh was the best we could do. Now I’m looking forward to the next race.”\n\nCharles Weerts, #32 BMW M4 GT3: “Dries did a great job qualifying us in third for race one. Then he had a very good start to the race. When we came to the pit stop, the guys in the pits did an amazing job – as we are used to from them. So we were able to take the lead in the pit, which was crucial in a way as it would have been very, very difficult to do so on track. So they played a very big part in this victory. It has been a great start to the season and that win will give us momentum for the next rounds.”\n\nMaxime Martin, #46 BMW M4 GT3: “It’s not been the weekend we were expecting, but it’s always nice to come here and race on an old school track. It was still a very positive weekend for the team, as they had a victory with the sister car. We had some good fights and good fun. Let’s see what Misano brings!”\n\nValentino Rossi, #46 BMW M4 GT3: “I got my first podium with the BMW M4 GT3 here at Brands Hatch, but this time it was more difficult! Yesterday we suffered a lot but today it was better. Unfortunately, I had a problem with the steering in the second race, where I had to retire and we also had a penalty for speeding in the pit lane in race one. Anyway we suffered more than we expected, but it was still a pleasure to race at Brands Hatch! Let’s see what we can do in Misano!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GT World Challenge Europe: BMW M Team WRT kicks off 2024 Sprint Cup season with a victory."}]}

Focused uncompromisingly on riding dynamics, it delivers a far sportier experience than its predecessor thanks to a completely redesigned engine and chassis, while still retaining core BMW values such as touring capability and comfort.\"Christof Lischka, Head of Development BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R: the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is noticeably sportier both technically and visually, featuring dynamic styling for an aggressive, athletic design. Four attractive model variants.\n\nThe goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 R was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the dynamic roadster with boxer engine. Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 R remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 1300 R is offered in Snapper Rocks metallic, with additional variants including the Exclusive variant in Racing blue metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium Option 719 Kilauea in Blackstorm metallic.\n\nSporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun and touring comfort.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 R significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new BMW R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. Optional Comfort handlebars are also available.\n\nA range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height, while a newly developed luggage system with electrified cases and a clever tank bag makes the bike ideal for comfortable touring and holiday trips.\n\nFor many years, BMW’s roadsters with boxer engine have enjoyed an excellent reputation among female customers and restarters in particular. This is thanks to their good accessibility and low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 R again placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of well below 790 mm. In addition to the standard seat, several others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor touring and holiday rides, the new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with a newly developed case system and case holders from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment ex works. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 R has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 R has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 R can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 R has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 R has also been redesigned.

Focused uncompromisingly on riding dynamics, it delivers a far sportier experience than its predecessor thanks to a completely redesigned engine and chassis, while still retaining core BMW values such as touring capability and comfort.\"Christof Lischka, Head of Development BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R: the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is noticeably sportier both technically and visually, featuring dynamic styling for an aggressive, athletic design. Four attractive model variants.\n\nThe goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 R was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the dynamic roadster with boxer engine. Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 R remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 1300 R is offered in Snapper Rocks metallic, with additional variants including the Exclusive variant in Racing blue metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium Option 719 Kilauea in Blackstorm metallic.\n\nSporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun and touring comfort.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 R significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new BMW R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. Optional Comfort handlebars are also available.\n\nA range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height, while a newly developed luggage system with electrified cases and a clever tank bag makes the bike ideal for comfortable touring and holiday trips.\n\nFor many years, BMW’s roadsters with boxer engine have enjoyed an excellent reputation among female customers and restarters in particular. This is thanks to their good accessibility and low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 R again placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of well below 790 mm. In addition to the standard seat, several others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor touring and holiday rides, the new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with a newly developed case system and case holders from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment ex works. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 R has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 R has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 R can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 R has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm.

In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 R has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 R also features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels. The reduced rotational masses result in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimised handling qualities.\n\nNew electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA), with dynamic adjustment of the damping, spring rate and load compensation as optional equipment. The world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.\n\nWith its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear, the standard electronic Dynamic ESA itself offers a high level of riding safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. This makes the new BMW R 1300 R the first series production motorcycle with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring rest. With DSA, the rider benefits from even more refined handling and increased banking freedom.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 R comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nStandard full LED headlight in dynamic octagonal design and state-of-the-art LED lighting throughout. Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 R comes as standard with a newly designed LED headlight in a dynamic octagonal shape, featuring a distinctive light icon.\n\nWith the optional Adaptive Turning Light, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimised for cornering, depending on the banking position, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimising the light pattern, the dipped beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW) for safe and comfortable motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R can be equipped with the Riding Assistant for even safer and more comfortable motorcycling. This includes Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW).\n\nFor the first time, navigation preparation now features electric unlocking for maximum operating comfort as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThis item of ex works optional equipment allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a mount cradle. For the first time, this holder no longer requires a key – it unlocks electrically for maximum convenience.\n\nOptional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nAn extensive program of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW R 1300 R:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Kit"}]}

The purist design and the all-electric drivetrain of the new MINI Cooper are consistently geared towards urban driving fun, highlighting the exceptional status of the MINI within its vehicle segment. There is virtually no other vehicle model in the world that has succeeded in accentuating its own history and tradition based on evolutionary advancements while at the same time repeatedly setting new technical standards over a period of more than 60 years of construction. What has remained is the underlying notion of a vehicle that offers the greatest possible space utilisation for passengers despite compact external dimensions. New features include the world of digital experiences, modern assistance systems and a purely electric powertrain that guarantees locally emission-free mobility. As such, the fifth generation is a typical MINI while at the same time symbolising the brand’s all-electric future.\n\n“With its electric drive and purist design, the new MINI Cooper is a perfect fit for an urban lifestyle. In the fifth generation of the MINI Cooper, we combine the traditional MINI DNA with innovative, future-oriented technology while enabling locally emission-free driving fun that is typical of MINI,” says Stefanie Wurst, Head of MINI.\n\nCharismatic Simplicity: the new MINI design style.The design of the new MINI model generation is modern, digital and unmistakable. With the new MINI family, the brand takes driving fun, the user experience and a responsible attitude forward into a new era. This comprehensive transformation on the way to becoming an all-electric brand by 2030 is reflected in the authentic design of the new models, combining forward-looking technology with the elementary principles of body design and the brand’s origins. In doing so, it emphasises the urban character of the MINI along with the sheer joy of innovation.\n\n“Inspired by our history, we have developed our own new design language, defining our DNA. We call it ‘Charismatic Simplicity’. The idea behind it is a design that gives each new MINI model a strong, individual character and is characterized by a clear, reduced design language intuitively focused on the essentials of the brand.” says Oliver Heilmer, Head of MINI Design.\n\nThe exterior: maximum reduction to the essentials.In the new model generation once again, the MINI 3-door embodies the core of the brand. With its fully electric drivetrain, the new MINI Cooper is consistently geared towards urban driving fun, transporting the character of the iconic model into the brand’s purely electric future.\n\nThe agile and compact silhouette features hallmark MINI proportions: short overhangs, a short bonnet and the contrasting long wheelbase with large wheels give the fifth model generation of the MINI Cooper a fascinating charisma with classic design features. At the same time, this emphasises the athletic impression and underlines the model’s contemporary urban orientation.\n\nDetails such as the flush door handles and the absence of fender flares and classic side scuttles support the modern design of the exterior by giving the surfaces a striking clarity. This reduction to the essentials places even more emphasis on the body paint finish on the larger body surface. In this way, typical MINI design features such as the visual three-part division of the vehicle body, the all-round window area and the contrasting roof have a greater impact, helping the new design style to take effect.\n\nStriking face with fresh radiance: MINI LED-lights with Signature Modes.In the new model generation, the front end of the all-electric MINI Cooper is once again characterised by the iconic MINI circular headlights and the striking grille. These go together to create the hallmark MINI appearance. The new octagonal front grille with its filigree contour defines the front section even more powerfully than its hexagonal predecessor. Instead of chrome, the new accent colour Vibrant Silver adds highlights to the exterior, giving the new MINI Cooper an even more expressive appearance.\n\nThe daytime running light elements of theLED-lights support this striking look with fresh radiance due to unique light signatures. Horizontal light graphics are part of the Essential Trim. Optionally, the daytime running light elements can be switched to create three adjustable light signatures, thereby emphasising the distinctive character of each vehicle. In addition, all light modes start and end with a specially orchestrated welcome and goodbye animation. This interaction with the MINI Cooper heightens the sense of anticipation for the MINI even before you set off.\n\nReduced details for a powerful presence and increased dynamic performance. As with the body design as a whole, the front headlights are not framed with chrome elements anymore. This results in the front section having a focused expression. Together with the fascinating curves of the bonnet and the clear-cut design of the front apron, the new MINI 3-door has a distinct and sporty look. This impression is supported by the vehicle’s track width and the dynamic indentation at the wheel arches.\n\nThe side view of the new MINI Cooper also conveys greater reduction and clarity. For the first time, the model appears without a circumferential Black Band. Reducing the number of components places the body colour more at the centre of interest, thereby ensuring a powerful presence. Black sills visually move the MINI Cooper closer to the road. The vehicle combines a modern take on the hallmark MINI design with outstanding aerodynamic properties. The cd figure of 0.28 is outstanding for the small car segment and makes the MINI extremely efficient.\n\nThe new MINI aesthetic also gives the rear section a new, contemporary feel, featuring clear surfaces and flush rear lights. The vertical light clusters quote the classic MINI lights and can be switched to different modes in the same way as the front headlights. The third brake light and rear fog light are integrated flush into the rear design, emphasising the high quality of the sculptured modern rear section. A defined shoulder section gives the MINI Cooper a particularly powerful look. A striking black handle strip divides the rear section, its horizontal orientation highlighting the vehicle’s broad stance and the sporty flair that this conveys.\n\nFour individual trims for even more character.The all-electric MINI Cooper is available in four different trims. The Essential Trim presents maximum clarity and a reduced overall appearance, highlighting certain functional parts such as the logo in the new colour Vibrant Silver. The new range of external paint finishes underlines the modernity of the new MINI icon and sets positive accentuations with bright tones such as Sunny Side Yellow.\n\nWhile the Classic Trim primarily applies to the interior, the Favoured Trim features particularly expressive details on the exterior. This trim variant offers the new, optional Spray-Tech design of the characteristic Multitone Roof with a combination of three different colours as well as a front grille in Vibrant Silver.\n\nThe John Cooper Works Trim lends maximum emphasis to the sporty flair of the all-electric MINI Cooper with a distinctive front and rear design. The frame of the front grille and the logo in high-gloss black underline the powerful overall look, while a contrasting roof in Chili Red – inspired by motor sport – and JCW-specific bonnet stripes in red or black optionally lend visual emphasis to the driving dynamics typical of MINI.\n\nThe interior: minimalist, digital, immersive & warm.On the inside, the design of the front area echoes the famous minimalist design of the classic Mini. For the first model in 1959, Mini inventor Alec Issigonis designed an interior with a round instrument cluster in the centre and the characteristic toggle bar below. In the new MINI Cooper, it is precisely these two elements, in combination with the steering wheel, that structure the interior with its maximum purist design. Reducing everything to the essentials, the new interior makes do with a smaller number of components that are cleverly designed and implemented to a high standard. Behind the steering wheel, the optional head-up display ensures that all the relevant content appears in the driver’s field of vision. As a result, the dashboard on the driver’s side does not require an additional display, so it opens up the view to the front.\n\nThe amply sized, curved dashboard features textile surfaces for the first time. Warm, pleasant materials characterise the new, homely feel-good atmosphere in the interior of the MINI Cooper. A specially developed knitting process is used to create the versatile, easy-care structure of the textile in two-colour design made of recycled polyester. There is a choice of different colours for the textile surfaces and seats depending on the trim design. To make the dashboard as slim and spacious as possible, the air vents are very flat.\n\nThe clear lines and generous space in the front seats give the interior a modern, airy feel, while the optional panoramic glass roof makes the interior particularly bright and friendly. In the dark, the side lighting is based on the ambient light, thereby contributing to a distinctive interior atmosphere. The seats are available in a basic version and in a JCW version, with side panels that are laminated with high-quality textile covering the adjustment buttons. The armrest, mounted on the driver’s seat, provides even more space in the centre console. The rear of the vehicle offers maximum reduction and comfort, while the loading accessories can be conveniently stowed in an additional underfloor storage facility in the luggage compartment. By folding down the rear seat in a 60:40 ratio, the luggage compartment can be flexibly expanded from 200 litres to provide a volume of up to 800 litres.\n\nMINI Interaction Unit: High-Res OLED display revolutionises the user experience.The central OLED display sets a new benchmark with its high resolution. Like the round instrument in the predecessor model, the new centre icon is the defining feature of the interior with its versatile functions. As an instrument cluster, the MINI Interaction Unit is a centre of both experience and comfort. Thanks to MINI Operating System 9, all vehicle functions can be operated intuitively with touch or voice control. The display in the redesigned cockpit has been moved closer to the driver so it is particularly convenient to reach. The diameter of the thin touch display with a high-quality glass edge has grown to 240 mm. Its operating logic is reminiscent of the standards familiar from smartphones.\n\nThe graphic presentation of the content is modern and focuses on the essentials. The upper area contains relevant vehicle-related information such as speed and battery status. When the speed indicator is pressed, a large, striking display with full-screen speedometer appears that puts a clear focus on driving. In the Home menu, the other widgets are displayed in thumbnail view to the left and right of the current menu function. They can be brought up and selected by swiping horizontally to the centre. In the lower area of the OLED display, the menu items Navigation, Media, Phone and Climate can be selected directly at any time. All other functions can be accessed via the menu in the same way as on a smartphone. The display returns to the default setting via the home button.\n\nA whole new MINI experience: the new MINI Experience Modes. The MINI Experience Modes, Core, Green and Go-Kart, each with their specific user interface design, are available as standard, with up to four additional modes available with the MINI Experience Modes optional equipment. The optional MINI projector on the back of the OLED display immerses the dashboard in matching colour schemes and patterns. The interplay of projection, ambient lighting and the MINI Interaction Unit results in a unique, immersive experience that extends into the door panels.\n\nThis immersive user experience makes the interior even more expressive based on new solutions, thereby giving rise to entirely new individualisation options in the new MINI Cooper. In Personal Mode, for example, an individually selected image can be set as the display background via the MINI App. The dominant colours of the image then extend across the textile dashboard surfaces by means of a digital colour picker. The ambient lighting under the dashboard and in the door mirror is also colour-coded to match these projections.\n\nEach mode has specially designed backgrounds that convey a vibrant and high-quality effect by means of subtle movements while remaining as distraction-free as possible. When one of the seven modes is selected, the display focuses on a relevant “Mode App”. In Go-Kart Mode there is a highly dynamic focus on MINI’s racing DNA, for example. The display and the interior as a whole feature the colours anthracite and red, while specific analogue displays for driving dynamics complement this MINI Experience Mode inspired by John Cooper Works. Vivid Mode draws on the colours of the album cover for the ambient lighting. Core Mode, Green Mode, Timeless Mode, Balance Mode and Personal Mode are also available for selection according to mood and personal needs.\n\nSimply typical MINI: the redesigned toggle bar.Underneath the dashboard, the design of the new MINI Cooper is particularly clean in appearance. One of the key factors here is the newly designed toggle bar. Here, the most important driving functions (parking brake, gear selector, start/stop key, experience mode toggle, volume control) are directly accessible. Its design is individua in accordance with its function.\n\nThe direct selection options on the toggle bar eliminate the need for a gearshift, so the new MINI Cooper offers more storage space in the centre console. In addition to the enlarged cup holders, there is also a large open storage compartment. The storage box with a knitted surface and a textile strap comes as standard with the Favoured Trim. Smartphones can be charged in the wireless charging area at the front of the console and are easier to find thanks to the central storage area.\n\nFour newly designed trims for an individual look.In line with the consistent reduction in the interior, the new contemporary colour and material concept is deliberately minimalist, too. Only newly developed, high-quality and environment-friendly materials are used. The dashboard and door panels with knitted surfaces made of recycled polyester create a pleasant atmosphere while at the same time setting specific accentuations with their two-tone design. Four newly designed trims convey differing versions of the modern feel-good concept in the interior. From Classic Trim onwards, the two-spoke basic steering wheel is replaced as a three-spoke version with a new textile strap in the six o'clock spoke.\n\nThe Essential Trim features an interior of maximum clarity and reduction. Black sports seats with distinctly patterned multitone textile harmonise with a coloured textile band on the dashboard. Certain functional parts on the inside and outside are highlighted with the new accent colour Vibrant Silver. On the exterior, for example, the logo appears in the new colour, contrasting sharply with the black, octagonal front grille.\n\nIn the Classic Trim, MINI uses a modern 2D knitted textile in the interior of a production vehicle for the first time. On the dashboard and door handles, two-tone black knitted textile provides a fascinating contrast to the high-quality synthetic leather seat. It is available in grey and black featuring a perforated houndstooth pattern, while the side contrasts in blue textile.\n\nThe modern, high-quality Favoured Trim is the most expressive option, featuring a two-tone houndstooth pattern on the knitted-textile instrument panel. Available in two colours and with traditional accent stitching, the perforated Vescin sports seats complement this extravagant interior in dark and light. The exterior with the front grille in Vibrant Silver can be combined in a particularly apt way with the all-new Spray-Tech roof which features a blending of three different colours.\n\nThe JCW Trim offers the sportiest interpretation of the new material concept. Combined with multi-coloured knitted textile and black synthetic leather with red stitching, the JCW seat with sports seat geometry echoes the colour concept of the dashboard and door trim. A distinct front and rear design likewise highlights the racing DNA of the trim in the exterior, with the vehicle grille and logo in high-gloss black underlining the powerful overall impression. Optional features include a contrasting Chili Red roof and JCW-specific red or black bonnet stripes.\n\n“Hey MINI!”: the first MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant.In the new MINI Cooper, numerous functions can be controlled using the brand’s first ever fully-fledged voice assistant. The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated with the greeting “Hey MINI” or by using the push-to-talk steering wheel button. Voice-controlled interaction takes place on the round OLED display in the form of an animation of graphic elements, typography and an avatar. For the visualisation, users have the option to choose between “MINI” – a stylised representation of a MINI – or optionally \"Spike\" already familiar to many MINI fans. Communication with this virtual travel companion is particularly true-to-life thanks to improved voice recognition. In order to ensure smoother communication, oral utterances are transmitted instantly and visualised on the display. In this way, the driver can control navigation, telephony, entertainment and numerous other vehicle functions by acclamation.\n\nDuring the dialogue between customer and vehicle, the MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant continuously learns on repetitive routes. Drawing on geo-based data, for example, the vehicle can learn to automatically open the window when entering a car park. This makes day-to-day routines more convenient and personal.\n\nMINI connects: the new MINI Operating System 9. The new “Charismatic Simplicity” design language is also reflected in the aesthetic of the user interface, which brings together functional and emotional elements. The reduced design uses all-new graphics to create an extremely modern look. Static and dynamic elements blend naturally into the circular form of the OLED display, following a clear structure. Micro-animations enhance the already extremely intuitive interaction between the driver and central instrument and underscore the digital character of the new MINI family.\n\nMINI Operating System 9 is an in-house development by the BMW Group and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. Operation is intuitive and follows the standards familiar from consumer electronics.\n\nAt the centre of the screen is the start menu, where personalised content can be selected and launched by swiping to the side. In the lower section of the screen is the fixed status bar containing the menu items “Navigation”, “Media”, “Telephony”, “All Apps” and, depending on the situation, “Home”, which can be selected directly. Swiping up from the lower edge of the screen reveals a tool belt, a process customers will be familiar with from many consumer electronics devices. Favourite functions can be stored here and called up again rapidly, i. e. navigation destinations and radio stations. The tool belt can also be activated via the star button on the multifunction steering wheel. The upper screen area is reserved for driving-relevant content such as the vehicle speed and important information on the vehicle status. The optional Head-up display shows the most important information for the driver in their field of view.\n\nThe temperature for the driver and front passenger is permanently displayed on the left- and right-hand edge of the screen. The climate control settings are integrated into the MINI Interaction Unit and can always be adjusted on the top layer by touch or voice command.\n\nDepending on the Experience Mode selected, a single tap on the speed display transforms the entire MINI Interaction Unit into a MINI-typical speedometer.\n\n“The new MINI Operating System 9 is characterised by simple, emotional touch operation that is specific to MINI. Together with the new cloud-based MINI Navigation for particularly precise and fast route calculation, high-speed connectivity and optional 5G capability, the new MINI Cooper takes a giant leap into the digital world, thereby underlining the brand’s charismatic heritage,” says Stefanie Wurst, Head of MINI.\n\nWhen driving, the complete MINI Navigation Package in conjunction with the optional MINI Connected Package provides support in the form of realistic 3D visualisations in complicated turning situations, display of the current traffic situation even without activated route guidance, information on parking options including digital payment options and much more. In addition, an optional augmented reality function is available for the visualisation of turn-by-turn directions. A charge-optimised route can be calculated for the all-electric MINI Cooper immediately after entering the destination.\n\nIn addition, MINI Connected Upgrades allow flexible bookings of additional vehicle functions – simply digital. In conjunction with the optionally available MINI Connected Package, the MINI Connected Store provides access to a constantly evolving variety of practical and entertaining apps, including gaming, music and video streaming. The new AirConsole app provides a unique form of in-car gaming for all passengers, making the smartphone the controller of the game on the OLED display.\n\nNew driver assistance systems make day-to-day life easier. In addition to the automatic parking functions offered by the Parking Assistant, the new optional Parking Assistant Plus makes the parking process even easier. Thanks to 12 ultrasonic sensors and four surround-view cameras, the vehicle can identify possible parking spaces more clearly and can even independently initiate space-restricted parking manoeuvres. In addition, a manual parking process can be transferred to Parking Assistant Plus at any time. Explore Mode offers a uniquely convenient solution for this vehicle segment, enabling the new MINI Cooper to be parked simply using a smartphone if the space at the side is too limited for entry.\n\nThe innovative MINI Digital Key Plus option also uses the smartphone to ensure a convenient and personalised vehicle experience. Here the smartphone turns into a key, enabling automatic opening of the vehicle. The welcome projection of the front and rear lights begins as soon as the driver is within three metres of the car; the doors are unlocked when the driver is less than one and a half metres. The digital key can be transferred to different users and replaces the handover of the classic vehicle key for easier car sharing.\n\nThe MINI App also offers other functions that increase user safety. With the Remote 360 option, for example, the surroundings of the parked vehicle can be viewed in the MINI App. A camera in the inside provides a view of the interior. Furthermore, the Snapshot function offers the opportunity to capture shared moments in a photograph and to upload them via WiFi-Direct to the smartphone.\n\nEnhanced go-kart feeling thanks to electrified drivetrain technology. The new MINI Cooper combines locally emission-free mobility and all-electric driving fun. With a completely new powertrain, the vehicle is available in the Cooper E variant, and with a higher output and range also as the Cooper SE.\n\nThe 135 kW/184 hp electric motor of the MINI Cooper E generates a torque of 290 Nm, accelerating the vehicle from standstill to 100 km/h in 7.3 seconds. With an output of 160 kW/218 hp, the MINI Cooper SE sprints from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.7 seconds with a maximum torque of 330 Nm. The range determined according to the WLTP test cycle is up to 305 kilometres for the MINI Cooper E based on the high-voltage battery with 40.7 kWh of capacity. In the MINI Cooper SE, the calculated range increases to a maximum of 402 kilometres due to a battery capacity of 54.2 kWh. *\n\nExcellent driving dynamics for comfortable and sporty mobility. A slightly increased track width and wheelbase provide the basis for excellent driving dynamics. The vehicle is fitted with a suspension and damping system that is tuned for spirited handling. Combined with the precise steering feel typical of MINI, powerful brakes and a low centre of gravity thanks to the high-voltage battery installed in the floor, the new MINI Cooper enhances day-to-day convenience.\n\nWith highly preloaded stabiliser mounts on the axles, the driver experiences a significantly improved body response during dynamic cornering as well as a valuable gain in steering precision and accuracy. The result is excellent body support combined with smooth rolling comfort. The MINI Cooper is also equipped with a strut brace for an even sportier driving experience.\n\nWith its tyre diameter increased to 635 mm, the MINI Cooper has a more powerful visual presence, while at the same time offering improved driving dynamic performance and comfort. In addition, the tyre width of the optionally available 17-inch and 18-inch rims is increased by 10/20 mm to 205/225 mm to emphasise the typical MINI go-kart feeling. Available rim sizes range from 16- to 18-inch.\n\nThe precise set-up of steering and all driving stability control systems, to ensure both comfortable and sporty driving, guarantees an exceptional experience in all driving situations.\n\nNew MINI Experience Modes for individually tailored driving fun. The various MINI Experience Modes can be activated with a flick of the toggle switch “Experiences”. GO-KART mode emphasises the racing DNA of the MINI Cooper in a particularly emotional way by adjusting the agility and stability of the chassis set-up, for example. In this mode, the projector behind the central OLED display also bathes the cockpit in the John Cooper Works-inspired shades of anthracite and red. Meanwhile, further individual setting options enable configuration of the steering response and the intervention limits of the traction control to ensure even more intense driving fun.\n\nBy contrast, Green Mode optimises the efficiency of the drivetrain, orienting the electric motor towards maximum range based on various parameters. Improved recuperation management in the new MINI Cooper is one of the contributing factors here: this feeds excess energy to the battery when braking or coasting, thereby increasing the vehicle’s range. Visualisations enable the driving conditions and their influence on the vehicle’s range to be more readily understood. The driving conditions and their influence on the range can be more easily understood through visualizations. Tips for efficient driving and a power meter increase the motivation for economical driving in a fun way. For example, the driver can specifically understand the effect of their behaviour through gaining “bonus range”.\n\nThese immersive driving experiences are enhanced by completely new acoustic worlds created by the digital MINI Sounds. The repertoire includes entirely new driving sounds in the interior, an unmistakable MINI brand sound as a mark of identification, jingles for the new MINI Experience Modes, and 30 new sound signals for information and warning functions. This creates a distinctive recognition feature that is typical of MINI on the acoustic level, too.\n\nSimplified and efficient battery charging.The battery of the MINI Cooper can be charged via alternating current with 11 kW. Fast charging with direct current is possible in the MINI Cooper E with 75 kW and in the Cooper SE with up to 95 kW. At a fast charging station, this allows the battery to be charged from 10 per cent to 80 per cent in just under 30 minutes. Depending on the weather conditions, active navigation via MINI Navigation ensures the high-voltage battery reaches the ideal temperature for efficient charging in advance. This can significantly reduce charging time, especially in cold outdoor temperatures.\n\nFor a transparent and simple charging process, the customer can optimize the charging of the vehicle battery through easy-to-understand settings. The start time for charging can be selected or a specific time window for charging can be set, for example. A certain target level for battery capacity can be determined in advance, too. For a particularly pleasant start, charging can be set to be completed by a selected departure time, and the vehicle interior can be air-conditioned to the desired temperature by this time.\n\nThe MINI App provides a convenient overview of the charging process, even if the customer is not near the vehicle. This provides details of the current battery status, a charging-optimised route plan, and charging history – including all costs and savings.\n\n*The specified technical data are preliminary.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption combined: 15.03 - 14.09 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km). *All specified technical data are preliminary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a 3-door model in its fifth generation, the purely electric MINI Cooper underscores the brand’s tradition with hallmark MINI design while at the same time symbolising the all-electric future.

In this way, typical MINI design features such as the visual three-part division of the vehicle body, the all-round window area and the contrasting roof have a greater impact, helping the new design style to take effect.\n\nStriking face with fresh radiance: MINI LED-lights with Signature Modes.In the new model generation, the front end of the all-electric MINI Cooper is once again characterised by the iconic MINI circular headlights and the striking grille. These go together to create the hallmark MINI appearance. The new octagonal front grille with its filigree contour defines the front section even more powerfully than its hexagonal predecessor. Instead of chrome, the new accent colour Vibrant Silver adds highlights to the exterior, giving the new MINI Cooper an even more expressive appearance.\n\nThe daytime running light elements of theLED-lights support this striking look with fresh radiance due to unique light signatures. Horizontal light graphics are part of the Essential Trim. Optionally, the daytime running light elements can be switched to create three adjustable light signatures, thereby emphasising the distinctive character of each vehicle. In addition, all light modes start and end with a specially orchestrated welcome and goodbye animation. This interaction with the MINI Cooper heightens the sense of anticipation for the MINI even before you set off.\n\nReduced details for a powerful presence and increased dynamic performance. As with the body design as a whole, the front headlights are not framed with chrome elements anymore. This results in the front section having a focused expression. Together with the fascinating curves of the bonnet and the clear-cut design of the front apron, the new MINI 3-door has a distinct and sporty look. This impression is supported by the vehicle’s track width and the dynamic indentation at the wheel arches.\n\nThe side view of the new MINI Cooper also conveys greater reduction and clarity. For the first time, the model appears without a circumferential Black Band. Reducing the number of components places the body colour more at the centre of interest, thereby ensuring a powerful presence. Black sills visually move the MINI Cooper closer to the road. The vehicle combines a modern take on the hallmark MINI design with outstanding aerodynamic properties. The cd figure of 0.28 is outstanding for the small car segment and makes the MINI extremely efficient.\n\nThe new MINI aesthetic also gives the rear section a new, contemporary feel, featuring clear surfaces and flush rear lights. The vertical light clusters quote the classic MINI lights and can be switched to different modes in the same way as the front headlights. The third brake light and rear fog light are integrated flush into the rear design, emphasising the high quality of the sculptured modern rear section. A defined shoulder section gives the MINI Cooper a particularly powerful look. A striking black handle strip divides the rear section, its horizontal orientation highlighting the vehicle’s broad stance and the sporty flair that this conveys.\n\nFour individual trims for even more character.The all-electric MINI Cooper is available in four different trims. The Essential Trim presents maximum clarity and a reduced overall appearance, highlighting certain functional parts such as the logo in the new colour Vibrant Silver. The new range of external paint finishes underlines the modernity of the new MINI icon and sets positive accentuations with bright tones such as Sunny Side Yellow.\n\nWhile the Classic Trim primarily applies to the interior, the Favoured Trim features particularly expressive details on the exterior. This trim variant offers the new, optional Spray-Tech design of the characteristic Multitone Roof with a combination of three different colours as well as a front grille in Vibrant Silver.\n\nThe John Cooper Works Trim lends maximum emphasis to the sporty flair of the all-electric MINI Cooper with a distinctive front and rear design. The frame of the front grille and the logo in high-gloss black underline the powerful overall look, while a contrasting roof in Chili Red – inspired by motor sport – and JCW-specific bonnet stripes in red or black optionally lend visual emphasis to the driving dynamics typical of MINI.\n\nThe interior: minimalist, digital, immersive & warm.On the inside, the design of the front area echoes the famous minimalist design of the classic Mini. For the first model in 1959, Mini inventor Alec Issigonis designed an interior with a round instrument cluster in the centre and the characteristic toggle bar below. In the new MINI Cooper, it is precisely these two elements, in combination with the steering wheel, that structure the interior with its maximum purist design. Reducing everything to the essentials, the new interior makes do with a smaller number of components that are cleverly designed and implemented to a high standard. Behind the steering wheel, the optional head-up display ensures that all the relevant content appears in the driver’s field of vision. As a result, the dashboard on the driver’s side does not require an additional display, so it opens up the view to the front.\n\nThe amply sized, curved dashboard features textile surfaces for the first time. Warm, pleasant materials characterise the new, homely feel-good atmosphere in the interior of the MINI Cooper. A specially developed knitting process is used to create the versatile, easy-care structure of the textile in two-colour design made of recycled polyester. There is a choice of different colours for the textile surfaces and seats depending on the trim design. To make the dashboard as slim and spacious as possible, the air vents are very flat.\n\nThe clear lines and generous space in the front seats give the interior a modern, airy feel, while the optional panoramic glass roof makes the interior particularly bright and friendly. In the dark, the side lighting is based on the ambient light, thereby contributing to a distinctive interior atmosphere. The seats are available in a basic version and in a JCW version, with side panels that are laminated with high-quality textile covering the adjustment buttons. The armrest, mounted on the driver’s seat, provides even more space in the centre console. The rear of the vehicle offers maximum reduction and comfort, while the loading accessories can be conveniently stowed in an additional underfloor storage facility in the luggage compartment. By folding down the rear seat in a 60:40 ratio, the luggage compartment can be flexibly expanded from 200 litres to provide a volume of up to 800 litres.\n\nMINI Interaction Unit: High-Res OLED display revolutionises the user experience.The central OLED display sets a new benchmark with its high resolution. Like the round instrument in the predecessor model, the new centre icon is the defining feature of the interior with its versatile functions. As an instrument cluster, the MINI Interaction Unit is a centre of both experience and comfort. Thanks to MINI Operating System 9, all vehicle functions can be operated intuitively with touch or voice control. The display in the redesigned cockpit has been moved closer to the driver so it is particularly convenient to reach. The diameter of the thin touch display with a high-quality glass edge has grown to 240 mm. Its operating logic is reminiscent of the standards familiar from smartphones.\n\nThe graphic presentation of the content is modern and focuses on the essentials. The upper area contains relevant vehicle-related information such as speed and battery status. When the speed indicator is pressed, a large, striking display with full-screen speedometer appears that puts a clear focus on driving. In the Home menu, the other widgets are displayed in thumbnail view to the left and right of the current menu function. They can be brought up and selected by swiping horizontally to the centre. In the lower area of the OLED display, the menu items Navigation, Media, Phone and Climate can be selected directly at any time. All other functions can be accessed via the menu in the same way as on a smartphone. The display returns to the default setting via the home button.\n\nA whole new MINI experience: the new MINI Experience Modes. The MINI Experience Modes, Core, Green and Go-Kart, each with their specific user interface design, are available as standard, with up to four additional modes available with the MINI Experience Modes optional equipment. The optional MINI projector on the back of the OLED display immerses the dashboard in matching colour schemes and patterns. The interplay of projection, ambient lighting and the MINI Interaction Unit results in a unique, immersive experience that extends into the door panels.\n\nThis immersive user experience makes the interior even more expressive based on new solutions, thereby giving rise to entirely new individualisation options in the new MINI Cooper. In Personal Mode, for example, an individually selected image can be set as the display background via the MINI App. The dominant colours of the image then extend across the textile dashboard surfaces by means of a digital colour picker. The ambient lighting under the dashboard and in the door mirror is also colour-coded to match these projections.\n\nEach mode has specially designed backgrounds that convey a vibrant and high-quality effect by means of subtle movements while remaining as distraction-free as possible. When one of the seven modes is selected, the display focuses on a relevant “Mode App”. In Go-Kart Mode there is a highly dynamic focus on MINI’s racing DNA, for example. The display and the interior as a whole feature the colours anthracite and red, while specific analogue displays for driving dynamics complement this MINI Experience Mode inspired by John Cooper Works. Vivid Mode draws on the colours of the album cover for the ambient lighting. Core Mode, Green Mode, Timeless Mode, Balance Mode and Personal Mode are also available for selection according to mood and personal needs.\n\nSimply typical MINI: the redesigned toggle bar.Underneath the dashboard, the design of the new MINI Cooper is particularly clean in appearance. One of the key factors here is the newly designed toggle bar. Here, the most important driving functions (parking brake, gear selector, start/stop key, experience mode toggle, volume control) are directly accessible. Its design is individua in accordance with its function.\n\nThe direct selection options on the toggle bar eliminate the need for a gearshift, so the new MINI Cooper offers more storage space in the centre console. In addition to the enlarged cup holders, there is also a large open storage compartment. The storage box with a knitted surface and a textile strap comes as standard with the Favoured Trim. Smartphones can be charged in the wireless charging area at the front of the console and are easier to find thanks to the central storage area.\n\nFour newly designed trims for an individual look.In line with the consistent reduction in the interior, the new contemporary colour and material concept is deliberately minimalist, too. Only newly developed, high-quality and environment-friendly materials are used. The dashboard and door panels with knitted surfaces made of recycled polyester create a pleasant atmosphere while at the same time setting specific accentuations with their two-tone design. Four newly designed trims convey differing versions of the modern feel-good concept in the interior. From Classic Trim onwards, the two-spoke basic steering wheel is replaced as a three-spoke version with a new textile strap in the six o'clock spoke.\n\nThe Essential Trim features an interior of maximum clarity and reduction. Black sports seats with distinctly patterned multitone textile harmonise with a coloured textile band on the dashboard. Certain functional parts on the inside and outside are highlighted with the new accent colour Vibrant Silver. On the exterior, for example, the logo appears in the new colour, contrasting sharply with the black, octagonal front grille.\n\nIn the Classic Trim, MINI uses a modern 2D knitted textile in the interior of a production vehicle for the first time. On the dashboard and door handles, two-tone black knitted textile provides a fascinating contrast to the high-quality synthetic leather seat. It is available in grey and black featuring a perforated houndstooth pattern, while the side contrasts in blue textile.\n\nThe modern, high-quality Favoured Trim is the most expressive option, featuring a two-tone houndstooth pattern on the knitted-textile instrument panel. Available in two colours and with traditional accent stitching, the perforated Vescin sports seats complement this extravagant interior in dark and light. The exterior with the front grille in Vibrant Silver can be combined in a particularly apt way with the all-new Spray-Tech roof which features a blending of three different colours.\n\nThe JCW Trim offers the sportiest interpretation of the new material concept. Combined with multi-coloured knitted textile and black synthetic leather with red stitching, the JCW seat with sports seat geometry echoes the colour concept of the dashboard and door trim. A distinct front and rear design likewise highlights the racing DNA of the trim in the exterior, with the vehicle grille and logo in high-gloss black underlining the powerful overall impression. Optional features include a contrasting Chili Red roof and JCW-specific red or black bonnet stripes.\n\n“Hey MINI!”: the first MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant.In the new MINI Cooper, numerous functions can be controlled using the brand’s first ever fully-fledged voice assistant. The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated with the greeting “Hey MINI” or by using the push-to-talk steering wheel button. Voice-controlled interaction takes place on the round OLED display in the form of an animation of graphic elements, typography and an avatar. For the visualisation, users have the option to choose between “MINI” – a stylised representation of a MINI – or optionally \"Spike\" already familiar to many MINI fans. Communication with this virtual travel companion is particularly true-to-life thanks to improved voice recognition. In order to ensure smoother communication, oral utterances are transmitted instantly and visualised on the display. In this way, the driver can control navigation, telephony, entertainment and numerous other vehicle functions by acclamation.\n\nDuring the dialogue between customer and vehicle, the MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant continuously learns on repetitive routes. Drawing on geo-based data, for example, the vehicle can learn to automatically open the window when entering a car park. This makes day-to-day routines more convenient and personal.\n\nMINI connects: the new MINI Operating System 9. The new “Charismatic Simplicity” design language is also reflected in the aesthetic of the user interface, which brings together functional and emotional elements. The reduced design uses all-new graphics to create an extremely modern look. Static and dynamic elements blend naturally into the circular form of the OLED display, following a clear structure. Micro-animations enhance the already extremely intuitive interaction between the driver and central instrument and underscore the digital character of the new MINI family.\n\nMINI Operating System 9 is an in-house development by the BMW Group and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. Operation is intuitive and follows the standards familiar from consumer electronics.\n\nAt the centre of the screen is the start menu, where personalised content can be selected and launched by swiping to the side. In the lower section of the screen is the fixed status bar containing the menu items “Navigation”, “Media”, “Telephony”, “All Apps” and, depending on the situation, “Home”, which can be selected directly. Swiping up from the lower edge of the screen reveals a tool belt, a process customers will be familiar with from many consumer electronics devices. Favourite functions can be stored here and called up again rapidly, i. e. navigation destinations and radio stations. The tool belt can also be activated via the star button on the multifunction steering wheel. The upper screen area is reserved for driving-relevant content such as the vehicle speed and important information on the vehicle status. The optional Head-up display shows the most important information for the driver in their field of view.\n\nThe temperature for the driver and front passenger is permanently displayed on the left- and right-hand edge of the screen. The climate control settings are integrated into the MINI Interaction Unit and can always be adjusted on the top layer by touch or voice command.\n\nDepending on the Experience Mode selected, a single tap on the speed display transforms the entire MINI Interaction Unit into a MINI-typical speedometer.\n\n“The new MINI Operating System 9 is characterised by simple, emotional touch operation that is specific to MINI. Together with the new cloud-based MINI Navigation for particularly precise and fast route calculation, high-speed connectivity and optional 5G capability, the new MINI Cooper takes a giant leap into the digital world, thereby underlining the brand’s charismatic heritage,” says Stefanie Wurst, Head of MINI.\n\nWhen driving, the complete MINI Navigation Package in conjunction with the optional MINI Connected Package provides support in the form of realistic 3D visualisations in complicated turning situations, display of the current traffic situation even without activated route guidance, information on parking options including digital payment options and much more. In addition, an optional augmented reality function is available for the visualisation of turn-by-turn directions. A charge-optimised route can be calculated for the all-electric MINI Cooper immediately after entering the destination.\n\nIn addition, MINI Connected Upgrades allow flexible bookings of additional vehicle functions – simply digital. In conjunction with the optionally available MINI Connected Package, the MINI Connected Store provides access to a constantly evolving variety of practical and entertaining apps, including gaming, music and video streaming. The new AirConsole app provides a unique form of in-car gaming for all passengers, making the smartphone the controller of the game on the OLED display.\n\nNew driver assistance systems make day-to-day life easier. In addition to the automatic parking functions offered by the Parking Assistant, the new optional Parking Assistant Plus makes the parking process even easier. Thanks to 12 ultrasonic sensors and four surround-view cameras, the vehicle can identify possible parking spaces more clearly and can even independently initiate space-restricted parking manoeuvres. In addition, a manual parking process can be transferred to Parking Assistant Plus at any time. Explore Mode offers a uniquely convenient solution for this vehicle segment, enabling the new MINI Cooper to be parked simply using a smartphone if the space at the side is too limited for entry.\n\nThe innovative MINI Digital Key Plus option also uses the smartphone to ensure a convenient and personalised vehicle experience. Here the smartphone turns into a key, enabling automatic opening of the vehicle. The welcome projection of the front and rear lights begins as soon as the driver is within three metres of the car; the doors are unlocked when the driver is less than one and a half metres. The digital key can be transferred to different users and replaces the handover of the classic vehicle key for easier car sharing.\n\nThe MINI App also offers other functions that increase user safety. With the Remote 360 option, for example, the surroundings of the parked vehicle can be viewed in the MINI App. A camera in the inside provides a view of the interior. Furthermore, the Snapshot function offers the opportunity to capture shared moments in a photograph and to upload them via WiFi-Direct to the smartphone.\n\nEnhanced go-kart feeling thanks to electrified drivetrain technology. The new MINI Cooper combines locally emission-free mobility and all-electric driving fun. With a completely new powertrain, the vehicle is available in the Cooper E variant, and with a higher output and range also as the Cooper SE.\n\nThe 135 kW/184 hp electric motor of the MINI Cooper E generates a torque of 290 Nm, accelerating the vehicle from standstill to 100 km/h in 7.3 seconds. With an output of 160 kW/218 hp, the MINI Cooper SE sprints from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.7 seconds with a maximum torque of 330 Nm. The range determined according to the WLTP test cycle is up to 305 kilometres for the MINI Cooper E based on the high-voltage battery with 40.7 kWh of capacity. In the MINI Cooper SE, the calculated range increases to a maximum of 402 kilometres due to a battery capacity of 54.2 kWh. *\n\nExcellent driving dynamics for comfortable and sporty mobility. A slightly increased track width and wheelbase provide the basis for excellent driving dynamics. The vehicle is fitted with a suspension and damping system that is tuned for spirited handling. Combined with the precise steering feel typical of MINI, powerful brakes and a low centre of gravity thanks to the high-voltage battery installed in the floor, the new MINI Cooper enhances day-to-day convenience.\n\nWith highly preloaded stabiliser mounts on the axles, the driver experiences a significantly improved body response during dynamic cornering as well as a valuable gain in steering precision and accuracy. The result is excellent body support combined with smooth rolling comfort. The MINI Cooper is also equipped with a strut brace for an even sportier driving experience.\n\nWith its tyre diameter increased to 635 mm, the MINI Cooper has a more powerful visual presence, while at the same time offering improved driving dynamic performance and comfort. In addition, the tyre width of the optionally available 17-inch and 18-inch rims is increased by 10/20 mm to 205/225 mm to emphasise the typical MINI go-kart feeling. Available rim sizes range from 16- to 18-inch.\n\nThe precise set-up of steering and all driving stability control systems, to ensure both comfortable and sporty driving, guarantees an exceptional experience in all driving situations.\n\nNew MINI Experience Modes for individually tailored driving fun. The various MINI Experience Modes can be activated with a flick of the toggle switch “Experiences”. GO-KART mode emphasises the racing DNA of the MINI Cooper in a particularly emotional way by adjusting the agility and stability of the chassis set-up, for example. In this mode, the projector behind the central OLED display also bathes the cockpit in the John Cooper Works-inspired shades of anthracite and red. Meanwhile, further individual setting options enable configuration of the steering response and the intervention limits of the traction control to ensure even more intense driving fun.\n\nBy contrast, Green Mode optimises the efficiency of the drivetrain, orienting the electric motor towards maximum range based on various parameters. Improved recuperation management in the new MINI Cooper is one of the contributing factors here: this feeds excess energy to the battery when braking or coasting, thereby increasing the vehicle’s range. Visualisations enable the driving conditions and their influence on the vehicle’s range to be more readily understood. The driving conditions and their influence on the range can be more easily understood through visualizations. Tips for efficient driving and a power meter increase the motivation for economical driving in a fun way. For example, the driver can specifically understand the effect of their behaviour through gaining “bonus range”.\n\nThese immersive driving experiences are enhanced by completely new acoustic worlds created by the digital MINI Sounds. The repertoire includes entirely new driving sounds in the interior, an unmistakable MINI brand sound as a mark of identification, jingles for the new MINI Experience Modes, and 30 new sound signals for information and warning functions. This creates a distinctive recognition feature that is typical of MINI on the acoustic level, too.\n\nSimplified and efficient battery charging.The battery of the MINI Cooper can be charged via alternating current with 11 kW. Fast charging with direct current is possible in the MINI Cooper E with 75 kW and in the Cooper SE with up to 95 kW. At a fast charging station, this allows the battery to be charged from 10 per cent to 80 per cent in just under 30 minutes. Depending on the weather conditions, active navigation via MINI Navigation ensures the high-voltage battery reaches the ideal temperature for efficient charging in advance. This can significantly reduce charging time, especially in cold outdoor temperatures.\n\nFor a transparent and simple charging process, the customer can optimize the charging of the vehicle battery through easy-to-understand settings. The start time for charging can be selected or a specific time window for charging can be set, for example. A certain target level for battery capacity can be determined in advance, too. For a particularly pleasant start, charging can be set to be completed by a selected departure time, and the vehicle interior can be air-conditioned to the desired temperature by this time.\n\nThe MINI App provides a convenient overview of the charging process, even if the customer is not near the vehicle. This provides details of the current battery status, a charging-optimised route plan, and charging history – including all costs and savings.\n\n*The specified technical data are preliminary.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption combined: 15.03 - 14.09 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km). *All specified technical data are preliminary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Reinvention of the Original: The all-electric MINI Cooper."}]}

The ambient lighting under the dashboard and in the door mirror is also colour-coded to match these projections.\n\nEach mode has specially designed backgrounds that convey a vibrant and high-quality effect by means of subtle movements while remaining as distraction-free as possible. When one of the seven modes is selected, the display focuses on a relevant “Mode App”. In Go-Kart Mode there is a highly dynamic focus on MINI’s racing DNA, for example. The display and the interior as a whole feature the colours anthracite and red, while specific analogue displays for driving dynamics complement this MINI Experience Mode inspired by John Cooper Works. Vivid Mode draws on the colours of the album cover for the ambient lighting. Core Mode, Green Mode, Timeless Mode, Balance Mode and Personal Mode are also available for selection according to mood and personal needs.\n\nSimply typical MINI: the redesigned toggle bar.Underneath the dashboard, the design of the new MINI Cooper is particularly clean in appearance. One of the key factors here is the newly designed toggle bar. Here, the most important driving functions (parking brake, gear selector, start/stop key, experience mode toggle, volume control) are directly accessible. Its design is individua in accordance with its function.\n\nThe direct selection options on the toggle bar eliminate the need for a gearshift, so the new MINI Cooper offers more storage space in the centre console. In addition to the enlarged cup holders, there is also a large open storage compartment. The storage box with a knitted surface and a textile strap comes as standard with the Favoured Trim. Smartphones can be charged in the wireless charging area at the front of the console and are easier to find thanks to the central storage area.\n\nFour newly designed trims for an individual look.In line with the consistent reduction in the interior, the new contemporary colour and material concept is deliberately minimalist, too. Only newly developed, high-quality and environment-friendly materials are used. The dashboard and door panels with knitted surfaces made of recycled polyester create a pleasant atmosphere while at the same time setting specific accentuations with their two-tone design. Four newly designed trims convey differing versions of the modern feel-good concept in the interior. From Classic Trim onwards, the two-spoke basic steering wheel is replaced as a three-spoke version with a new textile strap in the six o'clock spoke.\n\nThe Essential Trim features an interior of maximum clarity and reduction. Black sports seats with distinctly patterned multitone textile harmonise with a coloured textile band on the dashboard. Certain functional parts on the inside and outside are highlighted with the new accent colour Vibrant Silver. On the exterior, for example, the logo appears in the new colour, contrasting sharply with the black, octagonal front grille.\n\nIn the Classic Trim, MINI uses a modern 2D knitted textile in the interior of a production vehicle for the first time. On the dashboard and door handles, two-tone black knitted textile provides a fascinating contrast to the high-quality synthetic leather seat. It is available in grey and black featuring a perforated houndstooth pattern, while the side contrasts in blue textile.\n\nThe modern, high-quality Favoured Trim is the most expressive option, featuring a two-tone houndstooth pattern on the knitted-textile instrument panel. Available in two colours and with traditional accent stitching, the perforated Vescin sports seats complement this extravagant interior in dark and light. The exterior with the front grille in Vibrant Silver can be combined in a particularly apt way with the all-new Spray-Tech roof which features a blending of three different colours.\n\nThe JCW Trim offers the sportiest interpretation of the new material concept. Combined with multi-coloured knitted textile and black synthetic leather with red stitching, the JCW seat with sports seat geometry echoes the colour concept of the dashboard and door trim. A distinct front and rear design likewise highlights the racing DNA of the trim in the exterior, with the vehicle grille and logo in high-gloss black underlining the powerful overall impression. Optional features include a contrasting Chili Red roof and JCW-specific red or black bonnet stripes.\n\n“Hey MINI!”: the first MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant.In the new MINI Cooper, numerous functions can be controlled using the brand’s first ever fully-fledged voice assistant. The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated with the greeting “Hey MINI” or by using the push-to-talk steering wheel button. Voice-controlled interaction takes place on the round OLED display in the form of an animation of graphic elements, typography and an avatar. For the visualisation, users have the option to choose between “MINI” – a stylised representation of a MINI – or optionally \"Spike\" already familiar to many MINI fans. Communication with this virtual travel companion is particularly true-to-life thanks to improved voice recognition. In order to ensure smoother communication, oral utterances are transmitted instantly and visualised on the display. In this way, the driver can control navigation, telephony, entertainment and numerous other vehicle functions by acclamation.\n\nDuring the dialogue between customer and vehicle, the MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant continuously learns on repetitive routes. Drawing on geo-based data, for example, the vehicle can learn to automatically open the window when entering a car park. This makes day-to-day routines more convenient and personal.\n\nMINI connects: the new MINI Operating System 9. The new “Charismatic Simplicity” design language is also reflected in the aesthetic of the user interface, which brings together functional and emotional elements. The reduced design uses all-new graphics to create an extremely modern look. Static and dynamic elements blend naturally into the circular form of the OLED display, following a clear structure. Micro-animations enhance the already extremely intuitive interaction between the driver and central instrument and underscore the digital character of the new MINI family.\n\nMINI Operating System 9 is an in-house development by the BMW Group and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. Operation is intuitive and follows the standards familiar from consumer electronics.\n\nAt the centre of the screen is the start menu, where personalised content can be selected and launched by swiping to the side. In the lower section of the screen is the fixed status bar containing the menu items “Navigation”, “Media”, “Telephony”, “All Apps” and, depending on the situation, “Home”, which can be selected directly. Swiping up from the lower edge of the screen reveals a tool belt, a process customers will be familiar with from many consumer electronics devices. Favourite functions can be stored here and called up again rapidly, i. e. navigation destinations and radio stations. The tool belt can also be activated via the star button on the multifunction steering wheel. The upper screen area is reserved for driving-relevant content such as the vehicle speed and important information on the vehicle status. The optional Head-up display shows the most important information for the driver in their field of view.\n\nThe temperature for the driver and front passenger is permanently displayed on the left- and right-hand edge of the screen. The climate control settings are integrated into the MINI Interaction Unit and can always be adjusted on the top layer by touch or voice command.\n\nDepending on the Experience Mode selected, a single tap on the speed display transforms the entire MINI Interaction Unit into a MINI-typical speedometer.\n\n“The new MINI Operating System 9 is characterised by simple, emotional touch operation that is specific to MINI. Together with the new cloud-based MINI Navigation for particularly precise and fast route calculation, high-speed connectivity and optional 5G capability, the new MINI Cooper takes a giant leap into the digital world, thereby underlining the brand’s charismatic heritage,” says Stefanie Wurst, Head of MINI.\n\nWhen driving, the complete MINI Navigation Package in conjunction with the optional MINI Connected Package provides support in the form of realistic 3D visualisations in complicated turning situations, display of the current traffic situation even without activated route guidance, information on parking options including digital payment options and much more. In addition, an optional augmented reality function is available for the visualisation of turn-by-turn directions. A charge-optimised route can be calculated for the all-electric MINI Cooper immediately after entering the destination.\n\nIn addition, MINI Connected Upgrades allow flexible bookings of additional vehicle functions – simply digital. In conjunction with the optionally available MINI Connected Package, the MINI Connected Store provides access to a constantly evolving variety of practical and entertaining apps, including gaming, music and video streaming. The new AirConsole app provides a unique form of in-car gaming for all passengers, making the smartphone the controller of the game on the OLED display.\n\nNew driver assistance systems make day-to-day life easier. In addition to the automatic parking functions offered by the Parking Assistant, the new optional Parking Assistant Plus makes the parking process even easier. Thanks to 12 ultrasonic sensors and four surround-view cameras, the vehicle can identify possible parking spaces more clearly and can even independently initiate space-restricted parking manoeuvres. In addition, a manual parking process can be transferred to Parking Assistant Plus at any time. Explore Mode offers a uniquely convenient solution for this vehicle segment, enabling the new MINI Cooper to be parked simply using a smartphone if the space at the side is too limited for entry.\n\nThe innovative MINI Digital Key Plus option also uses the smartphone to ensure a convenient and personalised vehicle experience. Here the smartphone turns into a key, enabling automatic opening of the vehicle. The welcome projection of the front and rear lights begins as soon as the driver is within three metres of the car; the doors are unlocked when the driver is less than one and a half metres. The digital key can be transferred to different users and replaces the handover of the classic vehicle key for easier car sharing.\n\nThe MINI App also offers other functions that increase user safety. With the Remote 360 option, for example, the surroundings of the parked vehicle can be viewed in the MINI App. A camera in the inside provides a view of the interior. Furthermore, the Snapshot function offers the opportunity to capture shared moments in a photograph and to upload them via WiFi-Direct to the smartphone.\n\nEnhanced go-kart feeling thanks to electrified drivetrain technology. The new MINI Cooper combines locally emission-free mobility and all-electric driving fun. With a completely new powertrain, the vehicle is available in the Cooper E variant, and with a higher output and range also as the Cooper SE.\n\nThe 135 kW/184 hp electric motor of the MINI Cooper E generates a torque of 290 Nm, accelerating the vehicle from standstill to 100 km/h in 7.3 seconds. With an output of 160 kW/218 hp, the MINI Cooper SE sprints from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.7 seconds with a maximum torque of 330 Nm. The range determined according to the WLTP test cycle is up to 305 kilometres for the MINI Cooper E based on the high-voltage battery with 40.7 kWh of capacity. In the MINI Cooper SE, the calculated range increases to a maximum of 402 kilometres due to a battery capacity of 54.2 kWh. *\n\nExcellent driving dynamics for comfortable and sporty mobility. A slightly increased track width and wheelbase provide the basis for excellent driving dynamics. The vehicle is fitted with a suspension and damping system that is tuned for spirited handling. Combined with the precise steering feel typical of MINI, powerful brakes and a low centre of gravity thanks to the high-voltage battery installed in the floor, the new MINI Cooper enhances day-to-day convenience.\n\nWith highly preloaded stabiliser mounts on the axles, the driver experiences a significantly improved body response during dynamic cornering as well as a valuable gain in steering precision and accuracy. The result is excellent body support combined with smooth rolling comfort. The MINI Cooper is also equipped with a strut brace for an even sportier driving experience.\n\nWith its tyre diameter increased to 635 mm, the MINI Cooper has a more powerful visual presence, while at the same time offering improved driving dynamic performance and comfort. In addition, the tyre width of the optionally available 17-inch and 18-inch rims is increased by 10/20 mm to 205/225 mm to emphasise the typical MINI go-kart feeling. Available rim sizes range from 16- to 18-inch.\n\nThe precise set-up of steering and all driving stability control systems, to ensure both comfortable and sporty driving, guarantees an exceptional experience in all driving situations.\n\nNew MINI Experience Modes for individually tailored driving fun. The various MINI Experience Modes can be activated with a flick of the toggle switch “Experiences”. GO-KART mode emphasises the racing DNA of the MINI Cooper in a particularly emotional way by adjusting the agility and stability of the chassis set-up, for example. In this mode, the projector behind the central OLED display also bathes the cockpit in the John Cooper Works-inspired shades of anthracite and red. Meanwhile, further individual setting options enable configuration of the steering response and the intervention limits of the traction control to ensure even more intense driving fun.\n\nBy contrast, Green Mode optimises the efficiency of the drivetrain, orienting the electric motor towards maximum range based on various parameters. Improved recuperation management in the new MINI Cooper is one of the contributing factors here: this feeds excess energy to the battery when braking or coasting, thereby increasing the vehicle’s range. Visualisations enable the driving conditions and their influence on the vehicle’s range to be more readily understood. The driving conditions and their influence on the range can be more easily understood through visualizations. Tips for efficient driving and a power meter increase the motivation for economical driving in a fun way. For example, the driver can specifically understand the effect of their behaviour through gaining “bonus range”.\n\nThese immersive driving experiences are enhanced by completely new acoustic worlds created by the digital MINI Sounds. The repertoire includes entirely new driving sounds in the interior, an unmistakable MINI brand sound as a mark of identification, jingles for the new MINI Experience Modes, and 30 new sound signals for information and warning functions. This creates a distinctive recognition feature that is typical of MINI on the acoustic level, too.\n\nSimplified and efficient battery charging.The battery of the MINI Cooper can be charged via alternating current with 11 kW. Fast charging with direct current is possible in the MINI Cooper E with 75 kW and in the Cooper SE with up to 95 kW. At a fast charging station, this allows the battery to be charged from 10 per cent to 80 per cent in just under 30 minutes. Depending on the weather conditions, active navigation via MINI Navigation ensures the high-voltage battery reaches the ideal temperature for efficient charging in advance. This can significantly reduce charging time, especially in cold outdoor temperatures.\n\nFor a transparent and simple charging process, the customer can optimize the charging of the vehicle battery through easy-to-understand settings. The start time for charging can be selected or a specific time window for charging can be set, for example. A certain target level for battery capacity can be determined in advance, too. For a particularly pleasant start, charging can be set to be completed by a selected departure time, and the vehicle interior can be air-conditioned to the desired temperature by this time.\n\nThe MINI App provides a convenient overview of the charging process, even if the customer is not near the vehicle. This provides details of the current battery status, a charging-optimised route plan, and charging history – including all costs and savings.\n\n*The specified technical data are preliminary.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption combined: 15.03 - 14.09 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km). *All specified technical data are preliminary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "MINI Cooper, MINI Electric, 3 Door"}]}

Electrified go-kart feeling and an immersive user experience take the MINI DNA to a whole new level.Munich. The purist design and the all-electric drivetrain of the new MINI Cooper are consistently geared towards urban driving fun, highlighting the exceptional status of the MINI within its vehicle segment. There is virtually no other vehicle model in the world that has succeeded in accentuating its own history and tradition based on evolutionary advancements while at the same time repeatedly setting new technical standards over a period of more than 60 years of construction. What has remained is the underlying notion of a vehicle that offers the greatest possible space utilisation for passengers despite compact external dimensions. New features include the world of digital experiences, modern assistance systems and a purely electric powertrain that guarantees locally emission-free mobility. As such, the fifth generation is a typical MINI while at the same time symbolising the brand’s all-electric future.\n\n“With its electric drive and purist design, the new MINI Cooper is a perfect fit for an urban lifestyle. In the fifth generation of the MINI Cooper, we combine the traditional MINI DNA with innovative, future-oriented technology while enabling locally emission-free driving fun that is typical of MINI,” says Stefanie Wurst, Head of MINI.\n\nCharismatic Simplicity: the new MINI design style.The design of the new MINI model generation is modern, digital and unmistakable. With the new MINI family, the brand takes driving fun, the user experience and a responsible attitude forward into a new era. This comprehensive transformation on the way to becoming an all-electric brand by 2030 is reflected in the authentic design of the new models, combining forward-looking technology with the elementary principles of body design and the brand’s origins. In doing so, it emphasises the urban character of the MINI along with the sheer joy of innovation.\n\n“Inspired by our history, we have developed our own new design language, defining our DNA. We call it ‘Charismatic Simplicity’. The idea behind it is a design that gives each new MINI model a strong, individual character and is characterized by a clear, reduced design language intuitively focused on the essentials of the brand.” says Oliver Heilmer, Head of MINI Design.\n\nThe exterior: maximum reduction to the essentials.In the new model generation once again, the MINI 3-door embodies the core of the brand. With its fully electric drivetrain, the new MINI Cooper is consistently geared towards urban driving fun, transporting the character of the iconic model into the brand’s purely electric future.\n\nThe agile and compact silhouette features hallmark MINI proportions: short overhangs, a short bonnet and the contrasting long wheelbase with large wheels give the fifth model generation of the MINI Cooper a fascinating charisma with classic design features. At the same time, this emphasises the athletic impression and underlines the model’s contemporary urban orientation.\n\nDetails such as the flush door handles and the absence of fender flares and classic side scuttles support the modern design of the exterior by giving the surfaces a striking clarity. This reduction to the essentials places even more emphasis on the body paint finish on the larger body surface. In this way, typical MINI design features such as the visual three-part division of the vehicle body, the all-round window area and the contrasting roof have a greater impact, helping the new design style to take effect.\n\nStriking face with fresh radiance: MINI LED-lights with Signature Modes.In the new model generation, the front end of the all-electric MINI Cooper is once again characterised by the iconic MINI circular headlights and the striking grille. These go together to create the hallmark MINI appearance. The new octagonal front grille with its filigree contour defines the front section even more powerfully than its hexagonal predecessor. Instead of chrome, the new accent colour Vibrant Silver adds highlights to the exterior, giving the new MINI Cooper an even more expressive appearance.\n\nThe daytime running light elements of theLED-lights support this striking look with fresh radiance due to unique light signatures. Horizontal light graphics are part of the Essential Trim. Optionally, the daytime running light elements can be switched to create three adjustable light signatures, thereby emphasising the distinctive character of each vehicle. In addition, all light modes start and end with a specially orchestrated welcome and goodbye animation. This interaction with the MINI Cooper heightens the sense of anticipation for the MINI even before you set off.\n\nReduced details for a powerful presence and increased dynamic performance. As with the body design as a whole, the front headlights are not framed with chrome elements anymore. This results in the front section having a focused expression. Together with the fascinating curves of the bonnet and the clear-cut design of the front apron, the new MINI 3-door has a distinct and sporty look. This impression is supported by the vehicle’s track width and the dynamic indentation at the wheel arches.\n\nThe side view of the new MINI Cooper also conveys greater reduction and clarity. For the first time, the model appears without a circumferential Black Band. Reducing the number of components places the body colour more at the centre of interest, thereby ensuring a powerful presence. Black sills visually move the MINI Cooper closer to the road. The vehicle combines a modern take on the hallmark MINI design with outstanding aerodynamic properties. The cd figure of 0.28 is outstanding for the small car segment and makes the MINI extremely efficient.\n\nThe new MINI aesthetic also gives the rear section a new, contemporary feel, featuring clear surfaces and flush rear lights. The vertical light clusters quote the classic MINI lights and can be switched to different modes in the same way as the front headlights. The third brake light and rear fog light are integrated flush into the rear design, emphasising the high quality of the sculptured modern rear section. A defined shoulder section gives the MINI Cooper a particularly powerful look. A striking black handle strip divides the rear section, its horizontal orientation highlighting the vehicle’s broad stance and the sporty flair that this conveys.\n\nFour individual trims for even more character.The all-electric MINI Cooper is available in four different trims. The Essential Trim presents maximum clarity and a reduced overall appearance, highlighting certain functional parts such as the logo in the new colour Vibrant Silver. The new range of external paint finishes underlines the modernity of the new MINI icon and sets positive accentuations with bright tones such as Sunny Side Yellow.\n\nWhile the Classic Trim primarily applies to the interior, the Favoured Trim features particularly expressive details on the exterior. This trim variant offers the new, optional Spray-Tech design of the characteristic Multitone Roof with a combination of three different colours as well as a front grille in Vibrant Silver.\n\nThe John Cooper Works Trim lends maximum emphasis to the sporty flair of the all-electric MINI Cooper with a distinctive front and rear design. The frame of the front grille and the logo in high-gloss black underline the powerful overall look, while a contrasting roof in Chili Red – inspired by motor sport – and JCW-specific bonnet stripes in red or black optionally lend visual emphasis to the driving dynamics typical of MINI.\n\nThe interior: minimalist, digital, immersive & warm.On the inside, the design of the front area echoes the famous minimalist design of the classic Mini. For the first model in 1959, Mini inventor Alec Issigonis designed an interior with a round instrument cluster in the centre and the characteristic toggle bar below. In the new MINI Cooper, it is precisely these two elements, in combination with the steering wheel, that structure the interior with its maximum purist design. Reducing everything to the essentials, the new interior makes do with a smaller number of components that are cleverly designed and implemented to a high standard. Behind the steering wheel, the optional head-up display ensures that all the relevant content appears in the driver’s field of vision. As a result, the dashboard on the driver’s side does not require an additional display, so it opens up the view to the front.\n\nThe amply sized, curved dashboard features textile surfaces for the first time. Warm, pleasant materials characterise the new, homely feel-good atmosphere in the interior of the MINI Cooper. A specially developed knitting process is used to create the versatile, easy-care structure of the textile in two-colour design made of recycled polyester. There is a choice of different colours for the textile surfaces and seats depending on the trim design. To make the dashboard as slim and spacious as possible, the air vents are very flat.\n\nThe clear lines and generous space in the front seats give the interior a modern, airy feel, while the optional panoramic glass roof makes the interior particularly bright and friendly. In the dark, the side lighting is based on the ambient light, thereby contributing to a distinctive interior atmosphere. The seats are available in a basic version and in a JCW version, with side panels that are laminated with high-quality textile covering the adjustment buttons. The armrest, mounted on the driver’s seat, provides even more space in the centre console. The rear of the vehicle offers maximum reduction and comfort, while the loading accessories can be conveniently stowed in an additional underfloor storage facility in the luggage compartment. By folding down the rear seat in a 60:40 ratio, the luggage compartment can be flexibly expanded from 200 litres to provide a volume of up to 800 litres.\n\nMINI Interaction Unit: High-Res OLED display revolutionises the user experience.The central OLED display sets a new benchmark with its high resolution. Like the round instrument in the predecessor model, the new centre icon is the defining feature of the interior with its versatile functions. As an instrument cluster, the MINI Interaction Unit is a centre of both experience and comfort. Thanks to MINI Operating System 9, all vehicle functions can be operated intuitively with touch or voice control. The display in the redesigned cockpit has been moved closer to the driver so it is particularly convenient to reach. The diameter of the thin touch display with a high-quality glass edge has grown to 240 mm. Its operating logic is reminiscent of the standards familiar from smartphones.\n\nThe graphic presentation of the content is modern and focuses on the essentials. The upper area contains relevant vehicle-related information such as speed and battery status. When the speed indicator is pressed, a large, striking display with full-screen speedometer appears that puts a clear focus on driving. In the Home menu, the other widgets are displayed in thumbnail view to the left and right of the current menu function. They can be brought up and selected by swiping horizontally to the centre. In the lower area of the OLED display, the menu items Navigation, Media, Phone and Climate can be selected directly at any time. All other functions can be accessed via the menu in the same way as on a smartphone. The display returns to the default setting via the home button.\n\nA whole new MINI experience: the new MINI Experience Modes. The MINI Experience Modes, Core, Green and Go-Kart, each with their specific user interface design, are available as standard, with up to four additional modes available with the MINI Experience Modes optional equipment. The optional MINI projector on the back of the OLED display immerses the dashboard in matching colour schemes and patterns. The interplay of projection, ambient lighting and the MINI Interaction Unit results in a unique, immersive experience that extends into the door panels.\n\nThis immersive user experience makes the interior even more expressive based on new solutions, thereby giving rise to entirely new individualisation options in the new MINI Cooper. In Personal Mode, for example, an individually selected image can be set as the display background via the MINI App. The dominant colours of the image then extend across the textile dashboard surfaces by means of a digital colour picker. The ambient lighting under the dashboard and in the door mirror is also colour-coded to match these projections.\n\nEach mode has specially designed backgrounds that convey a vibrant and high-quality effect by means of subtle movements while remaining as distraction-free as possible. When one of the seven modes is selected, the display focuses on a relevant “Mode App”. In Go-Kart Mode there is a highly dynamic focus on MINI’s racing DNA, for example. The display and the interior as a whole feature the colours anthracite and red, while specific analogue displays for driving dynamics complement this MINI Experience Mode inspired by John Cooper Works. Vivid Mode draws on the colours of the album cover for the ambient lighting. Core Mode, Green Mode, Timeless Mode, Balance Mode and Personal Mode are also available for selection according to mood and personal needs.\n\nSimply typical MINI: the redesigned toggle bar.Underneath the dashboard, the design of the new MINI Cooper is particularly clean in appearance. One of the key factors here is the newly designed toggle bar. Here, the most important driving functions (parking brake, gear selector, start/stop key, experience mode toggle, volume control) are directly accessible. Its design is individua in accordance with its function.\n\nThe direct selection options on the toggle bar eliminate the need for a gearshift, so the new MINI Cooper offers more storage space in the centre console. In addition to the enlarged cup holders, there is also a large open storage compartment. The storage box with a knitted surface and a textile strap comes as standard with the Favoured Trim.

On the dashboard and door handles, two-tone black knitted textile provides a fascinating contrast to the high-quality synthetic leather seat. It is available in grey and black featuring a perforated houndstooth pattern, while the side contrasts in blue textile.\n\nThe modern, high-quality Favoured Trim is the most expressive option, featuring a two-tone houndstooth pattern on the knitted-textile instrument panel. Available in two colours and with traditional accent stitching, the perforated Vescin sports seats complement this extravagant interior in dark and light. The exterior with the front grille in Vibrant Silver can be combined in a particularly apt way with the all-new Spray-Tech roof which features a blending of three different colours.\n\nThe JCW Trim offers the sportiest interpretation of the new material concept. Combined with multi-coloured knitted textile and black synthetic leather with red stitching, the JCW seat with sports seat geometry echoes the colour concept of the dashboard and door trim. A distinct front and rear design likewise highlights the racing DNA of the trim in the exterior, with the vehicle grille and logo in high-gloss black underlining the powerful overall impression. Optional features include a contrasting Chili Red roof and JCW-specific red or black bonnet stripes.\n\n“Hey MINI!”: the first MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant.In the new MINI Cooper, numerous functions can be controlled using the brand’s first ever fully-fledged voice assistant. The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated with the greeting “Hey MINI” or by using the push-to-talk steering wheel button. Voice-controlled interaction takes place on the round OLED display in the form of an animation of graphic elements, typography and an avatar. For the visualisation, users have the option to choose between “MINI” – a stylised representation of a MINI – or optionally \"Spike\" already familiar to many MINI fans.

In addition to the automatic parking functions offered by the Parking Assistant, the new optional Parking Assistant Plus makes the parking process even easier. Thanks to 12 ultrasonic sensors and four surround-view cameras, the vehicle can identify possible parking spaces more clearly and can even independently initiate space-restricted parking manoeuvres. In addition, a manual parking process can be transferred to Parking Assistant Plus at any time. Explore Mode offers a uniquely convenient solution for this vehicle segment, enabling the new MINI Cooper to be parked simply using a smartphone if the space at the side is too limited for entry.\n\nThe innovative MINI Digital Key Plus option also uses the smartphone to ensure a convenient and personalised vehicle experience. Here the smartphone turns into a key, enabling automatic opening of the vehicle. The welcome projection of the front and rear lights begins as soon as the driver is within three metres of the car; the doors are unlocked when the driver is less than one and a half metres. The digital key can be transferred to different users and replaces the handover of the classic vehicle key for easier car sharing.\n\nThe MINI App also offers other functions that increase user safety. With the Remote 360 option, for example, the surroundings of the parked vehicle can be viewed in the MINI App. A camera in the inside provides a view of the interior. Furthermore, the Snapshot function offers the opportunity to capture shared moments in a photograph and to upload them via WiFi-Direct to the smartphone.\n\nEnhanced go-kart feeling thanks to electrified drivetrain technology. The new MINI Cooper combines locally emission-free mobility and all-electric driving fun. With a completely new powertrain, the vehicle is available in the Cooper E variant, and with a higher output and range also as the Cooper SE.\n\nThe 135 kW/184 hp electric motor of the MINI Cooper E generates a torque of 290 Nm, accelerating the vehicle from standstill to 100 km/h in 7.3 seconds. With an output of 160 kW/218 hp, the MINI Cooper SE sprints from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.7 seconds with a maximum torque of 330 Nm. The range determined according to the WLTP test cycle is up to 305 kilometres for the MINI Cooper E based on the high-voltage battery with 40.7 kWh of capacity. In the MINI Cooper SE, the calculated range increases to a maximum of 402 kilometres due to a battery capacity of 54.2 kWh. *\n\nExcellent driving dynamics for comfortable and sporty mobility. A slightly increased track width and wheelbase provide the basis for excellent driving dynamics. The vehicle is fitted with a suspension and damping system that is tuned for spirited handling. Combined with the precise steering feel typical of MINI, powerful brakes and a low centre of gravity thanks to the high-voltage battery installed in the floor, the new MINI Cooper enhances day-to-day convenience.\n\nWith highly preloaded stabiliser mounts on the axles, the driver experiences a significantly improved body response during dynamic cornering as well as a valuable gain in steering precision and accuracy. The result is excellent body support combined with smooth rolling comfort. The MINI Cooper is also equipped with a strut brace for an even sportier driving experience.\n\nWith its tyre diameter increased to 635 mm, the MINI Cooper has a more powerful visual presence, while at the same time offering improved driving dynamic performance and comfort. In addition, the tyre width of the optionally available 17-inch and 18-inch rims is increased by 10/20 mm to 205/225 mm to emphasise the typical MINI go-kart feeling. Available rim sizes range from 16- to 18-inch.\n\nThe precise set-up of steering and all driving stability control systems, to ensure both comfortable and sporty driving, guarantees an exceptional experience in all driving situations.\n\nNew MINI Experience Modes for individually tailored driving fun. The various MINI Experience Modes can be activated with a flick of the toggle switch “Experiences”. GO-KART mode emphasises the racing DNA of the MINI Cooper in a particularly emotional way by adjusting the agility and stability of the chassis set-up, for example. In this mode, the projector behind the central OLED display also bathes the cockpit in the John Cooper Works-inspired shades of anthracite and red. Meanwhile, further individual setting options enable configuration of the steering response and the intervention limits of the traction control to ensure even more intense driving fun.\n\nBy contrast, Green Mode optimises the efficiency of the drivetrain, orienting the electric motor towards maximum range based on various parameters. Improved recuperation management in the new MINI Cooper is one of the contributing factors here: this feeds excess energy to the battery when braking or coasting, thereby increasing the vehicle’s range. Visualisations enable the driving conditions and their influence on the vehicle’s range to be more readily understood. The driving conditions and their influence on the range can be more easily understood through visualizations. Tips for efficient driving and a power meter increase the motivation for economical driving in a fun way. For example, the driver can specifically understand the effect of their behaviour through gaining “bonus range”.\n\nThese immersive driving experiences are enhanced by completely new acoustic worlds created by the digital MINI Sounds. The repertoire includes entirely new driving sounds in the interior, an unmistakable MINI brand sound as a mark of identification, jingles for the new MINI Experience Modes, and 30 new sound signals for information and warning functions. This creates a distinctive recognition feature that is typical of MINI on the acoustic level, too.\n\nSimplified and efficient battery charging.The battery of the MINI Cooper can be charged via alternating current with 11 kW. Fast charging with direct current is possible in the MINI Cooper E with 75 kW and in the Cooper SE with up to 95 kW. At a fast charging station, this allows the battery to be charged from 10 per cent to 80 per cent in just under 30 minutes. Depending on the weather conditions, active navigation via MINI Navigation ensures the high-voltage battery reaches the ideal temperature for efficient charging in advance. This can significantly reduce charging time, especially in cold outdoor temperatures.\n\nFor a transparent and simple charging process, the customer can optimize the charging of the vehicle battery through easy-to-understand settings. The start time for charging can be selected or a specific time window for charging can be set, for example. A certain target level for battery capacity can be determined in advance, too. For a particularly pleasant start, charging can be set to be completed by a selected departure time, and the vehicle interior can be air-conditioned to the desired temperature by this time.\n\nThe MINI App provides a convenient overview of the charging process, even if the customer is not near the vehicle. This provides details of the current battery status, a charging-optimised route plan, and charging history – including all costs and savings.\n\n*The specified technical data are preliminary.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption combined: 15.03 - 14.09 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km). *All specified technical data are preliminary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The BMW Group expects sequentially increasing deliveries in the final quarter of 2024. This follows a third quarter in which technical actions linked to the Integrated Braking System (IBS) presented extraordinary challenges. As stated in the ad hoc announcement on September 10, the technical actions – together with weak demand in China – dampened the sales and revenue situation in the reporting period from July to September. Moreover, additional IBS-related provisions for warranty obligations in the high three-digit million-euro range impacted the third quarter. As a result, the BMW Group adjusted its 2024 financial guidance.\n\nNevertheless, the ramp-up in e-mobility remained strong and made a positive contribution in Q3. BMW Group BEV deliveries grew significantly by +10.1% compared to the previous year, and the share of sales of fully electric vehicles rose to 19.1% percent.\n\nThe BMW Group delivered a total of 1,754,157 automobiles in the nine-month period (2023:1,836,563 automobiles/ -4.5%). In the third quarter, the premium manufacturer delivered 540,881 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles (2023: 621,699 automobiles/ -13.0%).\n\nThe BMW Group benefits from its global presence and was able to balance out the different sales developments in the major world regions. The BMW brand grew by +4% outside China and gained +0.1% points in global market share while the premium brands MINI and Rolls-Royce were affected by model changes.\n\nIn Europe, the BMW brand experienced moderate growth of +7.6% over the nine-month period. Double digit growth in individual markets such as Spain, UK, France and Italy was a key driver. Despite a notable impact of the IBS issue in the Americas region and delivery stops in the US market, BMW sales reached the previous year's level and BMW maintained a stable market share.\n\nThe company has been working hard to replace the IBS components and is expediting the processing of vehicles in customer hands and those in stock. The majority of stock vehicles requiring action will be addressed and delivered before the end of the year.\n\n“After the extraordinary challenges in the third quarter, we are looking ahead: In the fourth quarter, we are back on track for stronger earnings in order to achieve our annual targets, despite planned high upfront expenditures,” said the Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Oliver Zipse, on Wednesday. “We are striking a balance between securing short-term earnings and long-term success: This year we are investing more than ever in new products, technologies and our plants, so that we can continue the BMW success story with the NEUE KLASSE from next year onwards.”\n\nIBS-related delivery stops and delays significantly impacted the BMW Group key financial figures in the reporting period: In Q3, the BMW Group posted revenues of €32,406 million (2023: €38,458 million/ -15.7%; adjusted for currency translation effects -15.3%; Sep YTD: €105,964 million; 2023: €112,530 million/ -5.8%; adjusted for currency translation effects -4.8%).\n\nR&D spending and capital expenditure to secure future competitiveness\n\nThe BMW Group has a solid and robust balance sheet which enables continued investments in the future. As previously announced, the company expects to post peak figures for both research & development and capital expenditure in 2024.At the core is the roll-out of NEUE KLASSE across the whole portfolio focused on electrification, decarbonisation and digitalisation of its product line-up and structures.\n\nGroup research and development expenditure for the first nine months totalled €6,642 million and was significantly higher than the previous year (2023: € 5,223 million/ +27.2%; in Q3: € 2,473 million/ +35.4%). The R&D ratio of 6.3% was also higher year-on-year due to declining revenues (2023: 4.6%/+1.7 percentage points; in Q3: 7.6%; +2.8 percentage points).\n\nImpact on Group and Automotive Segment financial figures\n\nGroup operating profit (EBIT) in the third quarter was €1,696 million (Q3 2023:\n\n€4,352 million/ -61.0%; Sep YTD: €9,627 million; 2023: €14,070 million/ -31.6%). Negative fair value measurement effects resulting from falling interest rates contributed significantly to the decline in the Group financial result of €-858 million (Q3/2023: €-289 million; Sep YTD: €-766 million; 2023: €-656 million). As a result, Group earnings before tax in the third quarter declined to €838 million (€4,063 million/ -79.4%; Sep YTD: €8,861 million; 2023: €13,414 million/ -33.9%). The Group EBT margin came in at 2.6% respectively at 8.4% after nine months (Q3/ 2023: 10.6%/ -8.0%-pts.; 2023: 11.9%/ -3.5%-pts.)\n\nThe Automotive Segment posted revenues of €27,854 million (2023: €32,096 million /-13.2%;adjusted for currency translation effects -12.8%) in the third quarter (Sep YTD: €90,863 million (2023: €94,994 million/-4.3%; adjusted for currency translation effects -3.1%). Vehicle sales declined and product mix was negatively impacted – mainly due to weaker demand in China and IBS-related delivery stops of higher-class vehicle models.\n\nEarnings before financial result (EBIT) in the same reporting period totalled € 634 million (Q3 2023: €3,135 million/ -79.8%; Sep YTD: €6,028 million (2023: €9,810 million/ -38.6%). The EBIT margin decreased to 2.3% respectively to 6.6% in Sep YTD (Q3 2023: 9.8%/ -7.5 %-pts.; 2023: 10.3%/ -3.7%-pts). Excluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 3.5% for the third quarter and 7.7% for September YTD.\n\nFree cash flow impacted by capital expenditure and inventory\n\nLower earnings and increased inventory – resulting from delivery stops and lower sales volumes – had a particular impact on Q3 auto free cash flow. Working capital changed by €-1.934 million over the period and high capital expenditure of €3,311 million weighed on free cash flow. In the third quarter, it posted €-2,480 million (2023: €2,618 million; Sep YTD: €-191 million/ 2023: €5,759 million). With the release of stock vehicles following IBS exchange, the company is aiming for inventory levels at the previous year's level in the fourth quarter. Lower inventory levels and a sequentially higher result will contribute to the forecast free cash flow of >€4 billion despite further high investments.\n\n“With stringent management, the BMW Group remains on track for the forecast auto free cash flow for the full year”, said BMW Group Chief Financial Officer Walter Mertl. “In the fourth quarter, sequentially higher deliveries and a stronger product mix will support our earnings. Despite the extraordinary pressures in Q3, we are adhering to our planned extensive investments. These are the basis for our future automotive portfolio, for our profit generation in the coming years. We are committed to our future and are shaping it today with focus”, said Mertl.\n\nCapex ratio in the third quarter was 6.7%; after nine months and stood at 5.3%. A capex ratio of > 6% is expected for the year as a whole — as in previous years, the fourth quarter will also show seasonally high capital expenditure.\n\nThe BMW Group has consistently continued its share buyback program: The third tranche of the current second share buyback programwas successfully completed on October 25, 2024.\n\nBased on the authorization of the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2022, BMW AG acquired a total of 6.19% of the share capital as of September 30, 2024.\n\nFinancial Services Segment sees significant growth in new business\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the number of new financing and leasing contracts concluded in the first nine months of the year rose significantly to 1,252,251 (2023: 1,112,817 contracts/ +12.5%). The segment's volume of new business also grew significantly to €46,531 million (2023: €40,973 million/ +13.6%). The penetration rate increased to 42.3% (2023: 37.7%; +4.6 %-pts.).\n\nFor the year to the end of September, the segment reported an EBT of € 2,146 million (2023: €2,451 million/ -12.4%). Lower revenues from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, that resulted largely from the continuing normalisation of global used car markets, primarily weighed on the result. During the nine-month period, the credit loss ratio was 0.26% across the entire loan portfolio (2023: 0.15%).\n\nAdjusted guidance confirmed\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the BMW Group will continue to implement the measures outlined in the IBS technical campaigns with focus and urgency. Accordingly, it intends to hand over vehicles to customers that have been blocked to date. In many markets, the BMW Group is experiencing robust demand for its premium vehicles.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2024, the BMW Group is confirming its adjusted full-year guidance as of September 10: Group earnings before taxes will decrease significantly. Vehicle deliveries in the Automotive Segment will be slightly lower than the previous year. The EBIT margin for 2024 is forecast to be within the range of 6% to 7%. The return on capital employed (RoCE) is expected to be between 11% and 13%.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE) in the Financial Services Segment is projected to be between 15-18%, reflecting the current improvement in business development.\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, faced with a challenging market and competitive landscape, the BMW Group expects customer deliveries to be on a par with the previous year. The EBIT margin for 2024 will be in the range of 6% to 7%, with a return on capital employed (RoCE) of between 14% and 16%. These targets will be achieved with slightly higher employee numbers.\n\nThis guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate. Given the many uncertainties surrounding the existing risks and opportunities, the BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from current expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group continues to fully leverage its young and attractive product portfolio and its proven approach of technology openness. Thanks to its flexibility, the balance across key global regions and a strong balance sheet, it is able to adapt to dynamic market changes while consistently pursuing its long-term business success.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: YTD Q3 2024\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEmployees (as of 31 Dec. 2023)\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues.\n\n3 Common/preferred shares.

In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result.

The BMW Group expects sequentially increasing deliveries in the final quarter of 2024. This follows a third quarter in which technical actions linked to the Integrated Braking System (IBS) presented extraordinary challenges. As stated in the ad hoc announcement on September 10, the technical actions – together with weak demand in China – dampened the sales and revenue situation in the reporting period from July to September. Moreover, additional IBS-related provisions for warranty obligations in the high three-digit million-euro range impacted the third quarter. As a result, the BMW Group adjusted its 2024 financial guidance.\n\nNevertheless, the ramp-up in e-mobility remained strong and made a positive contribution in Q3. BMW Group BEV deliveries grew significantly by +10.1% compared to the previous year, and the share of sales of fully electric vehicles rose to 19.1% percent.\n\nThe BMW Group delivered a total of 1,754,157 automobiles in the nine-month period (2023:1,836,563 automobiles/ -4.5%). In the third quarter, the premium manufacturer delivered 540,881 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles (2023: 621,699 automobiles/ -13.0%).\n\nThe BMW Group benefits from its global presence and was able to balance out the different sales developments in the major world regions. The BMW brand grew by +4% outside China and gained +0.1% points in global market share while the premium brands MINI and Rolls-Royce were affected by model changes.\n\nIn Europe, the BMW brand experienced moderate growth of +7.6% over the nine-month period. Double digit growth in individual markets such as Spain, UK, France and Italy was a key driver. Despite a notable impact of the IBS issue in the Americas region and delivery stops in the US market, BMW sales reached the previous year's level and BMW maintained a stable market share.\n\nThe company has been working hard to replace the IBS components and is expediting the processing of vehicles in customer hands and those in stock. The majority of stock vehicles requiring action will be addressed and delivered before the end of the year.\n\n“After the extraordinary challenges in the third quarter, we are looking ahead: In the fourth quarter, we are back on track for stronger earnings in order to achieve our annual targets, despite planned high upfront expenditures,” said the Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Oliver Zipse, on Wednesday. “We are striking a balance between securing short-term earnings and long-term success: This year we are investing more than ever in new products, technologies and our plants, so that we can continue the BMW success story with the NEUE KLASSE from next year onwards.”\n\nIBS-related delivery stops and delays significantly impacted the BMW Group key financial figures in the reporting period: In Q3, the BMW Group posted revenues of €32,406 million (2023: €38,458 million/ -15.7%; adjusted for currency translation effects -15.3%; Sep YTD: €105,964 million; 2023: €112,530 million/ -5.8%; adjusted for currency translation effects -4.8%).\n\nR&D spending and capital expenditure to secure future competitiveness\n\nThe BMW Group has a solid and robust balance sheet which enables continued investments in the future. As previously announced, the company expects to post peak figures for both research & development and capital expenditure in 2024.At the core is the roll-out of NEUE KLASSE across the whole portfolio focused on electrification, decarbonisation and digitalisation of its product line-up and structures.\n\nGroup research and development expenditure for the first nine months totalled €6,642 million and was significantly higher than the previous year (2023: € 5,223 million/ +27.2%; in Q3: € 2,473 million/ +35.4%). The R&D ratio of 6.3% was also higher year-on-year due to declining revenues (2023: 4.6%/+1.7 percentage points; in Q3: 7.6%; +2.8 percentage points).\n\nImpact on Group and Automotive Segment financial figures\n\nGroup operating profit (EBIT) in the third quarter was €1,696 million (Q3 2023:\n\n€4,352 million/ -61.0%; Sep YTD: €9,627 million; 2023: €14,070 million/ -31.6%). Negative fair value measurement effects resulting from falling interest rates contributed significantly to the decline in the Group financial result of €-858 million (Q3/2023: €-289 million; Sep YTD: €-766 million; 2023: €-656 million). As a result, Group earnings before tax in the third quarter declined to €838 million (€4,063 million/ -79.4%; Sep YTD: €8,861 million; 2023: €13,414 million/ -33.9%). The Group EBT margin came in at 2.6% respectively at 8.4% after nine months (Q3/ 2023: 10.6%/ -8.0%-pts.; 2023: 11.9%/ -3.5%-pts.)\n\nThe Automotive Segment posted revenues of €27,854 million (2023: €32,096 million /-13.2%;adjusted for currency translation effects -12.8%) in the third quarter (Sep YTD: €90,863 million (2023: €94,994 million/-4.3%; adjusted for currency translation effects -3.1%). Vehicle sales declined and product mix was negatively impacted – mainly due to weaker demand in China and IBS-related delivery stops of higher-class vehicle models.\n\nEarnings before financial result (EBIT) in the same reporting period totalled € 634 million (Q3 2023: €3,135 million/ -79.8%; Sep YTD: €6,028 million (2023: €9,810 million/ -38.6%). The EBIT margin decreased to 2.3% respectively to 6.6% in Sep YTD (Q3 2023: 9.8%/ -7.5 %-pts.; 2023: 10.3%/ -3.7%-pts). Excluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 3.5% for the third quarter and 7.7% for September YTD.\n\nFree cash flow impacted by capital expenditure and inventory\n\nLower earnings and increased inventory – resulting from delivery stops and lower sales volumes – had a particular impact on Q3 auto free cash flow. Working capital changed by €-1.934 million over the period and high capital expenditure of €3,311 million weighed on free cash flow. In the third quarter, it posted €-2,480 million (2023: €2,618 million; Sep YTD: €-191 million/ 2023: €5,759 million). With the release of stock vehicles following IBS exchange, the company is aiming for inventory levels at the previous year's level in the fourth quarter. Lower inventory levels and a sequentially higher result will contribute to the forecast free cash flow of >€4 billion despite further high investments.\n\n“With stringent management, the BMW Group remains on track for the forecast auto free cash flow for the full year”, said BMW Group Chief Financial Officer Walter Mertl. “In the fourth quarter, sequentially higher deliveries and a stronger product mix will support our earnings. Despite the extraordinary pressures in Q3, we are adhering to our planned extensive investments. These are the basis for our future automotive portfolio, for our profit generation in the coming years. We are committed to our future and are shaping it today with focus”, said Mertl.\n\nCapex ratio in the third quarter was 6.7%; after nine months and stood at 5.3%. A capex ratio of > 6% is expected for the year as a whole — as in previous years, the fourth quarter will also show seasonally high capital expenditure.\n\nThe BMW Group has consistently continued its share buyback program: The third tranche of the current second share buyback programwas successfully completed on October 25, 2024.\n\nBased on the authorization of the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2022, BMW AG acquired a total of 6.19% of the share capital as of September 30, 2024.\n\nFinancial Services Segment sees significant growth in new business\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the number of new financing and leasing contracts concluded in the first nine months of the year rose significantly to 1,252,251 (2023: 1,112,817 contracts/ +12.5%). The segment's volume of new business also grew significantly to €46,531 million (2023: €40,973 million/ +13.6%). The penetration rate increased to 42.3% (2023: 37.7%; +4.6 %-pts.).\n\nFor the year to the end of September, the segment reported an EBT of € 2,146 million (2023: €2,451 million/ -12.4%). Lower revenues from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, that resulted largely from the continuing normalisation of global used car markets, primarily weighed on the result. During the nine-month period, the credit loss ratio was 0.26% across the entire loan portfolio (2023: 0.15%).\n\nAdjusted guidance confirmed\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the BMW Group will continue to implement the measures outlined in the IBS technical campaigns with focus and urgency.

These targets will be achieved with slightly higher employee numbers.\n\nThis guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate. Given the many uncertainties surrounding the existing risks and opportunities, the BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from current expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group continues to fully leverage its young and attractive product portfolio and its proven approach of technology openness. Thanks to its flexibility, the balance across key global regions and a strong balance sheet, it is able to adapt to dynamic market changes while consistently pursuing its long-term business success.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: YTD Q3 2024\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEmployees (as of 31 Dec. 2023)\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues.\n\n3 Common/preferred shares.

In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.\n\nProfit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\nProfit/loss as a percentage of revenues.\n\nPlug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.\n\nReturn on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Finance Communications\n\nEckhard Wannieck, head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nIn 2023, the BMW Group sold over 2.55 million passenger vehicles and more than 209,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2023 was € 17.1 billion on revenues amounting to € 155.5 billion. As of 31 December 2023, the BMW Group had a workforce of 154,950 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action, from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

As the riders made their way through this vast and impressive reserve, they encountered various animals, including giraffes, and more, creating what felt like a true safari on GS motorcycles.\n\nThe ride proved to be extremely technical, presenting the most challenging trails encountered so far, all set against the backdrop of magnificent granite hills towering beside the road. However, whether the riders had time to enjoy the views was another matter entirely. Along the deep sandy trails, the true spirit of GS shined brightly, as riders leaped off their bikes to assist others without a second thought. This spirit of camaraderie is what the GS Trophy is all about. But to make matters more challenging, the absence of wind created extremely dusty conditions.\n\nNamibia's diverse terrain revealed itself just a few kilometers from the campsite. After navigating the technical ride, still surrounded by sand, the competitors suddenly found themselves on a massive granite rock the size of a small village, where the first special challenge of the day awaited. The solid ground provided a muchneeded break for the riders.\n\nDay 2, Special Challenge 1: The Flying Boxer. In this trial, the riders had to demonstrate their ability to pull their motorcycles from one ledge to another, simulating a real-world scenario like a fallen bridge over a canyon. A motorcycle hung mid-air, attached to a rope anchored to sturdy objects. The riders needed to sprint to the opposite end, grab two ropes, secure them to the bike, and pull it from one edge to the other, creating an incredible spectacle.\n\nRider Sunghee Kim (301) of Female Team South Korea shared, “After seeing the exercise, we decided to pull the bike with our weight. We have enough confidence that we can use our power and weight. We will also try to stand on a flat surface.” After a successful attempt, she added, “The technique we were practicing worked. We went straight for the flat part of the ledge and pulled from there. That helped a lot and we were able to complete the challenge.”.\n\nOn the way to the second Special Challenge, the riders often wondered if there was even an actual trail. Thanks to the guidance of their appointed Marshals, they arrived safely at the location for the second part of the day. Navigating through thick bushland and deep sand, the competitors continued around Ai Aiba, even crossing what seemed to be an airstrip - a long, straight stretch of hard-packed dirt that could easily be mistaken for a road. If it weren't for the helicopter supporting the medical team, one might not realize it was used as a landing strip.\n\nAgain, the competitors found themselves riding on a massive granite rock, and after tackling a very steep uphill climb, which was no problem for the R 1300 GS bikes, they arrived at the location for the second special challenge of the day.\n\nDay 2, Special Challenge 2: The SENA Rock Challenge. In this challenge, competitors had to complete a lap around a large granite rock and follow a bicycle trail back to the starting line. Each rider completed the loop, with the first rider setting a reference time for the remaining two riders (or one for the female teams). The closer the three riders crossed the finish line, the higher their score. While no timing devices were allowed, riders could use their BMW Communicator Systems to time their laps.\n\nRider Steven Ferguson (162) of Team UK explained the team’s tactic: “About this challenge, the riding part was the easiest. We had one rider counting the times of all three to try and be as similar as possible, and I had the easy job to go first, and my time was the time the other two had to match. I think we got pretty close.”\n\nThe morning concluded by closing the loop around the Ai Aiba lodge, where the riders returned for lunch before beginning the final part of their journey, heading further west towards the Spitzkoppe Lodge.\n\nRiding into the heart of Namibia. With their energy restored, the riders pushed on towards Spitzkoppe, also known as the “Matterhorn of Namibia.” This iconic group of granite peaks rises dramatically from the flat desert floor, creating a striking landmark visible from many kilometers away. The route from Ai Aiba to Spitzkoppe was entirely off-road, featuring sandy tracks, rocky outcrops, and dry riverbeds that provided a variety of challenges.\n\nUpon reaching Spitzkoppe Camp, riders had the opportunity to refuel their bikes and take in the breathtaking scenery of the surrounding area. Spitzkoppe is not only a geological marvel but also a cultural treasure, with numerous rock art sites hidden among its caves and overhangs.\n\nThe Road to Namibia conclusion. Three BMW R 1300 GS Adventure bikes began a journey from Germany, carrying the Trophies to Namibia. What better way to transport the coveted prize than on the perfect Adventure motorcycle? Nikki van der Spek, one of the riders, shared, “It was an amazing journey, with the highlight of it being the sighting of wildlife. We rode 20 meters away from rhinos, we got to see giraffes, a lot of elephants, and even lions!” When asked about the motorcycle, Vasco Santos added, “It is really impressive. If I could only use one word, it would be ‘comfort,’ especially during the extremely long riding days in Europe. We could barely realize we were on a motorcycle. The Automated Shift Assistant option had zero problems. While on the dirt, I was skeptical about it, I found out it added another layer of comfort.\n\nThe day concluded with a sense of accomplishment as riders settled in for the night under a full moon, surrounded by one of Namibia's most iconic landscapes.\n\nRider Fernando Dias (103) of Team Brazil: “I really liked this day. I prefer riding this terrain. It was not so hard for me. Team Brazil did really well today and we’re very satisfied.”\n\nRider Francisco Leyva (112) of Team Mexico: “It was an amazing day. It started a little bit rough with the deep sand, but as the day progressed, we felt better and better with every kilometer.

Each rider completed the loop, with the first rider setting a reference time for the remaining two riders (or one for the female teams). The closer the three riders crossed the finish line, the higher their score. While no timing devices were allowed, riders could use their BMW Communicator Systems to time their laps.\n\nRider Steven Ferguson (162) of Team UK explained the team’s tactic: “About this challenge, the riding part was the easiest. We had one rider counting the times of all three to try and be as similar as possible, and I had the easy job to go first, and my time was the time the other two had to match. I think we got pretty close.”\n\nThe morning concluded by closing the loop around the Ai Aiba lodge, where the riders returned for lunch before beginning the final part of their journey, heading further west towards the Spitzkoppe Lodge.\n\nRiding into the heart of Namibia. With their energy restored, the riders pushed on towards Spitzkoppe, also known as the “Matterhorn of Namibia.” This iconic group of granite peaks rises dramatically from the flat desert floor, creating a striking landmark visible from many kilometers away. The route from Ai Aiba to Spitzkoppe was entirely off-road, featuring sandy tracks, rocky outcrops, and dry riverbeds that provided a variety of challenges.\n\nUpon reaching Spitzkoppe Camp, riders had the opportunity to refuel their bikes and take in the breathtaking scenery of the surrounding area. Spitzkoppe is not only a geological marvel but also a cultural treasure, with numerous rock art sites hidden among its caves and overhangs.\n\nThe Road to Namibia conclusion. Three BMW R 1300 GS Adventure bikes began a journey from Germany, carrying the Trophies to Namibia. What better way to transport the coveted prize than on the perfect Adventure motorcycle? Nikki van der Spek, one of the riders, shared, “It was an amazing journey, with the highlight of it being the sighting of wildlife. We rode 20 meters away from rhinos, we got to see giraffes, a lot of elephants, and even lions!” When asked about the motorcycle, Vasco Santos added, “It is really impressive. If I could only use one word, it would be ‘comfort,’ especially during the extremely long riding days in Europe. We could barely realize we were on a motorcycle. The Automated Shift Assistant option had zero problems. While on the dirt, I was skeptical about it, I found out it added another layer of comfort.\n\nThe day concluded with a sense of accomplishment as riders settled in for the night under a full moon, surrounded by one of Namibia's most iconic landscapes.\n\nRider Fernando Dias (103) of Team Brazil: “I really liked this day. I prefer riding this terrain. It was not so hard for me. Team Brazil did really well today and we’re very satisfied.”\n\nRider Francisco Leyva (112) of Team Mexico: “It was an amazing day. It started a little bit rough with the deep sand, but as the day progressed, we felt better and better with every kilometer. We kept a nice pace, and we had a great time.”\n\nBMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024, Namibia.\n\nDay Two overall standings:\n\n5.

There was also plenty of reason for joy in numerous other racing series worldwide. The BMW Italia Ceccato Racing team impressively continued its successful streak in the Italian GT Championship with the BMW M4 GT3. In North America, things did not go as well as usual, but we were able to witness strong results of the BMW M4 GT4 in Asia and Australia. I congratulate all participants! Off the racetrack, our highlight was the presentation of the EVO models of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 at the Nürburgring. We look forward to being able to provide more details about the new BMW M4 GT4 model in just a few weeks on the sidelines of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps.\"\n\nItalian GT Championship (1st-2nd June): Podium for Klingmann/Dennis at Imola.\n\nThe Italian GT Championship visited Imola (ITA) for the second round of the Sprint Cup at the beginning of the month. There was a change in the line-up of BMW M works drivers for the Team BMW Italia Ceccato Racing #7 BMW M4 GT3 as Max Hesse (GER) was simultaneously competing in the 24h Nürburgring (GER), Jake Dennis (GBR) shared the cockpit with Jens Klingmann (GER) at Imola. The duo was successful in the second of the two races when Klingmann and Dennis finished second on the podium. The first run was difficult for the two, ending in 17th place. After contact, Klingmann had to make an unscheduled pitstop to change a tyre during the second stint.\n\nThe weekend was also successful for Pedro Ebrahim (BRA) and Federico Malvestiti (ITA), who compete in the Pro-Am class with the #8 BMW M4 GT3. In the first run on Saturday, they secured third place in their category. On Sunday, the duo then celebrated their second class win of the season.\n\nJapan Cup (8th-9th June): Opening victory for the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nAt the first race weekend of the Japan Cup at Sportsland SUGO (JPN) the YZ Racing team, with the #50 BMW M4 GT4 and drivers Yuki Fujii and Masaki Kano (both JPN), won the opening race. In the second run, the duo finished in third place and thus took the lead in the overall standings.\n\nIMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge (8th-9th June): Endurance race in Mid-Ohio.\n\nThe second 4-hour race of the season in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge took place at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course (USA) last weekend, however without the hoped-for podium successes for the BMW M Motorsport teams. The highest-placed crew was Turner Motorsport with the #95 BMW M4 GT4 and drivers Dillon Machavern and Robert Megennis (both USA) finishing in sixth place. In total, five BMW M4 GT4s were on the starting grid.\n\nAlso in Mid-Ohio, the VP Racing SportsCar Challenge held two races in which five BMW M4 GT4s competed. In the Split Decision Motorsports #88 car, Patrick Wilmot (USA) narrowly missed the podium in the GSX class, finishing fourth in both races.\n\nBritish GT Championship (25th-26th May): BMW M4 GT3 in the top six at Donington.\n\nAt the third round of the British GT Championship at Donington Park (GBR), there was a top-six finish for the BMW M4 GT3. BMW M works driver Dan Harper (GBR) and his teammate Michael Johnston (GBR) finished sixth in the Century Motorsport #14 car.\n\nTheir teammates Lewis Plato and Carl Cavers (both GBR) finished twelfth in the #22 BMW M4 GT3. That was equivalent to fourth place in the GT3SA class. BMW M works driver Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and his driving colleague John Ferguson (GBR) saw the checkered flag in the #15 BMW M4 GT3 from Team RAM Racing in 17th place. In the GT4PA class, Ian Gough and Tom Wrigley (both GBR) in the Century Motorsport #29 BMW M4 GT4 finished fourth.\n\nSuper GT Series (1st-2nd June): Endurance race at Suzuka.\n\nAt the third season round of the Japanese Super GT Series at Suzuka (JPN), another endurance race was held. Team Studie was again supported by BMW M works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN). In the #7 BMW M4 GT3, he alternated with Niklas Krütten (GER) and Seiji Ara (JPN). The trio started from eighth on the grid and crossed the finish line in seventh place after 85 laps.\n\nGT4 Australia (1st-2nd June): BMW M4 GT4 successful in Australia.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 is also successful down under, namely in GT4 Australia. There, the BMW M Motorsport teams are regular guests on the various podiums. That was also the case at the second season round at the beginning of the month at The Bend Motorsport Park near Adelaide (AUS). The highest-placed BMW M Motorsport driver in both races was Tim Leahey (AUS) in the #22 BMW M4 GT4 from Team Central West Prestige. In the first race, he finished third in the highest class, the Silver category. In the second race, he narrowly missed the podium with fourth in his class.\n\nTwo class victories were celebrated by Jacob Lawrence (AUS) in the #32 car from Randall Racing in the Am category. In addition, there was a third place on the class podium for the #3 BMW M4 GT4 from Thunder Buddies Racing, driven by Ryder Quinn and Steve Jakic (both AUS / Pro-Am), as well as the #33 car from Randall Racing (Am), in which Jamie Augustine and Peter Lawrence (both AUS) took turns.\n\nBTCC (25th-26th May / 8th-9th June): Victories at Snetterton and Thruxton.\n\nTwo events were on the schedule in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in recent weeks. At the end of May, it was the third season round at Snetterton (GBR), and last weekend, round four followed at Thruxton (GBR). BMW drivers were once again extremely successful.\n\nAt Snetterton, Jake Hill (GBR) from Team Laser Tools Racing with MB Motorsport crowned himself \"King of the Hill\". He defied the very changeable weather conditions and was the star of the weekend. With the #24 BMW 330e M Sport, Hill was not only the fastest in qualifying but also won the first two of the three races. Not even a time penalty prevented him from reaching the finish with a large lead. In the third run, which became a tyre lottery due to drying track conditions, Hill led the field for a long time on rain tyres, but then the competition on slicks had the advantage, and he finished ninth in the end. Teammate Bobby Thompson (GBR) completed a BMW one-two result in the first race, finishing second in the #19 car on the podium.\n\nAt Thruxton, Hill repeated the feat of winning the first two of the three races. That gave him four victories from the last six races. In the third race of the day, Hill managed fifth place, which with 164 points now puts him in second place in the drivers' standings – just five points behind the leader. There were no more podium places for the BMW teams at Thruxton. Adam Morgan (GBR) finished fourth in the last race and twice in eighth place before that. Colin Turkington was twice seventh and once ninth. He is in fourth place in the drivers' standings."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In our BMW M Motorsport News, we regularly offer you a selection of photos as well as a compact and informative overview of the racing action in various championships worldwide and the successes of the BMW M Motorsport teams."}]}

The highest-placed crew was Turner Motorsport with the #95 BMW M4 GT4 and drivers Dillon Machavern and Robert Megennis (both USA) finishing in sixth place. In total, five BMW M4 GT4s were on the starting grid.\n\nAlso in Mid-Ohio, the VP Racing SportsCar Challenge held two races in which five BMW M4 GT4s competed. In the Split Decision Motorsports #88 car, Patrick Wilmot (USA) narrowly missed the podium in the GSX class, finishing fourth in both races.\n\nBritish GT Championship (25th-26th May): BMW M4 GT3 in the top six at Donington.\n\nAt the third round of the British GT Championship at Donington Park (GBR), there was a top-six finish for the BMW M4 GT3. BMW M works driver Dan Harper (GBR) and his teammate Michael Johnston (GBR) finished sixth in the Century Motorsport #14 car.\n\nTheir teammates Lewis Plato and Carl Cavers (both GBR) finished twelfth in the #22 BMW M4 GT3. That was equivalent to fourth place in the GT3SA class. BMW M works driver Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and his driving colleague John Ferguson (GBR) saw the checkered flag in the #15 BMW M4 GT3 from Team RAM Racing in 17th place. In the GT4PA class, Ian Gough and Tom Wrigley (both GBR) in the Century Motorsport #29 BMW M4 GT4 finished fourth.\n\nSuper GT Series (1st-2nd June): Endurance race at Suzuka.\n\nAt the third season round of the Japanese Super GT Series at Suzuka (JPN), another endurance race was held.

The trio started from eighth on the grid and crossed the finish line in seventh place after 85 laps.\n\nGT4 Australia (1st-2nd June): BMW M4 GT4 successful in Australia.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 is also successful down under, namely in GT4 Australia. There, the BMW M Motorsport teams are regular guests on the various podiums. That was also the case at the second season round at the beginning of the month at The Bend Motorsport Park near Adelaide (AUS). The highest-placed BMW M Motorsport driver in both races was Tim Leahey (AUS) in the #22 BMW M4 GT4 from Team Central West Prestige. In the first race, he finished third in the highest class, the Silver category. In the second race, he narrowly missed the podium with fourth in his class.\n\nTwo class victories were celebrated by Jacob Lawrence (AUS) in the #32 car from Randall Racing in the Am category.

BMW drivers were once again extremely successful.\n\nAt Snetterton, Jake Hill (GBR) from Team Laser Tools Racing with MB Motorsport crowned himself \"King of the Hill\". He defied the very changeable weather conditions and was the star of the weekend. With the #24 BMW 330e M Sport, Hill was not only the fastest in qualifying but also won the first two of the three races. Not even a time penalty prevented him from reaching the finish with a large lead. In the third run, which became a tyre lottery due to drying track conditions, Hill led the field for a long time on rain tyres, but then the competition on slicks had the advantage, and he finished ninth in the end. Teammate Bobby Thompson (GBR) completed a BMW one-two result in the first race, finishing second in the #19 car on the podium.\n\nAt Thruxton, Hill repeated the feat of winning the first two of the three races. That gave him four victories from the last six races. In the third race of the day, Hill managed fifth place, which with 164 points now puts him in second place in the drivers' standings – just five points behind the leader. There were no more podium places for the BMW teams at Thruxton. Adam Morgan (GBR) finished fourth in the last race and twice in eighth place before that. Colin Turkington was twice seventh and once ninth. He is in fourth place in the drivers' standings."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport News, 11th June 2024."}]}

The preliminary final results of the Straßkirchen referendum are in: A clear majority of Straßkirchen residents voted in favour of building the new BMW Group facility.

Around 77 percent of the citizens voted.\n\n“The people of Straßkirchen have voted for a joint future with the BMW Group. We are taking advantage here in Bavaria of the opportunities offered by the transformation towards electromobility,” said Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production.

All in all, this, today, sends an important signal for Germany as a whole as a location for industry.”\n\nThe next step on the road to plant construction will already take place in October. The local land-use planning process provides for a second round of public consultation on the construction project, where the BMW Group will also present the many expert opinions it has commissioned on the impact of site development.\n\nJobs and apprenticeships geared towards the future\n\nUpon completion of the initial construction phase, the BMW Group plans to employ around 1,600 people at the future production site. About 70 percent will come from existing BMW Group locations; these employees will be able to share their know-how during construction of the new site. Around 7,500 BMW Group employees already live within a 20-kilometre radius of the planned location. In cooperation with Plant Dingolfing, the BMW Group will also offer about 50 apprenticeships at the planned site.\n\nReliable source of business tax\n\nThe BMW Group has already registered permanent establishments in the municipalities of Straßkirchen and Irlbach and has therefore been subject to business tax since August of this year – regardless of construction of the plant.

Among these candidates, the municipalities of Straßkirchen and Irlbach were preferred over other available spaces in a multi-stage process. The decisive criteria included proximity to the BMW Group's Bavarian car plants, exclusion of nature reserves, water protection areas and forests, the size and shape of the plot, combined with a flat topography, and the fact that several thousand employees already live in the immediate vicinity of the site. After careful consideration, the possibility of embedding battery assembly within existing plant sites was ruled out, due to a lack of sufficient space for the required scope.\n\nIn February 2023, the BMW Group acquired a plot of 105 hectares in the municipal areas of Straßkirchen and Irlbach. The company also has purchase rights for approx. 29 additional hectares of adjacent land. This option area is currently managed by the respective owners.\n\nSite to play key role in securing Bavaria’s future status as a car-building location\n\nMore than 36,000 people in Bavaria are currently employed at the vehicle plants in Munich, Dingolfing and Regensburg alone. The planned location will secure the future of these plants, by supplying them with the decisive component for electromobility: the high-voltage battery. This will not only safeguard existing jobs at the BMW Group’s car plants in Bavaria, but also create new jobs in the innovative field of e-mobility.\n\nThe BMW Group’s choice of location will also protect important jobs outside of the company and create new ones.

The prototypes are carefully disguised, but they cannot conceal their character as high-performance cars. The future generation of the BMW M5 has entered the practical phase of its series development process. The new high-performance sedan from BMW M GmbH is now completing its test drives on public roads, BMW Group proving grounds and racetracks around the world.\n\nMoreover, fans of the BMW M brand can look forward to a further result of the product offensive that will continue into the year 2024. BMW M GmbH has now officially confirmed that with the new edition of the BMW M5, it will be adding a Touring variant to its model range. The perfect symbiosis of M-typical performance, uncompromising long-distance comfort and impressive spaciousness will experience a renaissance in 2024 with the new BMW M5 Touring.\n\nJust like the future BMW M5 Sedan, the Touring variant will also feature a completely newly developed partially electrified drive system. Its M-typical performance characteristics as well as the precisely tuned chassis technology refined with innovative systems facilitate driving dynamics and agility at a level unique in this vehicle class. Thus, BMW M GmbH is steadily progressing on its path to electrification. \"We are now also installing a hybrid drive system with typical M performance in other high-performance cars,\" says Dirk Häcker, Head of Development at BMW M GmbH.\n\nFor almost 40 years now, the BMW M5 has been the benchmark for driving dynamics, agility and precision in the high-performance sedan segment. Evolutionary progress, development know-how from racing and pioneering innovations in the areas of drive, suspension, aerodynamics and lightweight construction have shaped the history of the BMW M5. Engines with six, eight and ten cylinders, M TwinPower Turbo technology and high-revving characteristics, the compound brake system with M Carbon ceramic brakes and M xDrive four-wheel drive are just some of the technological milestones with which this model has repeatedly redefined top performance in a sedan that is unconditionally suitable for everyday use. The seventh generation of the BMW M5 takes up on this – with fascinating innovations for an even more intense performance experience.\n\nThe first BMW M5 Touring was launched back in 1992 based on the second-generation BMW M5 Sedan and has since stood for a combination of high performance and everyday practicality on four wheels.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at summarizing BMW news articles. Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nA defining element of the digital user experience in the new #BMW iX3 is BMW Panoramic iDrive, which elevates intuitive operation and the driver focus for which the brand is renowned to a new level. And an all-encompassing sustainability concept reduces the car’s product carbon footprint over its life cycle by more than 30 per cent compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe first Neue Klasse model will be built at the newly constructed BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The first variant of the fully electric SAV to roll off the production line from autumn 2025 will be the BMW iX3 50 xDrive (electric power consumption, combined: 17.9 – 15.1 kWh/100 km; CO2 class: A; range: 679 – 805 km [421 – 500 miles]; provisional figures as per WLTP) with an output of 345 kW/469 hp and electric all-wheel drive. Further fully electric variants will follow, including an entry-level model. The market launch of the new BMW iX3 will get underway in Europe in spring 2026 and in the USA in summer 2026. Also starting in summer 2026 will be deliveries of a variant of the new BMW iX3 produced at the Shenyang facility that has been tailored specifically to the needs and desires of customers in China.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 represents a leap forward in development over its predecessor of the same name that extends well beyond the reaches of a conventional model renewal. The advances made in terms of design and technology create the impression that a complete vehicle generation has been skipped. For the BMW Group, the launch of the new BMW iX3 also represents a milestone in the transformation process when it comes to electrification, digitalisation and circularity. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, it offers customers the latest design and technology innovations, which will shape the brand’s entire model range moving forwards. The technologies of the Neue Klasse will be incorporated into a total of 40 new models and model updates between now and 2027.\n\n“The Neue Klasse is our biggest future project and marks a huge leap in terms of technologies, driving experience and design,” says Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “Practically everything about it is new, yet it is also more BMW than ever. Our entire product range will benefit from the innovations of the Neue Klasse – regardless of the drive technology. What started as a bold vision has now become reality: the BMW iX3 is the first Neue Klasse model to go into series production. We are not only bringing the next generation of one of our most successful fully electric vehicles onto the road, we are launching a new era for BMW.”\n\nLaunch of the new design language: reduced, characterful and timeless.\n\nMajor technological advances always offer an opportunity to introduce more significant design changes. The new BMW iX3 will launch the new BMW design language, which will be replicated across the whole of the brand’s model range in due course. This new use of forms provides a very modern interpretation of BMW’s original and enduring blueprint. The design is timeless while also capturing the prevailing zeitgeist. It is reduced to the essence of the BMW brand – and therefore more BMW than ever. For this one reason why comprehensive design protection has been registered for the new BMW design language used in the new BMW iX3.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 showcases the values and qualities of the Neue Klasse within the template of an SAV. The first BMW X model of the new generation is all about interior space and a progressive lifestyle. At 4,782 millimetres in length, 1,895 millimetres wide and 1,635 millimetres tall, the new BMW iX3 has the hallmark proportions of an SAV. The characteristic two-box design is infused with the rugged presence of a BMW X model and has precise lines that emphasise all four wheels. Detail optimisation of the car’s aerodynamics enables a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.24.\n\nThe load compartment capacity of the new BMW iX3 can be increased from 520 to a maximum 1,750 litres by folding down the rear seat backrest elements as required. The additional storage compartment under the bonnet can hold another 58 litres of cargo. Customers needing additional transportation capacity can specify their car with the optional electric fold-in/fold-out trailer tow hitch. The maximum trailer load of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive is 2,000 kilograms.\n\nThe upright front end and clearly formed surfaces endows the new BMW iX3 with considerable presence. The BMW kidneys and twin headlights – both distinctive BMW design cues – take centre stage visually. The sculpted BMW kidneys reference the Neue Klasse of the 1960s in their vertical arrangement. An all-new light signature assumes the role previously performed by chrome in giving the car an aura of quality and sophistication. And when viewed from the side, large surfaces broken up by a small number of precise lines create a character-rich appearance. Flush glass surfaces and door handles are also features of the side view. The robust stature of the new BMW iX3 is underscored by body-colour wheel arches with – in familiar BMW X model style – subtly rectangular contours. The rear end also cuts a powerful and athletic figure. The taillights extending well into the centre of the rear end represent a horizontal interpretation of the signature BMW “L” shape.\n\nInterior design: modern space has a BMW-typical driver focus and offers exceptional comfort for all passengers.\n\nThe design of the BMW iX3 interior sets new standards in terms of modernity and digital experience. The interior has an uncluttered, reduced design, providing the ideal stage for the digital experience. The cabin is all about the clear driver focus for which BMW is renowned and comfort for all those on board. Created specifically for electric vehicles, the vehicle architecture allows for extremely generous levels of space in all five seats. The lines of the “floating” instrument panel flow directly into the large door trim panels, creating an enveloping wrap-around effect for the passengers. With its fabric surface, the instrument panel – with atmospheric backlighting – contributes to the warm and inviting atmosphere inside. Large window surfaces and the optional panoramic sunroof with climate comfort glazing generate an ambience bathed in light.\n\nAnother prominent influence in the horizontally arranged cockpit is the new control/operation system BMW Panoramic iDrive, which is based on the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X. It brings together displays, geometry and light & sound design into a holistic experience, customisable via the My Modes. Also playing a role here are the new driving sounds, sound effects and sound signals of the BMW HypersonX soundscape created specifically for the Neue Klasse.\n\nThe elegantly minimalist seats of the new design stand out with their excellent comfort levels over long journeys, sporty character, and wide range of adjustment. Also sporting an all-new design are the steering wheel and the centre console between the driver’s seat and front passenger seat, complete with storage areas and control elements. The rear seat bench offers a single, sofa-like seat surface.\n\nPrecisely arranged interior worlds bring a unique and thoroughly distinct character to every equipment package. The materials and colour schemes selected are inspired by modern interior design and advanced Neue Klasse technology, and coordinated harmoniously with one another. They therefore make a noticeable, visible contribution to the exceptional comfort levels on board the new BMW iX3. An attractive range of colours enables a perfect match between the interior tones and exterior paint finishes. As alternatives to the standard-specification Essential interior design in Vivid Grey with Econeer seat coverings, customers can also choose from three other compositions in Veganza, the black BMW M interior world in Veganza and M PerformTex, and the BMW Individual option with a high-quality Merino leather/M PerformTex combination in Black Bicolour or Adelaide Grey.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 can be specified as an option with the M Sport package or M Sport package Pro from launch. Its dynamic looks are further emphasised by Black high-gloss features for the exterior, and M Sport seats and an M steering wheel inside the car.\n\nThe BMW Iconic Glow exterior package enables an impressive sound and light sequence with Relaxed, Balanced and Excited styles. The welcome sequence commences as soon as the driver approaches the vehicle and, as they take their seat, an animated greeting begins in the BMW Panoramic Vision and Central Display, spreading smoothly from the driver’s side of the cockpit to the front passenger side.\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive: consummate driver focus, BMW-style.\n\nThe BMW iX3 is the first series-produced model in which BMW Panoramic iDrive redefines the user experience and therefore also Sheer Driving Pleasure. With its neatly judged balance between digital functions and physical elements, BMW Panoramic iDrive elevates intuitive operation – according to BMW’s fabled “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” principle – to a new level of driver focus. The entire system is born out of decades of experience and a user-centric design approach. Individual customer feedback, data from over 10 million connected vehicles and usability studies with more than 3,000 customers were all incorporated into the development process. Physical controls are on hand, including for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selector, parking brake, hazard warning lights, rear window heating and defrost function. Other functions have been optimised for use by touch and voice command or via the multifunction steering wheel.\n\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has been significantly upgraded and now includes two new voices, a new appearance for the BMW Panoramic Vision and additional assistance for the driver through proactive suggestions and personalisable routines. Large Language Model (LLM) technology will also be gradually introduced to enable even more intuitive voice interaction in the future.\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive brings four central elements together into a unique display and control/operation system. The BMW Panoramic Vision projects information across the full width of the windscreen, from A-pillar to A-pillar. The content in the centre and on the front passenger side can be adapted to personal tastes and requirements. Key driving information appears in the driver’s field of vision. And above the BMW Panoramic Vision, the BMW 3D Head-Up Display (if specified) can now also show integrated navigation and automated driving displays on the road with spatial depth. The free-cut-design Central Display with matrix backlight technology is located in an ergonomically ideal position next to the steering wheel. On the driver’s side, vertically arranged widgets enable fast and direct access to particularly frequently used functions using QuickSelect tech. The new multifunction steering wheel serves as the primary physical control point. Its button panels help the driver and vehicle to work together symbiotically using illuminations, a relief-like surface and haptic feedback.\n\nUnderpinning BMW Panoramic iDrive is the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X, which offers extensive scope for personalisation via the BMW ID, intelligent driver assistance, a wide variety of digital functions, extensive connectivity using the My BMW App and outstanding future-proofing thanks to BMW Software Updates.\n\nThe standard-fit navigation system BMW Maps features an upgrade for the charging-optimised route guidance, plus intelligently coordinated presentation of information on the BMW Panoramic Vision, Central Display and optional 3D Head-Up Display. The BMW Digital Key Plus can be set up on smartphones and smartwatches from all the leading makers, also as standard. Meanwhile, BMW Operating System X unlocks a wide variety of entertainment while on the road and during charging stops, bringing customers not only music streaming apps such as Spotify and in-car gaming with AirConsole, but also a video-streaming app offering Disney+, YouTube and other international/numerous country-specific on-demand and live video platforms. The Zoom App for video calls is now also available for use.\n\nThe BMW ConnectedDrive Store provides an overview of the features customers can currently download or access, and these can be added easily and flexibly through ConnectedDrive Upgrades. For example, more than 60 third-party apps in the music & audio, entertainment, gaming, news, and travel & local categories are available worldwide. To download the features and use the apps, customers will need access to connectivity via BMW Digital Premium or a WiFi network/smartphone hotspot. The BMW Digital Premium range of features customers can add as they desire comprises extensive safety functions, extended navigation features, unlimited data for entertainment and now also BMW M Apps.\n\nSixth-generation BMW eDrive technology: higher efficiency, more range, faster charging.\n\nThe sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the Neue Klasse comprises highly efficient electric motors, fundamentally new high-voltage batteries with cylindrical cells, and 800V technology. The BMW iX3 50 xDrive is powered by two electric motors, which together generate output of 345 kW/469 hp and 645 Nm (475 lb-ft) of torque. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (130 mph). Its electric all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) with particularly high levels of efficiency at the rear axle and, at the front axle, a new asynchronous motor (ASM) distinguished by its compact design and high cost efficiency. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of the BMW Group’s commitment to technological neutrality within electric mobility as well. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse reduces energy losses by 40 per cent compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10 per cent and manufacturing costs by 20 per cent.\n\nThe new high-voltage battery concept with cylindrical cells for the Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on a cell level is 20 per cent higher than with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and the new concept also paves the way for a 30 per cent increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a structural component to minimise weight (“pack to open body”). The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has a usable energy content of 108.7 kWh, enabling a range of up to 805 kilometres (500 miles) in the WLTP cycle.\n\nBMW Charging: short charging times, premiere for bidirectional charging.\n\nThe advances brought by sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology have a significant influence on the charging experience, too. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables users to fill their new BMW iX3 with enough energy at an 800V direct current (DC) rapid charging station to add up to 372 kilometres (231 miles)[1] of range in just ten minutes. The high-voltage battery can charge from 10 to 80 per cent capacity in 21 minutes. Thanks to the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed completely in-house by the BMW Group, the new BMW iX3 can also be charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation also help to shorten charging times. The new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can top up on alternating current (AC) at 11 kW as standard or 22 kW[2] as an option.\n\nExtensive bidirectional charging functions[3] are also available for the new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an energy supply source for a variety of applications. The Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power while on the move. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) hands it the role of storage unit for solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems. And customers can also hook their car up to the energy market via the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) application and earn some money in the process.\n\nThe selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a journey, customers can make use of the new Multifunction Charger, which comes with several adapters for charging and discharging the high-voltage battery. The new BMW Wallbox Professional (DC) enables bidirectional charging at home or work. And BMW Charging offers the option of cost-optimised /solar-power-optimised home charging. Emblematic of the charging experience in this new vehicle generation is the intelligent charging flap of the new BMW iX3, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the customer’s intention to top up their car and then automatically opens or closes. And sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology makes it possible to view the current charging speed and curve in the My BMW App. Up to ten individual charging contracts from various suppliers can be shown digitally inside the new BMW iX3, enabling use of the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function.\n\nHeart of Joy: Sheer Driving Pleasure reaches a new level.\n\nOne of four “superbrains” in the electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation and steering subfunctions, and processes information up to ten times faster than conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power transfer, agility, stability and efficiency is utilised to the full.\n\nTogether with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. Here, the decades of experience of BMW in the field of driving dynamics control come to the fore. The driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely harmonious and BMW-typical driving feeling whatever the situation and speed. Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal and steering is executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimised by the integrated management of drivetrain, braking system and energy recuperation. In everyday driving, 98 per cent of braking manoeuvres are carried out using recuperation only, i.e. without application of the friction brakes.\n\n“Superbrain of automated driving” for the driver assistance systems with new-generation technology.\n\nAnother high-performance computer brings together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW iX3. With 20 times greater processing power than conventional control units, the “superbrain of automated driving” enables a significant technological advance with the Neue Klasse in this area as well.\n\nBMW Symbiotic Drive provides seamless support. The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake or steer, their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled software.\n\nThe result is a whole new form of Sheer Driving Pleasure. These driver assistance functions are generally already included as standard with entry-level specification. For example, the automatic cruise control system is not deactivated with only a light press of the brake pedal; instead, it is only switched off when the driver brakes harder. In the same way, the lane control assistance remains active even after a small steering input by the driver.\n\nThe further-developed BMW motorway assistant supports BMW iX3 drivers from the moment they join a motorway until they leave it, and allows them to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods. The functionality offered by the City Assistant includes traffic light detection, where the car automatically stops and then moves off again.\n\nNew electronics architecture with four “superbrains”.\n\nThe completely newly developed electronics architecture comprises a total of four high-performance computers known as “superbrains”. They pool their processing power for driving dynamics, automated driving, infotainment and basic & comfort-enhancing functions. They also provide the basis for a new software architecture that can be continuously upgraded and is therefore designed to incorporate upcoming function updates including AI features.\n\nThe new digital nervous system consists of a wiring harness divided into four zones. This reduces weight by 30 per cent compared to the technology used previously and allows for around 600 metres less wiring. Another new feature are digital “smart eFuses”, which replace classical safety fuses. They enable intelligent power modes for different vehicle states that help to improve the car’s overall efficiency.\n\nWith its four superbrains and highly connected software platforms, the BMW iX3 is a true software-defined vehicle and exceptionally well equipped for the future. Added to which, the new electronics architecture forms the basis for multifaceted improvements in the networking of the BMW iX3 with the My BMW App. This new level of quality when it comes to integration delivers new experiences and holds considerable potential for future innovations.\n\nEquipment and individualisation to enhance driving pleasure, comfort and versatility.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 will be available with one solid and five metallic paint finishes from launch. As an alternative to the 20-inch light-alloy wheels fitted as standard, customers can also browse an exclusive selection of new light-alloy wheels (20-, 21- and 22-inch) available as an option. The range also includes BMW M and BMW Individual light-alloy wheels, some in aerodynamically and weight-optimised Air Performance specification.\n\nCustomers can tailor the design of the cabin to their personal style with the help of the Essential, Contemporary, M Sport and BMW Individual interior design worlds. The driver’s seat and front passenger seat are heated and electrically adjustable as standard. M Sport seats and multifunction seats are available as options. Also on the options list are a sports steering wheel and an M Sport steering wheel.\n\nStandard specification for the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive also includes two-zone automatic climate control, Comfort Access, automatic tailgate operation, the extended exterior mirror package, an alarm system and the telephony with wireless charging function. Among the other highlights of the optional equipment offering are three-zone automatic climate control, adaptive headlight functions with intelligent light control, the BMW Iconic Glow package including illuminated BMW kidneys, the Harman Kardon HiFi system with 13 speakers, steering wheel heating and a large panoramic sunroof, whose climate comfort glazing has unique solar energy filtering and 100-per cent UV protection.\n\nHolistic sustainability approach targeting circularity and CO2e reduction .\n\nThe BMW Group kicked off the development of its upcoming vehicle generation by intensifying its efforts to systematically implement “Design for Circularity” principles and further reduce CO2e emissions throughout the product life cycle. A holistic sustainability approach has therefore been applied for the new BMW iX3.\n\nA variety of measures ensures that the product carbon footprint of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive over its full life cycle – based on a mileage of 200,000 kilometres (124,260 miles) – is 34 per cent smaller than that of its predecessor. This means that, when charged with electricity from the European energy mix, it has a smaller product carbon footprint than a comparable combustion-engined (ICE) model after around 21,500 kilometres (13,358 miles). When charged exclusively with electricity from renewable sources, the BMW iX3 50 xDrive beats the comparable ICE model after only 17,500 kilometres (10,873 miles, WLTP combined), allowing customers to potentially achieve CO₂e advantages over the ICE model in as little as one year.\n\nAround one third of the new BMW iX3 is made from secondary raw materials. For example, the storage compartment under the front hatch and the engine compartment cover are made from 30 per cent[4] recycled marine plastic. The base material of the yarn for the Econeer seat textile, the headliner (textile) and the floor-mat carpet is made from 100 per cent[5] recycled PET. When it comes to the car’s chassis, aluminium consisting of 80 per cent secondary raw material is used for the swivel bearings and hub carriers, while the wheel rims are cast from aluminium with a 70 per cent secondary raw material content.\n\nThe overall product carbon footprint of the supply chain for the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has been reduced by 35 per cent. Production and operations at BMW Group Plant Debrecen do not use fossil fuels in normal operating conditions. And thanks to sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology and other BMW EfficientDynamics measures, the energy consumption of the new BMW iX3 is 20 per cent lower than that of the predecessor model (WLTP combined).\n\n[1] The added range after ten minutes of high-power charging was determined in accordance with ISO12906 in the WLTP cycle. This and the charging performance depend on the vehicle specification, battery charge, condition and temperature, individual driving profile, use of auxiliary consumers, ambient temperature and the charging power provided by the charging point.\n\n[2] Available from production period 3/2026.\n\n[3] Available from production period 3/2026.\n\n[4] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\n[5] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\n[6] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW presents the first series-produced Neue Klasse model.

The new-generation BMW iX3 is a fully electric Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) that gives customers their first on-the-road taste of a whole new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure. An all-new design language gives the car a character-rich appearance that faithfully conveys the technological progress made by the new model.

And an all-encompassing sustainability concept reduces the car’s product carbon footprint over its life cycle by more than 30 per cent compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe first Neue Klasse model will be built at the newly constructed BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The first variant of the fully electric SAV to roll off the production line from autumn 2025 will be the BMW iX3 50 xDrive (electric power consumption, combined: 17.9 – 15.1 kWh/100 km; CO2 class: A; range: 679 – 805 km [421 – 500 miles]; provisional figures as per WLTP) with an output of 345 kW/469 hp and electric all-wheel drive. Further fully electric variants will follow, including an entry-level model. The market launch of the new BMW iX3 will get underway in Europe in spring 2026 and in the USA in summer 2026. Also starting in summer 2026 will be deliveries of a variant of the new BMW iX3 produced at the Shenyang facility that has been tailored specifically to the needs and desires of customers in China.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 represents a leap forward in development over its predecessor of the same name that extends well beyond the reaches of a conventional model renewal. The advances made in terms of design and technology create the impression that a complete vehicle generation has been skipped. For the BMW Group, the launch of the new BMW iX3 also represents a milestone in the transformation process when it comes to electrification, digitalisation and circularity. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, it offers customers the latest design and technology innovations, which will shape the brand’s entire model range moving forwards. The technologies of the Neue Klasse will be incorporated into a total of 40 new models and model updates between now and 2027.\n\n“The Neue Klasse is our biggest future project and marks a huge leap in terms of technologies, driving experience and design,” says Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “Practically everything about it is new, yet it is also more BMW than ever. Our entire product range will benefit from the innovations of the Neue Klasse – regardless of the drive technology. What started as a bold vision has now become reality: the BMW iX3 is the first Neue Klasse model to go into series production. We are not only bringing the next generation of one of our most successful fully electric vehicles onto the road, we are launching a new era for BMW.”\n\nLaunch of the new design language: reduced, characterful and timeless.\n\nMajor technological advances always offer an opportunity to introduce more significant design changes. The new BMW iX3 will launch the new BMW design language, which will be replicated across the whole of the brand’s model range in due course. This new use of forms provides a very modern interpretation of BMW’s original and enduring blueprint. The design is timeless while also capturing the prevailing zeitgeist. It is reduced to the essence of the BMW brand – and therefore more BMW than ever. For this one reason why comprehensive design protection has been registered for the new BMW design language used in the new BMW iX3.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 showcases the values and qualities of the Neue Klasse within the template of an SAV. The first BMW X model of the new generation is all about interior space and a progressive lifestyle. At 4,782 millimetres in length, 1,895 millimetres wide and 1,635 millimetres tall, the new BMW iX3 has the hallmark proportions of an SAV. The characteristic two-box design is infused with the rugged presence of a BMW X model and has precise lines that emphasise all four wheels. Detail optimisation of the car’s aerodynamics enables a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.24.\n\nThe load compartment capacity of the new BMW iX3 can be increased from 520 to a maximum 1,750 litres by folding down the rear seat backrest elements as required. The additional storage compartment under the bonnet can hold another 58 litres of cargo. Customers needing additional transportation capacity can specify their car with the optional electric fold-in/fold-out trailer tow hitch. The maximum trailer load of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive is 2,000 kilograms.\n\nThe upright front end and clearly formed surfaces endows the new BMW iX3 with considerable presence. The BMW kidneys and twin headlights – both distinctive BMW design cues – take centre stage visually. The sculpted BMW kidneys reference the Neue Klasse of the 1960s in their vertical arrangement. An all-new light signature assumes the role previously performed by chrome in giving the car an aura of quality and sophistication. And when viewed from the side, large surfaces broken up by a small number of precise lines create a character-rich appearance. Flush glass surfaces and door handles are also features of the side view. The robust stature of the new BMW iX3 is underscored by body-colour wheel arches with – in familiar BMW X model style – subtly rectangular contours. The rear end also cuts a powerful and athletic figure. The taillights extending well into the centre of the rear end represent a horizontal interpretation of the signature BMW “L” shape.\n\nInterior design: modern space has a BMW-typical driver focus and offers exceptional comfort for all passengers.\n\nThe design of the BMW iX3 interior sets new standards in terms of modernity and digital experience. The interior has an uncluttered, reduced design, providing the ideal stage for the digital experience. The cabin is all about the clear driver focus for which BMW is renowned and comfort for all those on board. Created specifically for electric vehicles, the vehicle architecture allows for extremely generous levels of space in all five seats. The lines of the “floating” instrument panel flow directly into the large door trim panels, creating an enveloping wrap-around effect for the passengers. With its fabric surface, the instrument panel – with atmospheric backlighting – contributes to the warm and inviting atmosphere inside. Large window surfaces and the optional panoramic sunroof with climate comfort glazing generate an ambience bathed in light.\n\nAnother prominent influence in the horizontally arranged cockpit is the new control/operation system BMW Panoramic iDrive, which is based on the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X. It brings together displays, geometry and light & sound design into a holistic experience, customisable via the My Modes. Also playing a role here are the new driving sounds, sound effects and sound signals of the BMW HypersonX soundscape created specifically for the Neue Klasse.\n\nThe elegantly minimalist seats of the new design stand out with their excellent comfort levels over long journeys, sporty character, and wide range of adjustment. Also sporting an all-new design are the steering wheel and the centre console between the driver’s seat and front passenger seat, complete with storage areas and control elements. The rear seat bench offers a single, sofa-like seat surface.\n\nPrecisely arranged interior worlds bring a unique and thoroughly distinct character to every equipment package. The materials and colour schemes selected are inspired by modern interior design and advanced Neue Klasse technology, and coordinated harmoniously with one another. They therefore make a noticeable, visible contribution to the exceptional comfort levels on board the new BMW iX3. An attractive range of colours enables a perfect match between the interior tones and exterior paint finishes. As alternatives to the standard-specification Essential interior design in Vivid Grey with Econeer seat coverings, customers can also choose from three other compositions in Veganza, the black BMW M interior world in Veganza and M PerformTex, and the BMW Individual option with a high-quality Merino leather/M PerformTex combination in Black Bicolour or Adelaide Grey.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 can be specified as an option with the M Sport package or M Sport package Pro from launch. Its dynamic looks are further emphasised by Black high-gloss features for the exterior, and M Sport seats and an M steering wheel inside the car.\n\nThe BMW Iconic Glow exterior package enables an impressive sound and light sequence with Relaxed, Balanced and Excited styles. The welcome sequence commences as soon as the driver approaches the vehicle and, as they take their seat, an animated greeting begins in the BMW Panoramic Vision and Central Display, spreading smoothly from the driver’s side of the cockpit to the front passenger side.\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive: consummate driver focus, BMW-style.\n\nThe BMW iX3 is the first series-produced model in which BMW Panoramic iDrive redefines the user experience and therefore also Sheer Driving Pleasure. With its neatly judged balance between digital functions and physical elements, BMW Panoramic iDrive elevates intuitive operation – according to BMW’s fabled “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” principle – to a new level of driver focus. The entire system is born out of decades of experience and a user-centric design approach. Individual customer feedback, data from over 10 million connected vehicles and usability studies with more than 3,000 customers were all incorporated into the development process. Physical controls are on hand, including for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selector, parking brake, hazard warning lights, rear window heating and defrost function. Other functions have been optimised for use by touch and voice command or via the multifunction steering wheel.\n\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has been significantly upgraded and now includes two new voices, a new appearance for the BMW Panoramic Vision and additional assistance for the driver through proactive suggestions and personalisable routines. Large Language Model (LLM) technology will also be gradually introduced to enable even more intuitive voice interaction in the future.\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive brings four central elements together into a unique display and control/operation system. The BMW Panoramic Vision projects information across the full width of the windscreen, from A-pillar to A-pillar. The content in the centre and on the front passenger side can be adapted to personal tastes and requirements. Key driving information appears in the driver’s field of vision. And above the BMW Panoramic Vision, the BMW 3D Head-Up Display (if specified) can now also show integrated navigation and automated driving displays on the road with spatial depth. The free-cut-design Central Display with matrix backlight technology is located in an ergonomically ideal position next to the steering wheel. On the driver’s side, vertically arranged widgets enable fast and direct access to particularly frequently used functions using QuickSelect tech. The new multifunction steering wheel serves as the primary physical control point. Its button panels help the driver and vehicle to work together symbiotically using illuminations, a relief-like surface and haptic feedback.\n\nUnderpinning BMW Panoramic iDrive is the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X, which offers extensive scope for personalisation via the BMW ID, intelligent driver assistance, a wide variety of digital functions, extensive connectivity using the My BMW App and outstanding future-proofing thanks to BMW Software Updates.\n\nThe standard-fit navigation system BMW Maps features an upgrade for the charging-optimised route guidance, plus intelligently coordinated presentation of information on the BMW Panoramic Vision, Central Display and optional 3D Head-Up Display. The BMW Digital Key Plus can be set up on smartphones and smartwatches from all the leading makers, also as standard. Meanwhile, BMW Operating System X unlocks a wide variety of entertainment while on the road and during charging stops, bringing customers not only music streaming apps such as Spotify and in-car gaming with AirConsole, but also a video-streaming app offering Disney+, YouTube and other international/numerous country-specific on-demand and live video platforms. The Zoom App for video calls is now also available for use.\n\nThe BMW ConnectedDrive Store provides an overview of the features customers can currently download or access, and these can be added easily and flexibly through ConnectedDrive Upgrades. For example, more than 60 third-party apps in the music & audio, entertainment, gaming, news, and travel & local categories are available worldwide. To download the features and use the apps, customers will need access to connectivity via BMW Digital Premium or a WiFi network/smartphone hotspot. The BMW Digital Premium range of features customers can add as they desire comprises extensive safety functions, extended navigation features, unlimited data for entertainment and now also BMW M Apps.\n\nSixth-generation BMW eDrive technology: higher efficiency, more range, faster charging.\n\nThe sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the Neue Klasse comprises highly efficient electric motors, fundamentally new high-voltage batteries with cylindrical cells, and 800V technology. The BMW iX3 50 xDrive is powered by two electric motors, which together generate output of 345 kW/469 hp and 645 Nm (475 lb-ft) of torque. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (130 mph). Its electric all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) with particularly high levels of efficiency at the rear axle and, at the front axle, a new asynchronous motor (ASM) distinguished by its compact design and high cost efficiency. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of the BMW Group’s commitment to technological neutrality within electric mobility as well. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse reduces energy losses by 40 per cent compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10 per cent and manufacturing costs by 20 per cent.\n\nThe new high-voltage battery concept with cylindrical cells for the Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on a cell level is 20 per cent higher than with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and the new concept also paves the way for a 30 per cent increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a structural component to minimise weight (“pack to open body”). The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has a usable energy content of 108.7 kWh, enabling a range of up to 805 kilometres (500 miles) in the WLTP cycle.\n\nBMW Charging: short charging times, premiere for bidirectional charging.\n\nThe advances brought by sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology have a significant influence on the charging experience, too. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables users to fill their new BMW iX3 with enough energy at an 800V direct current (DC) rapid charging station to add up to 372 kilometres (231 miles)[1] of range in just ten minutes. The high-voltage battery can charge from 10 to 80 per cent capacity in 21 minutes. Thanks to the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed completely in-house by the BMW Group, the new BMW iX3 can also be charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation also help to shorten charging times. The new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can top up on alternating current (AC) at 11 kW as standard or 22 kW[2] as an option.\n\nExtensive bidirectional charging functions[3] are also available for the new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an energy supply source for a variety of applications. The Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power while on the move. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) hands it the role of storage unit for solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems. And customers can also hook their car up to the energy market via the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) application and earn some money in the process.\n\nThe selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a journey, customers can make use of the new Multifunction Charger, which comes with several adapters for charging and discharging the high-voltage battery. The new BMW Wallbox Professional (DC) enables bidirectional charging at home or work. And BMW Charging offers the option of cost-optimised /solar-power-optimised home charging. Emblematic of the charging experience in this new vehicle generation is the intelligent charging flap of the new BMW iX3, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the customer’s intention to top up their car and then automatically opens or closes. And sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology makes it possible to view the current charging speed and curve in the My BMW App. Up to ten individual charging contracts from various suppliers can be shown digitally inside the new BMW iX3, enabling use of the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function.\n\nHeart of Joy: Sheer Driving Pleasure reaches a new level.\n\nOne of four “superbrains” in the electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation and steering subfunctions, and processes information up to ten times faster than conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power transfer, agility, stability and efficiency is utilised to the full.\n\nTogether with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. Here, the decades of experience of BMW in the field of driving dynamics control come to the fore. The driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely harmonious and BMW-typical driving feeling whatever the situation and speed. Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal and steering is executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimised by the integrated management of drivetrain, braking system and energy recuperation. In everyday driving, 98 per cent of braking manoeuvres are carried out using recuperation only, i.e. without application of the friction brakes.\n\n“Superbrain of automated driving” for the driver assistance systems with new-generation technology.\n\nAnother high-performance computer brings together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW iX3. With 20 times greater processing power than conventional control units, the “superbrain of automated driving” enables a significant technological advance with the Neue Klasse in this area as well.\n\nBMW Symbiotic Drive provides seamless support. The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake or steer, their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled software.\n\nThe result is a whole new form of Sheer Driving Pleasure. These driver assistance functions are generally already included as standard with entry-level specification. For example, the automatic cruise control system is not deactivated with only a light press of the brake pedal; instead, it is only switched off when the driver brakes harder. In the same way, the lane control assistance remains active even after a small steering input by the driver.\n\nThe further-developed BMW motorway assistant supports BMW iX3 drivers from the moment they join a motorway until they leave it, and allows them to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods. The functionality offered by the City Assistant includes traffic light detection, where the car automatically stops and then moves off again.\n\nNew electronics architecture with four “superbrains”.\n\nThe completely newly developed electronics architecture comprises a total of four high-performance computers known as “superbrains”. They pool their processing power for driving dynamics, automated driving, infotainment and basic & comfort-enhancing functions. They also provide the basis for a new software architecture that can be continuously upgraded and is therefore designed to incorporate upcoming function updates including AI features.\n\nThe new digital nervous system consists of a wiring harness divided into four zones. This reduces weight by 30 per cent compared to the technology used previously and allows for around 600 metres less wiring. Another new feature are digital “smart eFuses”, which replace classical safety fuses. They enable intelligent power modes for different vehicle states that help to improve the car’s overall efficiency.\n\nWith its four superbrains and highly connected software platforms, the BMW iX3 is a true software-defined vehicle and exceptionally well equipped for the future. Added to which, the new electronics architecture forms the basis for multifaceted improvements in the networking of the BMW iX3 with the My BMW App. This new level of quality when it comes to integration delivers new experiences and holds considerable potential for future innovations.\n\nEquipment and individualisation to enhance driving pleasure, comfort and versatility.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 will be available with one solid and five metallic paint finishes from launch. As an alternative to the 20-inch light-alloy wheels fitted as standard, customers can also browse an exclusive selection of new light-alloy wheels (20-, 21- and 22-inch) available as an option. The range also includes BMW M and BMW Individual light-alloy wheels, some in aerodynamically and weight-optimised Air Performance specification.\n\nCustomers can tailor the design of the cabin to their personal style with the help of the Essential, Contemporary, M Sport and BMW Individual interior design worlds. The driver’s seat and front passenger seat are heated and electrically adjustable as standard. M Sport seats and multifunction seats are available as options. Also on the options list are a sports steering wheel and an M Sport steering wheel.\n\nStandard specification for the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive also includes two-zone automatic climate control, Comfort Access, automatic tailgate operation, the extended exterior mirror package, an alarm system and the telephony with wireless charging function. Among the other highlights of the optional equipment offering are three-zone automatic climate control, adaptive headlight functions with intelligent light control, the BMW Iconic Glow package including illuminated BMW kidneys, the Harman Kardon HiFi system with 13 speakers, steering wheel heating and a large panoramic sunroof, whose climate comfort glazing has unique solar energy filtering and 100-per cent UV protection.\n\nHolistic sustainability approach targeting circularity and CO2e reduction .\n\nThe BMW Group kicked off the development of its upcoming vehicle generation by intensifying its efforts to systematically implement “Design for Circularity” principles and further reduce CO2e emissions throughout the product life cycle. A holistic sustainability approach has therefore been applied for the new BMW iX3.\n\nA variety of measures ensures that the product carbon footprint of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive over its full life cycle – based on a mileage of 200,000 kilometres (124,260 miles) – is 34 per cent smaller than that of its predecessor.

For example, the storage compartment under the front hatch and the engine compartment cover are made from 30 per cent[4] recycled marine plastic. The base material of the yarn for the Econeer seat textile, the headliner (textile) and the floor-mat carpet is made from 100 per cent[5] recycled PET.

Detail optimisation of the car’s aerodynamics enables a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.24.\n\nThe load compartment capacity of the new BMW iX3 can be increased from 520 to a maximum 1,750 litres by folding down the rear seat backrest elements as required. The additional storage compartment under the bonnet can hold another 58 litres of cargo. Customers needing additional transportation capacity can specify their car with the optional electric fold-in/fold-out trailer tow hitch. The maximum trailer load of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive is 2,000 kilograms.\n\nThe upright front end and clearly formed surfaces endows the new BMW iX3 with considerable presence. The BMW kidneys and twin headlights – both distinctive BMW design cues – take centre stage visually. The sculpted BMW kidneys reference the Neue Klasse of the 1960s in their vertical arrangement. An all-new light signature assumes the role previously performed by chrome in giving the car an aura of quality and sophistication. And when viewed from the side, large surfaces broken up by a small number of precise lines create a character-rich appearance. Flush glass surfaces and door handles are also features of the side view. The robust stature of the new BMW iX3 is underscored by body-colour wheel arches with – in familiar BMW X model style – subtly rectangular contours. The rear end also cuts a powerful and athletic figure. The taillights extending well into the centre of the rear end represent a horizontal interpretation of the signature BMW “L” shape.\n\nInterior design: modern space has a BMW-typical driver focus and offers exceptional comfort for all passengers.\n\nThe design of the BMW iX3 interior sets new standards in terms of modernity and digital experience. The interior has an uncluttered, reduced design, providing the ideal stage for the digital experience. The cabin is all about the clear driver focus for which BMW is renowned and comfort for all those on board. Created specifically for electric vehicles, the vehicle architecture allows for extremely generous levels of space in all five seats. The lines of the “floating” instrument panel flow directly into the large door trim panels, creating an enveloping wrap-around effect for the passengers. With its fabric surface, the instrument panel – with atmospheric backlighting – contributes to the warm and inviting atmosphere inside. Large window surfaces and the optional panoramic sunroof with climate comfort glazing generate an ambience bathed in light.\n\nAnother prominent influence in the horizontally arranged cockpit is the new control/operation system BMW Panoramic iDrive, which is based on the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X. It brings together displays, geometry and light & sound design into a holistic experience, customisable via the My Modes. Also playing a role here are the new driving sounds, sound effects and sound signals of the BMW HypersonX soundscape created specifically for the Neue Klasse.\n\nThe elegantly minimalist seats of the new design stand out with their excellent comfort levels over long journeys, sporty character, and wide range of adjustment. Also sporting an all-new design are the steering wheel and the centre console between the driver’s seat and front passenger seat, complete with storage areas and control elements. The rear seat bench offers a single, sofa-like seat surface.\n\nPrecisely arranged interior worlds bring a unique and thoroughly distinct character to every equipment package. The materials and colour schemes selected are inspired by modern interior design and advanced Neue Klasse technology, and coordinated harmoniously with one another. They therefore make a noticeable, visible contribution to the exceptional comfort levels on board the new BMW iX3. An attractive range of colours enables a perfect match between the interior tones and exterior paint finishes. As alternatives to the standard-specification Essential interior design in Vivid Grey with Econeer seat coverings, customers can also choose from three other compositions in Veganza, the black BMW M interior world in Veganza and M PerformTex, and the BMW Individual option with a high-quality Merino leather/M PerformTex combination in Black Bicolour or Adelaide Grey.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 can be specified as an option with the M Sport package or M Sport package Pro from launch. Its dynamic looks are further emphasised by Black high-gloss features for the exterior, and M Sport seats and an M steering wheel inside the car.\n\nThe BMW Iconic Glow exterior package enables an impressive sound and light sequence with Relaxed, Balanced and Excited styles. The welcome sequence commences as soon as the driver approaches the vehicle and, as they take their seat, an animated greeting begins in the BMW Panoramic Vision and Central Display, spreading smoothly from the driver’s side of the cockpit to the front passenger side.\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive: consummate driver focus, BMW-style.\n\nThe BMW iX3 is the first series-produced model in which BMW Panoramic iDrive redefines the user experience and therefore also Sheer Driving Pleasure. With its neatly judged balance between digital functions and physical elements, BMW Panoramic iDrive elevates intuitive operation – according to BMW’s fabled “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” principle – to a new level of driver focus. The entire system is born out of decades of experience and a user-centric design approach. Individual customer feedback, data from over 10 million connected vehicles and usability studies with more than 3,000 customers were all incorporated into the development process. Physical controls are on hand, including for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selector, parking brake, hazard warning lights, rear window heating and defrost function. Other functions have been optimised for use by touch and voice command or via the multifunction steering wheel.\n\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has been significantly upgraded and now includes two new voices, a new appearance for the BMW Panoramic Vision and additional assistance for the driver through proactive suggestions and personalisable routines. Large Language Model (LLM) technology will also be gradually introduced to enable even more intuitive voice interaction in the future.\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive brings four central elements together into a unique display and control/operation system. The BMW Panoramic Vision projects information across the full width of the windscreen, from A-pillar to A-pillar. The content in the centre and on the front passenger side can be adapted to personal tastes and requirements. Key driving information appears in the driver’s field of vision. And above the BMW Panoramic Vision, the BMW 3D Head-Up Display (if specified) can now also show integrated navigation and automated driving displays on the road with spatial depth. The free-cut-design Central Display with matrix backlight technology is located in an ergonomically ideal position next to the steering wheel. On the driver’s side, vertically arranged widgets enable fast and direct access to particularly frequently used functions using QuickSelect tech. The new multifunction steering wheel serves as the primary physical control point. Its button panels help the driver and vehicle to work together symbiotically using illuminations, a relief-like surface and haptic feedback.\n\nUnderpinning BMW Panoramic iDrive is the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X, which offers extensive scope for personalisation via the BMW ID, intelligent driver assistance, a wide variety of digital functions, extensive connectivity using the My BMW App and outstanding future-proofing thanks to BMW Software Updates.\n\nThe standard-fit navigation system BMW Maps features an upgrade for the charging-optimised route guidance, plus intelligently coordinated presentation of information on the BMW Panoramic Vision, Central Display and optional 3D Head-Up Display. The BMW Digital Key Plus can be set up on smartphones and smartwatches from all the leading makers, also as standard. Meanwhile, BMW Operating System X unlocks a wide variety of entertainment while on the road and during charging stops, bringing customers not only music streaming apps such as Spotify and in-car gaming with AirConsole, but also a video-streaming app offering Disney+, YouTube and other international/numerous country-specific on-demand and live video platforms. The Zoom App for video calls is now also available for use.\n\nThe BMW ConnectedDrive Store provides an overview of the features customers can currently download or access, and these can be added easily and flexibly through ConnectedDrive Upgrades. For example, more than 60 third-party apps in the music & audio, entertainment, gaming, news, and travel & local categories are available worldwide. To download the features and use the apps, customers will need access to connectivity via BMW Digital Premium or a WiFi network/smartphone hotspot. The BMW Digital Premium range of features customers can add as they desire comprises extensive safety functions, extended navigation features, unlimited data for entertainment and now also BMW M Apps.\n\nSixth-generation BMW eDrive technology: higher efficiency, more range, faster charging.\n\nThe sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the Neue Klasse comprises highly efficient electric motors, fundamentally new high-voltage batteries with cylindrical cells, and 800V technology. The BMW iX3 50 xDrive is powered by two electric motors, which together generate output of 345 kW/469 hp and 645 Nm (475 lb-ft) of torque. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (130 mph). Its electric all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) with particularly high levels of efficiency at the rear axle and, at the front axle, a new asynchronous motor (ASM) distinguished by its compact design and high cost efficiency. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of the BMW Group’s commitment to technological neutrality within electric mobility as well. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse reduces energy losses by 40 per cent compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10 per cent and manufacturing costs by 20 per cent.\n\nThe new high-voltage battery concept with cylindrical cells for the Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on a cell level is 20 per cent higher than with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and the new concept also paves the way for a 30 per cent increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a structural component to minimise weight (“pack to open body”). The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has a usable energy content of 108.7 kWh, enabling a range of up to 805 kilometres (500 miles) in the WLTP cycle.\n\nBMW Charging: short charging times, premiere for bidirectional charging.\n\nThe advances brought by sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology have a significant influence on the charging experience, too. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables users to fill their new BMW iX3 with enough energy at an 800V direct current (DC) rapid charging station to add up to 372 kilometres (231 miles)[1] of range in just ten minutes. The high-voltage battery can charge from 10 to 80 per cent capacity in 21 minutes. Thanks to the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed completely in-house by the BMW Group, the new BMW iX3 can also be charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation also help to shorten charging times. The new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can top up on alternating current (AC) at 11 kW as standard or 22 kW[2] as an option.\n\nExtensive bidirectional charging functions[3] are also available for the new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an energy supply source for a variety of applications. The Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power while on the move. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) hands it the role of storage unit for solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems. And customers can also hook their car up to the energy market via the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) application and earn some money in the process.\n\nThe selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a journey, customers can make use of the new Multifunction Charger, which comes with several adapters for charging and discharging the high-voltage battery. The new BMW Wallbox Professional (DC) enables bidirectional charging at home or work. And BMW Charging offers the option of cost-optimised /solar-power-optimised home charging. Emblematic of the charging experience in this new vehicle generation is the intelligent charging flap of the new BMW iX3, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the customer’s intention to top up their car and then automatically opens or closes. And sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology makes it possible to view the current charging speed and curve in the My BMW App. Up to ten individual charging contracts from various suppliers can be shown digitally inside the new BMW iX3, enabling use of the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function.\n\nHeart of Joy: Sheer Driving Pleasure reaches a new level.\n\nOne of four “superbrains” in the electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation and steering subfunctions, and processes information up to ten times faster than conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power transfer, agility, stability and efficiency is utilised to the full.\n\nTogether with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. Here, the decades of experience of BMW in the field of driving dynamics control come to the fore. The driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely harmonious and BMW-typical driving feeling whatever the situation and speed. Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal and steering is executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimised by the integrated management of drivetrain, braking system and energy recuperation. In everyday driving, 98 per cent of braking manoeuvres are carried out using recuperation only, i.e. without application of the friction brakes.\n\n“Superbrain of automated driving” for the driver assistance systems with new-generation technology.\n\nAnother high-performance computer brings together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW iX3. With 20 times greater processing power than conventional control units, the “superbrain of automated driving” enables a significant technological advance with the Neue Klasse in this area as well.\n\nBMW Symbiotic Drive provides seamless support. The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake or steer, their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled software.\n\nThe result is a whole new form of Sheer Driving Pleasure. These driver assistance functions are generally already included as standard with entry-level specification. For example, the automatic cruise control system is not deactivated with only a light press of the brake pedal; instead, it is only switched off when the driver brakes harder. In the same way, the lane control assistance remains active even after a small steering input by the driver.\n\nThe further-developed BMW motorway assistant supports BMW iX3 drivers from the moment they join a motorway until they leave it, and allows them to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods. The functionality offered by the City Assistant includes traffic light detection, where the car automatically stops and then moves off again.\n\nNew electronics architecture with four “superbrains”.\n\nThe completely newly developed electronics architecture comprises a total of four high-performance computers known as “superbrains”. They pool their processing power for driving dynamics, automated driving, infotainment and basic & comfort-enhancing functions. They also provide the basis for a new software architecture that can be continuously upgraded and is therefore designed to incorporate upcoming function updates including AI features.\n\nThe new digital nervous system consists of a wiring harness divided into four zones. This reduces weight by 30 per cent compared to the technology used previously and allows for around 600 metres less wiring. Another new feature are digital “smart eFuses”, which replace classical safety fuses. They enable intelligent power modes for different vehicle states that help to improve the car’s overall efficiency.\n\nWith its four superbrains and highly connected software platforms, the BMW iX3 is a true software-defined vehicle and exceptionally well equipped for the future. Added to which, the new electronics architecture forms the basis for multifaceted improvements in the networking of the BMW iX3 with the My BMW App. This new level of quality when it comes to integration delivers new experiences and holds considerable potential for future innovations.\n\nEquipment and individualisation to enhance driving pleasure, comfort and versatility.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 will be available with one solid and five metallic paint finishes from launch. As an alternative to the 20-inch light-alloy wheels fitted as standard, customers can also browse an exclusive selection of new light-alloy wheels (20-, 21- and 22-inch) available as an option. The range also includes BMW M and BMW Individual light-alloy wheels, some in aerodynamically and weight-optimised Air Performance specification.\n\nCustomers can tailor the design of the cabin to their personal style with the help of the Essential, Contemporary, M Sport and BMW Individual interior design worlds. The driver’s seat and front passenger seat are heated and electrically adjustable as standard. M Sport seats and multifunction seats are available as options. Also on the options list are a sports steering wheel and an M Sport steering wheel.\n\nStandard specification for the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive also includes two-zone automatic climate control, Comfort Access, automatic tailgate operation, the extended exterior mirror package, an alarm system and the telephony with wireless charging function. Among the other highlights of the optional equipment offering are three-zone automatic climate control, adaptive headlight functions with intelligent light control, the BMW Iconic Glow package including illuminated BMW kidneys, the Harman Kardon HiFi system with 13 speakers, steering wheel heating and a large panoramic sunroof, whose climate comfort glazing has unique solar energy filtering and 100-per cent UV protection.\n\nHolistic sustainability approach targeting circularity and CO2e reduction .\n\nThe BMW Group kicked off the development of its upcoming vehicle generation by intensifying its efforts to systematically implement “Design for Circularity” principles and further reduce CO2e emissions throughout the product life cycle. A holistic sustainability approach has therefore been applied for the new BMW iX3.\n\nA variety of measures ensures that the product carbon footprint of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive over its full life cycle – based on a mileage of 200,000 kilometres (124,260 miles) – is 34 per cent smaller than that of its predecessor. This means that, when charged with electricity from the European energy mix, it has a smaller product carbon footprint than a comparable combustion-engined (ICE) model after around 21,500 kilometres (13,358 miles). When charged exclusively with electricity from renewable sources, the BMW iX3 50 xDrive beats the comparable ICE model after only 17,500 kilometres (10,873 miles, WLTP combined), allowing customers to potentially achieve CO₂e advantages over the ICE model in as little as one year.\n\nAround one third of the new BMW iX3 is made from secondary raw materials. For example, the storage compartment under the front hatch and the engine compartment cover are made from 30 per cent[4] recycled marine plastic. The base material of the yarn for the Econeer seat textile, the headliner (textile) and the floor-mat carpet is made from 100 per cent[5] recycled PET. When it comes to the car’s chassis, aluminium consisting of 80 per cent secondary raw material is used for the swivel bearings and hub carriers, while the wheel rims are cast from aluminium with a 70 per cent secondary raw material content.\n\nThe overall product carbon footprint of the supply chain for the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has been reduced by 35 per cent. Production and operations at BMW Group Plant Debrecen do not use fossil fuels in normal operating conditions. And thanks to sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology and other BMW EfficientDynamics measures, the energy consumption of the new BMW iX3 is 20 per cent lower than that of the predecessor model (WLTP combined).\n\n[1] The added range after ten minutes of high-power charging was determined in accordance with ISO12906 in the WLTP cycle. This and the charging performance depend on the vehicle specification, battery charge, condition and temperature, individual driving profile, use of auxiliary consumers, ambient temperature and the charging power provided by the charging point.\n\n[2] Available from production period 3/2026.\n\n[3] Available from production period 3/2026.\n\n[4] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\n[5] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\n[6] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NA5, iX3, BMW i"}]}

The new-generation BMW iX3 is a fully electric Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) that gives customers their first on-the-road taste of a whole new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure. An all-new design language gives the car a character-rich appearance that faithfully conveys the technological progress made by the new model. With sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology, a range of up to 805 kilometres (500 ...A defining element of the digital user experience in the new #BMW iX3 is BMW Panoramic iDrive, which elevates intuitive operation and the driver focus for which the brand is renowned to a new level. And an all-encompassing sustainability concept reduces the car’s product carbon footprint over its life cycle by more than 30 per cent compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe first Neue Klasse model will be built at the newly constructed BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The first variant of the fully electric SAV to roll off the production line from autumn 2025 will be the BMW iX3 50 xDrive (electric power consumption, combined: 17.9 – 15.1 kWh/100 km; CO2 class: A; range: 679 – 805 km [421 – 500 miles]; provisional figures as per WLTP) with an output of 345 kW/469 hp and electric all-wheel drive. Further fully electric variants will follow, including an entry-level model. The market launch of the new BMW iX3 will get underway in Europe in spring 2026 and in the USA in summer 2026. Also starting in summer 2026 will be deliveries of a variant of the new BMW iX3 produced at the Shenyang facility that has been tailored specifically to the needs and desires of customers in China.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 represents a leap forward in development over its predecessor of the same name that extends well beyond the reaches of a conventional model renewal. The advances made in terms of design and technology create the impression that a complete vehicle generation has been skipped. For the BMW Group, the launch of the new BMW iX3 also represents a milestone in the transformation process when it comes to electrification, digitalisation and circularity. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, it offers customers the latest design and technology innovations, which will shape the brand’s entire model range moving forwards. The technologies of the Neue Klasse will be incorporated into a total of 40 new models and model updates between now and 2027.\n\n“The Neue Klasse is our biggest future project and marks a huge leap in terms of technologies, driving experience and design,” says Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “Practically everything about it is new, yet it is also more BMW than ever. Our entire product range will benefit from the innovations of the Neue Klasse – regardless of the drive technology. What started as a bold vision has now become reality: the BMW iX3 is the first Neue Klasse model to go into series production. We are not only bringing the next generation of one of our most successful fully electric vehicles onto the road, we are launching a new era for BMW.”\n\nLaunch of the new design language: reduced, characterful and timeless.\n\nMajor technological advances always offer an opportunity to introduce more significant design changes. The new BMW iX3 will launch the new BMW design language, which will be replicated across the whole of the brand’s model range in due course. This new use of forms provides a very modern interpretation of BMW’s original and enduring blueprint. The design is timeless while also capturing the prevailing zeitgeist. It is reduced to the essence of the BMW brand – and therefore more BMW than ever. For this one reason why comprehensive design protection has been registered for the new BMW design language used in the new BMW iX3.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 showcases the values and qualities of the Neue Klasse within the template of an SAV. The first BMW X model of the new generation is all about interior space and a progressive lifestyle. At 4,782 millimetres in length, 1,895 millimetres wide and 1,635 millimetres tall, the new BMW iX3 has the hallmark proportions of an SAV.

Its electric all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) with particularly high levels of efficiency at the rear axle and, at the front axle, a new asynchronous motor (ASM) distinguished by its compact design and high cost efficiency. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of the BMW Group’s commitment to technological neutrality within electric mobility as well. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse reduces energy losses by 40 per cent compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10 per cent and manufacturing costs by 20 per cent.\n\nThe new high-voltage battery concept with cylindrical cells for the Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on a cell level is 20 per cent higher than with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and the new concept also paves the way for a 30 per cent increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a structural component to minimise weight (“pack to open body”). The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has a usable energy content of 108.7 kWh, enabling a range of up to 805 kilometres (500 miles) in the WLTP cycle.\n\nBMW Charging: short charging times, premiere for bidirectional charging.\n\nThe advances brought by sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology have a significant influence on the charging experience, too. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables users to fill their new BMW iX3 with enough energy at an 800V direct current (DC) rapid charging station to add up to 372 kilometres (231 miles)[1] of range in just ten minutes. The high-voltage battery can charge from 10 to 80 per cent capacity in 21 minutes. Thanks to the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed completely in-house by the BMW Group, the new BMW iX3 can also be charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation also help to shorten charging times. The new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can top up on alternating current (AC) at 11 kW as standard or 22 kW[2] as an option.\n\nExtensive bidirectional charging functions[3] are also available for the new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an energy supply source for a variety of applications. The Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power while on the move. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) hands it the role of storage unit for solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems. And customers can also hook their car up to the energy market via the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) application and earn some money in the process.\n\nThe selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a journey, customers can make use of the new Multifunction Charger, which comes with several adapters for charging and discharging the high-voltage battery. The new BMW Wallbox Professional (DC) enables bidirectional charging at home or work. And BMW Charging offers the option of cost-optimised /solar-power-optimised home charging. Emblematic of the charging experience in this new vehicle generation is the intelligent charging flap of the new BMW iX3, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the customer’s intention to top up their car and then automatically opens or closes. And sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology makes it possible to view the current charging speed and curve in the My BMW App. Up to ten individual charging contracts from various suppliers can be shown digitally inside the new BMW iX3, enabling use of the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function.\n\nHeart of Joy: Sheer Driving Pleasure reaches a new level.\n\nOne of four “superbrains” in the electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation and steering subfunctions, and processes information up to ten times faster than conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power transfer, agility, stability and efficiency is utilised to the full.\n\nTogether with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. Here, the decades of experience of BMW in the field of driving dynamics control come to the fore. The driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely harmonious and BMW-typical driving feeling whatever the situation and speed. Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal and steering is executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimised by the integrated management of drivetrain, braking system and energy recuperation. In everyday driving, 98 per cent of braking manoeuvres are carried out using recuperation only, i.e. without application of the friction brakes.\n\n“Superbrain of automated driving” for the driver assistance systems with new-generation technology.\n\nAnother high-performance computer brings together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW iX3. With 20 times greater processing power than conventional control units, the “superbrain of automated driving” enables a significant technological advance with the Neue Klasse in this area as well.\n\nBMW Symbiotic Drive provides seamless support. The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake or steer, their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled software.\n\nThe result is a whole new form of Sheer Driving Pleasure. These driver assistance functions are generally already included as standard with entry-level specification. For example, the automatic cruise control system is not deactivated with only a light press of the brake pedal; instead, it is only switched off when the driver brakes harder. In the same way, the lane control assistance remains active even after a small steering input by the driver.\n\nThe further-developed BMW motorway assistant supports BMW iX3 drivers from the moment they join a motorway until they leave it, and allows them to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods. The functionality offered by the City Assistant includes traffic light detection, where the car automatically stops and then moves off again.\n\nNew electronics architecture with four “superbrains”.\n\nThe completely newly developed electronics architecture comprises a total of four high-performance computers known as “superbrains”. They pool their processing power for driving dynamics, automated driving, infotainment and basic & comfort-enhancing functions. They also provide the basis for a new software architecture that can be continuously upgraded and is therefore designed to incorporate upcoming function updates including AI features.\n\nThe new digital nervous system consists of a wiring harness divided into four zones. This reduces weight by 30 per cent compared to the technology used previously and allows for around 600 metres less wiring. Another new feature are digital “smart eFuses”, which replace classical safety fuses. They enable intelligent power modes for different vehicle states that help to improve the car’s overall efficiency.\n\nWith its four superbrains and highly connected software platforms, the BMW iX3 is a true software-defined vehicle and exceptionally well equipped for the future. Added to which, the new electronics architecture forms the basis for multifaceted improvements in the networking of the BMW iX3 with the My BMW App. This new level of quality when it comes to integration delivers new experiences and holds considerable potential for future innovations.\n\nEquipment and individualisation to enhance driving pleasure, comfort and versatility.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 will be available with one solid and five metallic paint finishes from launch. As an alternative to the 20-inch light-alloy wheels fitted as standard, customers can also browse an exclusive selection of new light-alloy wheels (20-, 21- and 22-inch) available as an option. The range also includes BMW M and BMW Individual light-alloy wheels, some in aerodynamically and weight-optimised Air Performance specification.\n\nCustomers can tailor the design of the cabin to their personal style with the help of the Essential, Contemporary, M Sport and BMW Individual interior design worlds. The driver’s seat and front passenger seat are heated and electrically adjustable as standard. M Sport seats and multifunction seats are available as options. Also on the options list are a sports steering wheel and an M Sport steering wheel.\n\nStandard specification for the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive also includes two-zone automatic climate control, Comfort Access, automatic tailgate operation, the extended exterior mirror package, an alarm system and the telephony with wireless charging function. Among the other highlights of the optional equipment offering are three-zone automatic climate control, adaptive headlight functions with intelligent light control, the BMW Iconic Glow package including illuminated BMW kidneys, the Harman Kardon HiFi system with 13 speakers, steering wheel heating and a large panoramic sunroof, whose climate comfort glazing has unique solar energy filtering and 100-per cent UV protection.\n\nHolistic sustainability approach targeting circularity and CO2e reduction .\n\nThe BMW Group kicked off the development of its upcoming vehicle generation by intensifying its efforts to systematically implement “Design for Circularity” principles and further reduce CO2e emissions throughout the product life cycle. A holistic sustainability approach has therefore been applied for the new BMW iX3.\n\nA variety of measures ensures that the product carbon footprint of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive over its full life cycle – based on a mileage of 200,000 kilometres (124,260 miles) – is 34 per cent smaller than that of its predecessor. This means that, when charged with electricity from the European energy mix, it has a smaller product carbon footprint than a comparable combustion-engined (ICE) model after around 21,500 kilometres (13,358 miles). When charged exclusively with electricity from renewable sources, the BMW iX3 50 xDrive beats the comparable ICE model after only 17,500 kilometres (10,873 miles, WLTP combined), allowing customers to potentially achieve CO₂e advantages over the ICE model in as little as one year.\n\nAround one third of the new BMW iX3 is made from secondary raw materials. For example, the storage compartment under the front hatch and the engine compartment cover are made from 30 per cent[4] recycled marine plastic. The base material of the yarn for the Econeer seat textile, the headliner (textile) and the floor-mat carpet is made from 100 per cent[5] recycled PET. When it comes to the car’s chassis, aluminium consisting of 80 per cent secondary raw material is used for the swivel bearings and hub carriers, while the wheel rims are cast from aluminium with a 70 per cent secondary raw material content.\n\nThe overall product carbon footprint of the supply chain for the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has been reduced by 35 per cent. Production and operations at BMW Group Plant Debrecen do not use fossil fuels in normal operating conditions. And thanks to sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology and other BMW EfficientDynamics measures, the energy consumption of the new BMW iX3 is 20 per cent lower than that of the predecessor model (WLTP combined).\n\n[1] The added range after ten minutes of high-power charging was determined in accordance with ISO12906 in the WLTP cycle. This and the charging performance depend on the vehicle specification, battery charge, condition and temperature, individual driving profile, use of auxiliary consumers, ambient temperature and the charging power provided by the charging point.\n\n[2] Available from production period 3/2026.\n\n[3] Available from production period 3/2026.\n\n[4] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\n[5] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\n[6] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Kit"}]}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport experienced a weekend of mixed emotions at the opening round of the European leg of this season’s FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Assen, the Netherlands. Scott Redding (GBR) from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team claimed his best results of the season so far in the Superpole and the races. Meanwhile, his team-mate and local favourite Michael van der Mark (NED) suffered a big crash in race two. He suffered a leg injury and has been taken to an Assen hospital for further examinations after being checked in the Medical Centre. In the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, Garrett Gerloff (USA) ended both main races in twelfth place. Loris Baz (FRA) showed his fighting spirit on his return to the saddle just a few weeks after injuring his leg.\n\nScott Redding produced an impressive lap on his BMW M 1000 RR in Saturday morning’s Superpole qualifying to secure fifth place on the grid. Baz qualified 13th, while van der Mark and Gerloff ended qualifying in 15th and 17th place. Redding made a good start in race one on Saturday afternoon and was running in the top five until lap 17 of 21. At one point he had climbed into fourth place. However, his front tyre then started to wear dramatically, and Redding eventually crossed the finish line in 10th place. Gerloff lost a position on lap one, but then consistently worked his way through the field to finish 12th. He was followed over the line by van der Mark in 13th. The Dutchman was lacking the confidence in the front of his bike to be able to attack. Baz overcame the pain in his injured leg to finish 17th after 21 laps of racing.\n\nA technical issue encountered during the warm-up lap meant Baz was unable to line up in the Superpole Race. The start was delayed, and the sprint reduced to eight laps. Redding came home eighth. Van der Mark gained five positions to finish 10th, while Gerloff crossed the finish line 17th.\n\nIn race two on Sunday afternoon, Redding immediately climbed from eighth to seventh at the start. As the race progressed, he spent eight laps in sixth place before dropping a position in the closing stages. Seventh place represents Redding’s best race result of the season so far. Gerloff dropped back to 20th place at the start, but then fought back to match the 12th place he claimed on Saturday. Van der Mark attempted to make progress from 15th on the grid but suffered a big crash on lap two and injured his leg. Baz was on course for a fine points finish until lap nine, when he too crashed out. The Frenchman was unhurt.\n\nRound four of the 2023 WorldSBK takes place in Barcelona (ESP) in two weeks, from 5th to 7th May.\n\nQuotes after the Assen races.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Michael’s crash was a sad end to a weekend, at which we witnessed a few rays of hope. We made a relatively good start to the weekend and, after the test in Barcelona, lined up with some improvements. The first free practice sessions went as expected and were satisfactory. Scott secured a fine fifth place in qualifying, and a good grid position is important in this extremely well-matched field. The others had difficulties. Scott produced a very strong performance in race one and was in P4 for a long time. We took a bit of a risk with the front tyre, which unfortunately did not pay off. We learned from that for the Superpole Race and race two. The performance was good again in race two. The fact is that we are not yet among the front-runners, but Scott was still able to hold on for seventh place. He also gave us some good input, as to how we need to progress. However, it was a great shame that Michael had that big crash so early in the race. We must await the diagnosis, but definitely wish him all the best. The main thing is that he recovers quickly. Respect to Loris. It was good to see him back on the bike and, despite being in pain, he performed well. Garrett struggled all weekend to find his rhythm on the opening laps of the race. That is reflected in his results. In the final race, he set very similar lap times to Scott after lap five – sometimes even faster. However, if you are not on it from the start, then you cannot make progress later. We will soon do some testing in Misano, where we will make more changes to the bike, in order to take the next step.”\n\nScott Redding, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 5 / R01: 10 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 7): “I was quite happy that I could be up in the race and even more as I was able to push the bike a little bit, which was nice. But still, we are struggling in some areas and it’s difficult because you cannot get much time back on the others. But I feel like I was riding well. I enjoyed riding the bike this week which was nice for me, and I was fighting in positions where I felt we should be. Yesterday I struggled with the front tyre and today I struggled with rear grip over the entire race. But it was a better weekend, we got some good information. And now we will see if we can bring something to further improve.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 17 / R01: 12 / SP Race: 17 / R02: 12): “I feel like we had some good pace, just starting from so far back after having such a tricky qualifying was making it difficult. It was my own fault really for being so far back and that’s the most frustrating thing. Also, it was so close, as it was so tight between everybody. It would have been nice to start a few rows forward and I could have changed some things. In the Superpole Race I just didn’t have anything to make up any ground, with only eight laps it was super difficult. In race two I had a good start, but in the first corner, I got bottlenecked and had to brake and check where the guys were around me. I just had to fight to come back. It was a long day. I’m looking forward to the next round, I like Barcelona. I’ll go back there and try to have some good results.”\n\nLoris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 13 / R01: 17 / SP Race: DNS / R02: DNF): “I’m ok, but my first thought was for Michael (van der Mark), because I was right behind him when he crashed, and it was really a big one. I know what he has been through and it’s really tough seeing him in this kind of situation again. I wish him a quick recovery and hope he can come back soon. I had a good start, and I was feeling better with the leg compared to yesterday. In the Superpole Race we had a technical issue, so I didn’t do a lap. We had to change the engine between the Superpole and the main race and the new engine didn’t feel the same, so I lost some time during the first laps. Then Öttl overtook me, as he was a bit faster in the parts where I was struggling. But I was catching him in some other fast places. Coming into that last fast left, it was three or four laps in a row that I gone wide there, and I was worried about crashing, so on that lap, I really rolled early to stay on the line and I crashed there. For sure, I released the brake earlier, maybe I went too inside, it’s just strange. I feel sorry for the team because the bike is destroyed. I was feeling better, but when you don’t feel at 100% all weekend, you obviously force it a bit in some places because I couldn’t move. I was trying to get some points; I was pretty fast considering the shape I’m in. It was a rough weekend, really hard, but we keep moving forward. Scott (Redding) has shown that the bike has something more than we did this weekend. For sure, I will feel better in Barcelona. I hope I’ll be able to come back to my normal pace.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW Motorrad Motorsport experienced a weekend of mixed emotions at the opening round of the European leg of this season’s FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Assen, the Netherlands.

Scott produced a very strong performance in race one and was in P4 for a long time. We took a bit of a risk with the front tyre, which unfortunately did not pay off. We learned from that for the Superpole Race and race two. The performance was good again in race two. The fact is that we are not yet among the front-runners, but Scott was still able to hold on for seventh place. He also gave us some good input, as to how we need to progress. However, it was a great shame that Michael had that big crash so early in the race. We must await the diagnosis, but definitely wish him all the best. The main thing is that he recovers quickly. Respect to Loris. It was good to see him back on the bike and, despite being in pain, he performed well. Garrett struggled all weekend to find his rhythm on the opening laps of the race. That is reflected in his results. In the final race, he set very similar lap times to Scott after lap five – sometimes even faster. However, if you are not on it from the start, then you cannot make progress later. We will soon do some testing in Misano, where we will make more changes to the bike, in order to take the next step.”\n\nScott Redding, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 5 / R01: 10 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 7): “I was quite happy that I could be up in the race and even more as I was able to push the bike a little bit, which was nice. But still, we are struggling in some areas and it’s difficult because you cannot get much time back on the others. But I feel like I was riding well. I enjoyed riding the bike this week which was nice for me, and I was fighting in positions where I felt we should be. Yesterday I struggled with the front tyre and today I struggled with rear grip over the entire race. But it was a better weekend, we got some good information. And now we will see if we can bring something to further improve.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 17 / R01: 12 / SP Race: 17 / R02: 12): “I feel like we had some good pace, just starting from so far back after having such a tricky qualifying was making it difficult. It was my own fault really for being so far back and that’s the most frustrating thing. Also, it was so close, as it was so tight between everybody. It would have been nice to start a few rows forward and I could have changed some things. In the Superpole Race I just didn’t have anything to make up any ground, with only eight laps it was super difficult. In race two I had a good start, but in the first corner, I got bottlenecked and had to brake and check where the guys were around me. I just had to fight to come back. It was a long day. I’m looking forward to the next round, I like Barcelona. I’ll go back there and try to have some good results.”\n\nLoris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 13 / R01: 17 / SP Race: DNS / R02: DNF): “I’m ok, but my first thought was for Michael (van der Mark), because I was right behind him when he crashed, and it was really a big one. I know what he has been through and it’s really tough seeing him in this kind of situation again. I wish him a quick recovery and hope he can come back soon. I had a good start, and I was feeling better with the leg compared to yesterday. In the Superpole Race we had a technical issue, so I didn’t do a lap. We had to change the engine between the Superpole and the main race and the new engine didn’t feel the same, so I lost some time during the first laps. Then Öttl overtook me, as he was a bit faster in the parts where I was struggling. But I was catching him in some other fast places. Coming into that last fast left, it was three or four laps in a row that I gone wide there, and I was worried about crashing, so on that lap, I really rolled early to stay on the line and I crashed there. For sure, I released the brake earlier, maybe I went too inside, it’s just strange. I feel sorry for the team because the bike is destroyed. I was feeling better, but when you don’t feel at 100% all weekend, you obviously force it a bit in some places because I couldn’t move. I was trying to get some points; I was pretty fast considering the shape I’m in. It was a rough weekend, really hard, but we keep moving forward. Scott (Redding) has shown that the bike has something more than we did this weekend. For sure, I will feel better in Barcelona. I hope I’ll be able to come back to my normal pace.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Motorcycle Sports, Superbike Championship"}]}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport experienced a weekend of mixed emotions at the opening round of the European leg of this season’s FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Assen, the Netherlands. Scott Redding (GBR) from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team claimed his best results of the season so far in the Superpole and the races. Meanwhile, his team-mate and local favourite Michael van der Mark (NED) suffered a big crash in race two. He suffered a leg injury and has been taken to an Assen hospital for further examinations after being checked in the Medical Centre. In the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, Garrett Gerloff (USA) ended both main races in twelfth place. Loris Baz (FRA) showed his fighting spirit on his return to the saddle just a few weeks after injuring his leg.\n\nScott Redding produced an impressive lap on his BMW M 1000 RR in Saturday morning’s Superpole qualifying to secure fifth place on the grid. Baz qualified 13th, while van der Mark and Gerloff ended qualifying in 15th and 17th place. Redding made a good start in race one on Saturday afternoon and was running in the top five until lap 17 of 21. At one point he had climbed into fourth place. However, his front tyre then started to wear dramatically, and Redding eventually crossed the finish line in 10th place. Gerloff lost a position on lap one, but then consistently worked his way through the field to finish 12th. He was followed over the line by van der Mark in 13th. The Dutchman was lacking the confidence in the front of his bike to be able to attack. Baz overcame the pain in his injured leg to finish 17th after 21 laps of racing.\n\nA technical issue encountered during the warm-up lap meant Baz was unable to line up in the Superpole Race. The start was delayed, and the sprint reduced to eight laps. Redding came home eighth. Van der Mark gained five positions to finish 10th, while Gerloff crossed the finish line 17th.\n\nIn race two on Sunday afternoon, Redding immediately climbed from eighth to seventh at the start. As the race progressed, he spent eight laps in sixth place before dropping a position in the closing stages. Seventh place represents Redding’s best race result of the season so far. Gerloff dropped back to 20th place at the start, but then fought back to match the 12th place he claimed on Saturday. Van der Mark attempted to make progress from 15th on the grid but suffered a big crash on lap two and injured his leg. Baz was on course for a fine points finish until lap nine, when he too crashed out. The Frenchman was unhurt.\n\nRound four of the 2023 WorldSBK takes place in Barcelona (ESP) in two weeks, from 5th to 7th May.\n\nQuotes after the Assen races.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Michael’s crash was a sad end to a weekend, at which we witnessed a few rays of hope.

For two weeks, the 50th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON was celebrated with an entertaining programme of events, culminating in Sunday's highlight under ideal conditions and sunshine. Around one million fans along the 42.195 km route through the German capital witnessed not only an exciting men's finish but also the largest starting field ever in the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON, with 58,000 runners.\n\nAs diverse as the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON is, the Ethiopian colours dominated the podium on Sunday. In the women's race, the homeland of running legend Haile Gebrselassie celebrated a first to fourth lock-out. Favorite Tigist Ketema won convincingly ahead of Mestawot Fikir, Bosena Mulatie, and Aberu Ayana Mulisa. In the men's race, Ethiopia’s Milkesa Mengesha took a somewhat surprising victory. Kenyan Cybrian Kotut finished second, while another Ethiopian, Haymanot Alew, claimed third place.\n\n“The 50th BMW Berlin Marathon was a lively anniversary on and off the course and a compelling sporting event with more than 85,000 active participants – more than ever before. A heartfelt thank you to all athletes, the team of our partner SCC EVENTS, the 6,500 volunteers, and all the fans along the route,” said Christian Ach, Head of BMW Germany. “BMW was delighted to contribute as the title partner to the success of this event. The BMW BERLIN-MARATHON moves many of our customers and employees. It also exemplifies the BMW Group’s commitment to sports, as it creates unique moments for everyone involved, connects people from different cultures, and celebrates both diversity and inclusion.”\n\nThe race dynamics for the men and women could not have been more different. Tigist Ketema essentially led from start to finish, achieving a commanding victory. The clock on the lead vehicle, a BMW i5, stopped at 2:16:42 h – the third-fastest time ever run by a woman in Berlin. Ketema's lead over the second and third-place finishers was more than two minutes.\n\nThe male top-runners started the marathon together at a very fast pace, leading to the fastest halfway split in BMW BERLIN-MARATHON history. However, in the final quarter of the race, the pace slowed significantly as tactics came to the fore. With three kilometres remaining, the lead group was reduced to just three runners. Mengesha took the initiative and began his final sprint shortly before the Brandenburg Gate, leaving his competitors behind. He achieved a personal best time of 2:03:17 h, with Kotut finishing five seconds behind and Alew 14 seconds behind the winner. The best German finisher was Sebastian Hendel, who placed 17th with a time of 2:07:33 h, while the fastest German woman was Melat Kejeta, who finished 11th with a time of 2:23:40 h.\n\nThe most exciting finish came from the men's handbike race. In a photo finish, Vico Merklein (GER) won ahead of Michael Jørgensen (DEN), followed closely by Johannes Herter (GER, all 1:04:46 h). In the women's handbike race, Italy’s Francesca Porcellato took victory with a time of 1:17:44 h, followed by Germans Julia Dierkesmann (1:17:45 h) and Katrin Möller (1:18:47 h).\n\nMarcel Hug (1:27:18 h) was the fastest man in a racing wheelchair, as he was last year. The Swiss athlete finished ahead of David Weir (GBR, 1:29:05 h) and Geert Schipper (NED, 1:30:33 h). In the women's wheelchair race, the defending champion also prevailed; Catherine Debrunner (SUI) won in 1:35:23 h, followed by Susannah Scaroni (USA, 1:38:01 h) and Manuela Schär (SUI, 1:41:14 h).\n\nAt the 50th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON, several hundred BMW employees from around the world also participated. To get ready and in the spirit of the event, many of them gathered on Saturday at BMW Group Plant Berlin. At the BMW Runners Get-together, they prepared for the race together, embodying the marathon's spirit of bringing together people from different cultures.\n\nTitle partner BMW supported the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON with 65 electric route and organisational vehicles. The all-electric BMW i5 and BMW i4 were used as lead cars. The BMW iX2 safety car was also emission-free, as were four BMW CE 04 scooters. The marathon was a home outing for the two-wheelers that are produced at the BMW Group Plant Berlin.\n\nThe BMW Group plant in Berlin can look back on a long tradition of motorcycle manufacturing.

The clock on the lead vehicle, a BMW i5, stopped at 2:16:42 h – the third-fastest time ever run by a woman in Berlin. Ketema's lead over the second and third-place finishers was more than two minutes.\n\nThe male top-runners started the marathon together at a very fast pace, leading to the fastest halfway split in BMW BERLIN-MARATHON history. However, in the final quarter of the race, the pace slowed significantly as tactics came to the fore. With three kilometres remaining, the lead group was reduced to just three runners. Mengesha took the initiative and began his final sprint shortly before the Brandenburg Gate, leaving his competitors behind. He achieved a personal best time of 2:03:17 h, with Kotut finishing five seconds behind and Alew 14 seconds behind the winner. The best German finisher was Sebastian Hendel, who placed 17th with a time of 2:07:33 h, while the fastest German woman was Melat Kejeta, who finished 11th with a time of 2:23:40 h.\n\nThe most exciting finish came from the men's handbike race. In a photo finish, Vico Merklein (GER) won ahead of Michael Jørgensen (DEN), followed closely by Johannes Herter (GER, all 1:04:46 h). In the women's handbike race, Italy’s Francesca Porcellato took victory with a time of 1:17:44 h, followed by Germans Julia Dierkesmann (1:17:45 h) and Katrin Möller (1:18:47 h).\n\nMarcel Hug (1:27:18 h) was the fastest man in a racing wheelchair, as he was last year. The Swiss athlete finished ahead of David Weir (GBR, 1:29:05 h) and Geert Schipper (NED, 1:30:33 h). In the women's wheelchair race, the defending champion also prevailed; Catherine Debrunner (SUI) won in 1:35:23 h, followed by Susannah Scaroni (USA, 1:38:01 h) and Manuela Schär (SUI, 1:41:14 h).\n\nAt the 50th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON, several hundred BMW employees from around the world also participated. To get ready and in the spirit of the event, many of them gathered on Saturday at BMW Group Plant Berlin. At the BMW Runners Get-together, they prepared for the race together, embodying the marathon's spirit of bringing together people from different cultures.\n\nTitle partner BMW supported the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON with 65 electric route and organisational vehicles. The all-electric BMW i5 and BMW i4 were used as lead cars. The BMW iX2 safety car was also emission-free, as were four BMW CE 04 scooters. The marathon was a home outing for the two-wheelers that are produced at the BMW Group Plant Berlin.\n\nThe BMW Group plant in Berlin can look back on a long tradition of motorcycle manufacturing. BMW motorcycles have been produced in Berlin-Spandau since 1969. With over 2,400 employees and a capacity of up to 900 motorcycles and premium e-scooters per day, the plant is the heart of BMW Motorrad’s global production."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

After the 2024 season, an era comes to an end at BMW M Motorsport with Bruno Spengler (CAN) leaving after 13 years as a BMW M works driver, at his own request, to face new professional challenges. By winning the DTM title in the comeback year in 2012, he secured his place in BMW M Motorsport history books. With Spengler's departure, a true fan favourite and a great ambassador for the BMW brand is leaving .\n\nAt the end of 2011, Bruno Spengler joined BMW M Motorsport to play a key role in the brand's return to the DTM for the 2012 season. He celebrated his first victory in just the second race at the Lausitzring (GER) in his matte black BMW M3 DTM. Spengler won a total of four races in 2012 and was crowned champion in a thrilling season finale at Hockenheim (GER). At the same time, BMW M Team Schnitzer and BMW M Motorsport celebrated winning the team and manufacturer championships. The “Black Beast” became his trademark in the following years. Between 2012 and 2019, Spengler competed in 122 DTM races for BMW M Motorsport, achieving seven victories and 24 podium finishes.\n\nSpengler was also successful in GT racing. He achieved podium finishes at both the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) and the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA). In 2015, he formed a trio with Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) and Timo Glock (GER) at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), driving the now legendary BMW Z4 GT3 in Michel Vaillant design. In 2023, alongside Jens Klingmann (GER), Spengler won the title in the Italian GT Sprint Championship driving the BMW M4 GT3.

I remember well competing against him in the DTM when I was with my previous employer, Audi. Since I've been at BMW M Motorsport, I've come to know him as an extremely pleasant and valuable member of the BMW M Motorsport family, far beyond just racing. His sporting achievements speak for themselves, but his positive nature has also made him a big fan favourite to this day. I wish Bruno all the best for his professional and private future and hope to still see him at the racetrack from time to time.”\n\nBruno Spengler: “I would like to sincerely thank the entire BMW M Motorsport family, all the engineers, and all the mechanics for the past 13 years. I had the privilege of driving incredibly fantastic racing cars all over the world – it was a great time. My special thanks go to the former BMW Board Member, Dr. Klaus Draeger, who particularly supported me in my early years at BMW M Motorsport, as well as to Charly Lamm and the entire Schnitzer family, with whom I won the DTM title in 2012 and experienced many fantastic years together.

We have developed the M 1000 XR, M XR for short, based on the current S 1000 XR, S 1000 RR and M 1000 RR, as a long distance sports bike with high long-range capability and supersports riding dynamics for the road as well as the race track.\" Dominik Blass, Product Manager.\n\nBMW M 1000 XR: The long distance sports bike meets the highest demands for riding on country roads, for long-distance journeys and on the race track.\n\nThe letter M is synonymous worldwide with racing success as well as the fascination of high-performance BMW models and is aimed at customers with particularly high demands for performance, exclusivity and individuality. BMW Motorrad already introduced the successful M automobile range strategy for motorcycles in 2019 and has since been offering M special equipment and M Performance Parts. With the M RR and the M R, the first two independent M models from BMW Motorrad were introduced in the following years.\n\nThe M 1000 XR prototype, in the \"100 Years of BMW Motorrad\" anniversary year - and the almost 100-year tradition in motorsport - is a preview of a supersports motorcycle that masters the disciplines: country road, long-distance riding and racetrack use with equal aplomb at a level of performance previously unknown in this segment.\n\nIn-line four-cylinder engine with BMW ShiftCam technology and low weight delivers the highest performance in the segment.\n\nThe four-cylinder engine from the BMW S 1000 RR super sports bike with BMW ShiftCam technology for varying the timing and valve lift is used as the basis. With an engine output of more than 147 kW (200 hp), a DIN empty weight of only 223 kg fully fuelled, and chassis technology, aerodynamics and control electronics designed equally for high-performance road use, long-distance riding and fast laps on the racetrack, the new M XR opens up dynamic riding dimensions as a crossover bike in the sports motorbike segment previously reserved for purebred superbikes. Further weight reduction and even increased riding dynamics can be achieved with the M Competition Package, which is available as an optional extra ex works. The top speed of the M XR prototype is around 280 km/h.\n\nM winglets: You can ride with greater stability, benefit from a lower wheelie tendency and accelerate earlier thanks to the aerodynamic downforce.\n\nIn addition to drive and suspension technology, aerodynamics was also a key item in the specifications for developing the M XR prototype. The new M XR was given winglets with the aim of ensuring superior riding stability even at high speeds despite increased engine power. They serve in particular to achieve the best possible contact between the wheels and the road surface - especially when accelerating and at high speeds. The additional wheel load on the front wheel counteracts the wheelie tendency during acceleration, the traction control system has to regulate less, more drive power is converted into acceleration and the rider achieves a faster lap time. The specifically front-wheel-oriented seating position ensures better bike control, especially in supersport mode.\n\nM brakes with radial hand brake pump for optimum braking performance in race track and performance mode.\n\nLike the M RR and the M R, the new M XR features the M brake. It was developed directly using the experience gained with the racing brakes on BMW Motorrad factory racing machines in the Superbike World Championship. The M brake callipers feature a blue anodised coating in conjunction with the famous M logo.\n\nBMW Motorrad will publish further information on the new BMW M 1000 XR in the second half of 2023.\n\nMore impressions of the M XR prototype under:\n\nYou will find press material on BMW motorcycles and BMW Motorrad rider equipment in the BMW Group PressClub at \n\nIn case of queries please contact:\n\nDamien Cagnart, Spokesperson BMW Motorrad\n\nTim Diehl-Thiele, Head of Communications BMW Motorrad\n\nJens Lemon, Head of Communications MINI and BMW Motorrad\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2022, the BMW Group sold nearly 2.4 million passenger vehicles and more than 202,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2022 was € 23.5 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.6 billion. As of 31 December 2022, the BMW Group had a workforce of 149,475 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action.

The in-car digital experience of both the present day and the future is the dominant theme of the BMW Group’s presence at CES 2024. New infotainment products for the current BMW model portfolio will be shown at the event. At the same time, the BMW Group is demonstrating innovative development projects that offer a glimpse into the future. Visitors can teleoperate a BMW iX and guide it around the Silver Lot on the exhibition site, discover as a passenger the potential offered by augmented reality glasses during a journey and experience a new generative AI capability of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant powered by the Alexa large language model (LLM), enabling quick answers and how-to responses on vehicle features. “BMW is synonymous with both the ultimate driving machine and the ultimate digital experience,” says Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management responsible for BMW Group Development. “At the CES we are showing more content, more customisation and more gaming. This is all underpinned by our powerful, in-house developed BMW Operating System. And we will take a look to the future, of course, with perfectly integrated augmented reality and strong, reliable artificial intelligence at the interaction between human and machine.” BMW Operating System 9 makes it possible: new gaming experiences from the ConnectedDrive Store in 2024. The optional “BMW Digital Premium” offering allows BMW customers with BMW Operating System 9 to access an extended range of products from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. As well as on-demand functions for the vehicle, the store also offers an ever-evolving selection of third-party apps in the categories music & audio, news & magazines and gaming for the infotainment system. More games are now being made available via this channel for in-car enjoyment. And occupants will also be able to play using proper gaming controllers in future. BMW is presenting this new form of gaming experience for the first time at CES 2024. For example, “Beach Buggy Racing 2” offers customers an action-packed racing game that evokes memories of the great console classics. Two players in the vehicle can compete against one another in split-screen mode using their gaming controllers. Any standard gaming controller with Bluetooth capability can be connected to the infotainment system in just a few steps. The controller link-up will be made available over the air for BMW Operating System 9 during 2024. The AirConsole App already lets BMW customers play single and multiplayer games in their car. The “casual games” offered are easy to pick up for anyone; the user’s smartphone serves as a controller, allowing simple control of gameplay that is quick to learn. Additions are constantly being made to the choice of games in the in-car AirConsole App. BMW Digital Premium is optionally available for models with BMW Operating System 9 and can be obtained from the ConnectedDrive Store either online, in the MyBMW App or directly from the car. BMW Digital Premium allows customers to enjoy in-car use of all the apps available in their country as well as covering the necessary data usage. And the package offers more besides, including enhanced navigation functions and added customisation options. Top entertainment – with the Video App in BMW Operating Systems 8.5 and 9. In addition to the BMW Theatre Screen with Amazon Fire TV built-in in the rear compartment of the BMW 7 Series, BMW customers are now able to watch a variety of video content on the central display too*. The already very succesful TiVo operating system for smart TVs was optimised for in-car video streaming in the space of just a few months by developers from the BMW Group working together with XPERI Inc. The result is the integration of the DTS AutoStage Video Service powered by TiVo. The entertainment programme comprises both live channels and on-demand media libraries covering the categories news, sport, entertainment for kids, movies and TV series.\n\nFirst launched in the new BMW 5 Series, the platform will now be rolled out to further executive and luxury models over the air**. Since the end of 2023, customers driving compact models with BMW Operating System 9 have also been able to access the Video App with BMW Digital Premium. These will be followed by further models over the course of 2024, such as the BMW X2 and all models in the new MINI family. The Video App is currently accessible in the USA, UK, South Korea, France, Italy, Germany and Spain, and will soon be coming to Japan. A number of portals are available internationally, including Pluto TV, Bloomberg, TED, Yahoo! and Chili. These are accompanied by market-specific streaming services:\n\nThe portfolio of video streaming platforms will keep expanding and will be gradually rolled out to other countries. Ready for the wearables of the future – enhanced driving experience with XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses. The CES show also sees the BMW Group demonstrate for the first time how augmented reality (AR) glasses are set to enrich the driving experience in future. Visitors can test the possible uses of AR glasses for themselves on a drive through Las Vegas. Wearing the glasses, they can see how navigation instructions, hazard warnings, entertainment content, information on charging stations and supporting visualisations in parking situations are embedded perfectly into the real-world environment by the “XREAL Air 2”. AR and mixed reality (MR) devices will become increasingly popular in the next few years, thanks to technological advances and entry-level models that are more affordable for customers. In future, AR and MR devices will be able to offer both drivers and passengers enhanced information and enjoyable experiences to complement the displays fitted in the vehicle. The BMW Group has been working on the development of AR/MR technology since 2008 and investigating possible applications for head-mounted displays in research projects. The BMW engineers, together with their development partners, have now succeeded in showing stable augmented reality and mixed reality content to passengers in a dynamically moving vehicle for the first time. The displayed image remains securely embedded in the environment even in challenging driving situations, such as when turning, driving over large bumps or accelerating. To achieve this, the tracking system of the AR/MR device in question has to be linked to the vehicle’s sensor data. The BMW Group has consistently built up its pool of experience with AR/MR devices over the years and presented the results to the public. These include the initial MINI Augmented Vision project (2015), the collaboration with Meta Reality Labs (2022 & 2023), the ConnectedRide Smartglasses from BMW Motorrad and the M Mixed Reality Driving Experience. The Augmented View function in current BMW and MINI models shows drivers a live video stream on the display that is augmented with additional information for optimum guidance when using the navigation system. In the area of highly innovative, vehicle-related XR applications, the BMW Group has filed patents for almost 70 inventions from its developers in recent years. “Thanks to the recent research collaborations with Meta Reality Labs and XREAL, we have made considerable progress in our preparations for integrating external XR devices into our driving experience in production models. We are proud to be leading the way here and are well prepared to offer our customers breathtaking XR experiences in the future,” says Peter Lehnert, Vice President Research, New Technologies and Innovations Digital Car at the BMW Group. “We are thrilled at the prospect of being able to digitally embellish the real world by combining car tech with AR tech,” comments Peng Jin, co-founder of XREAL. \"And this could lead to entirely new experiences while travelling by car and open up new potential for AR tech.” The BMW Group has successfully carried out pioneering work on digital technologies in the past – such as vehicle access using the BMW Digital Key – and has been a driving force behind the industry-wide standardisation of such innovations. The company is open to collaboration with further partners in the area of AR/MR too. The goal here is to establish an industry standard for connecting the CE industry’s XR devices with vehicles. Development demo: BMW voice assistant becomes the ultimate vehicle expert with the help of the Alexa Large Language Model (LLM). At CES, the BMW Group and Amazon showcase voice assistant LLM capabilities based on a current development project that the companies are working on in preparation for a potential series rollout. This makes the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant the ultimate vehicle expert thanks to generative AI that is powered by the Alexa LLM. At CES, visitors experience how the voice assistant provides quick instructions and answers about vehicle functions in a much more human, conversation-like manner, while at the same time being able to control some vehicle functions. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has been using artificial intelligence for speech processing for a long time and this demo is the latest proof point of the continued innovation BMW and its partners are bringing to customers. Complex processing capabilities, which enable human-like interactions and dialogs, have not yet been integrated into BMW series vehicles. Such capabilities are now made possible by LLMs, which are AI models that are designed to process human language at a high level and generate responses accordingly. The BMW Group is also taking careful steps to build a safe and trusted experience for customers, and continues to test and iterate these LLM capabilities over time with its partners. Since the introduction of the first BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in 2018, language interaction has been an essential part of BMW iDrive. Today, the voice assistant gives customers control over many vehicle functions so that they can keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. Leveraging Amazon’s Alexa Custom Assistant — a solution that is based on Alexa technology and enables companies to create their own customized voice assistant — the next-generation of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant will soon become more powerful over the course of the year in vehicles with BMW Operating System 9. Joint development project with Valeo paves the way for teleoperated valet parking. The BMW Group and Valeo have entered a strategic partnership to work on the joint development of next-generation automated Level 4 parking solutions. This includes the development of solutions for automated valet parking (AVP). Here, the customer leaves their vehicle in a designated drop-off area. The vehicle then searches for a vacant parking space itself, manoeuvres into the space and later exits it again, and can even drive back to the pick-up area for collection by the driver. Either an autonomous driving system or a teleoperated valet system can be used as the underlying technology for this. CES 2024 visitors will have the opportunity to try out teleoperated valet parking for themselves. Teleoperation offers complete control in situations that could be very challenging for fully autonomous systems, such as in complex or unfamiliar environments.\n\nThe teleoperator uses sophisticated technology and live camera images to guide and move the vehicle so that it can be parked and retrieved again in a carefully controlled manner. Possible future applications for this technology could include parking at events, at airports or in the logistics sector.\n\n* In conjunction with ConnectedDrive Professional in models with BMW Operating System 8.5 or in conjunction with BMW Digital Premium with BMW Operating System 9.\n\n** BMW 7 Series; BMW iX produced from 03/23; BMW X5, BMW X6, BMW X7, BMW X5 M, BMW X6 M produced from 04/23; BMW XM produced from 08/23."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Insights into development projects for digitalised mobility of the future: integration of augmented reality glasses into the driving experience, teleoperated parking and generative AI for in-car voice assistants +++ New apps for the ConnectedDrive Store: even more video streaming and games now available in current vehicle models +++Fahrzeugmodelle +++"}]}

Development demo: BMW voice assistant becomes the ultimate vehicle expert with the help of the Alexa Large Language Model (LLM). At CES, the BMW Group and Amazon showcase voice assistant LLM capabilities based on a current development project that the companies are working on in preparation for a potential series rollout. This makes the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant the ultimate vehicle expert thanks to generative AI that is powered by the Alexa LLM. At CES, visitors experience how the voice assistant provides quick instructions and answers about vehicle functions in a much more human, conversation-like manner, while at the same time being able to control some vehicle functions. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has been using artificial intelligence for speech processing for a long time and this demo is the latest proof point of the continued innovation BMW and its partners are bringing to customers. Complex processing capabilities, which enable human-like interactions and dialogs, have not yet been integrated into BMW series vehicles. Such capabilities are now made possible by LLMs, which are AI models that are designed to process human language at a high level and generate responses accordingly. The BMW Group is also taking careful steps to build a safe and trusted experience for customers, and continues to test and iterate these LLM capabilities over time with its partners. Since the introduction of the first BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in 2018, language interaction has been an essential part of BMW iDrive. Today, the voice assistant gives customers control over many vehicle functions so that they can keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. Leveraging Amazon’s Alexa Custom Assistant — a solution that is based on Alexa technology and enables companies to create their own customized voice assistant — the next-generation of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant will soon become more powerful over the course of the year in vehicles with BMW Operating System 9. Joint development project with Valeo paves the way for teleoperated valet parking. The BMW Group and Valeo have entered a strategic partnership to work on the joint development of next-generation automated Level 4 parking solutions. This includes the development of solutions for automated valet parking (AVP). Here, the customer leaves their vehicle in a designated drop-off area. The vehicle then searches for a vacant parking space itself, manoeuvres into the space and later exits it again, and can even drive back to the pick-up area for collection by the driver. Either an autonomous driving system or a teleoperated valet system can be used as the underlying technology for this. CES 2024 visitors will have the opportunity to try out teleoperated valet parking for themselves. Teleoperation offers complete control in situations that could be very challenging for fully autonomous systems, such as in complex or unfamiliar environments.\n\nThe teleoperator uses sophisticated technology and live camera images to guide and move the vehicle so that it can be parked and retrieved again in a carefully controlled manner. Possible future applications for this technology could include parking at events, at airports or in the logistics sector.\n\n* In conjunction with ConnectedDrive Professional in models with BMW Operating System 8.5 or in conjunction with BMW Digital Premium with BMW Operating System 9.\n\n** BMW 7 Series; BMW iX produced from 03/23; BMW X5, BMW X6, BMW X7, BMW X5 M, BMW X6 M produced from 04/23; BMW XM produced from 08/23."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Generative AI, Augmented Reality and Teleoperated Parking – the Digital Experience in the BMW of the Future at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024."}]}

The in-car digital experience of both the present day and the future is the dominant theme of the BMW Group’s presence at CES 2024. New infotainment products for the current BMW model portfolio will be shown at the event. At the same time, the BMW Group is demonstrating innovative development projects that offer a glimpse into the future. Visitors can teleoperate a BMW iX and guide it around the Silver Lot on the exhibition site, discover as a passenger the potential offered by augmented reality glasses during a journey and experience a new generative AI capability of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant powered by the Alexa large language model (LLM), enabling quick answers and how-to responses on vehicle features. “BMW is synonymous with both the ultimate driving machine and the ultimate digital experience,” says Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management responsible for BMW Group Development. “At the CES we are showing more content, more customisation and more gaming. This is all underpinned by our powerful, in-house developed BMW Operating System. And we will take a look to the future, of course, with perfectly integrated augmented reality and strong, reliable artificial intelligence at the interaction between human and machine.” BMW Operating System 9 makes it possible: new gaming experiences from the ConnectedDrive Store in 2024. The optional “BMW Digital Premium” offering allows BMW customers with BMW Operating System 9 to access an extended range of products from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store. As well as on-demand functions for the vehicle, the store also offers an ever-evolving selection of third-party apps in the categories music & audio, news & magazines and gaming for the infotainment system. More games are now being made available via this channel for in-car enjoyment. And occupants will also be able to play using proper gaming controllers in future. BMW is presenting this new form of gaming experience for the first time at CES 2024. For example, “Beach Buggy Racing 2” offers customers an action-packed racing game that evokes memories of the great console classics. Two players in the vehicle can compete against one another in split-screen mode using their gaming controllers. Any standard gaming controller with Bluetooth capability can be connected to the infotainment system in just a few steps. The controller link-up will be made available over the air for BMW Operating System 9 during 2024. The AirConsole App already lets BMW customers play single and multiplayer games in their car. The “casual games” offered are easy to pick up for anyone; the user’s smartphone serves as a controller, allowing simple control of gameplay that is quick to learn. Additions are constantly being made to the choice of games in the in-car AirConsole App. BMW Digital Premium is optionally available for models with BMW Operating System 9 and can be obtained from the ConnectedDrive Store either online, in the MyBMW App or directly from the car. BMW Digital Premium allows customers to enjoy in-car use of all the apps available in their country as well as covering the necessary data usage. And the package offers more besides, including enhanced navigation functions and added customisation options. Top entertainment – with the Video App in BMW Operating Systems 8.5 and 9. In addition to the BMW Theatre Screen with Amazon Fire TV built-in in the rear compartment of the BMW 7 Series, BMW customers are now able to watch a variety of video content on the central display too*. The already very succesful TiVo operating system for smart TVs was optimised for in-car video streaming in the space of just a few months by developers from the BMW Group working together with XPERI Inc. The result is the integration of the DTS AutoStage Video Service powered by TiVo. The entertainment programme comprises both live channels and on-demand media libraries covering the categories news, sport, entertainment for kids, movies and TV series.\n\nFirst launched in the new BMW 5 Series, the platform will now be rolled out to further executive and luxury models over the air**. Since the end of 2023, customers driving compact models with BMW Operating System 9 have also been able to access the Video App with BMW Digital Premium. These will be followed by further models over the course of 2024, such as the BMW X2 and all models in the new MINI family. The Video App is currently accessible in the USA, UK, South Korea, France, Italy, Germany and Spain, and will soon be coming to Japan. A number of portals are available internationally, including Pluto TV, Bloomberg, TED, Yahoo! and Chili. These are accompanied by market-specific streaming services:\n\nThe portfolio of video streaming platforms will keep expanding and will be gradually rolled out to other countries. Ready for the wearables of the future – enhanced driving experience with XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses. The CES show also sees the BMW Group demonstrate for the first time how augmented reality (AR) glasses are set to enrich the driving experience in future. Visitors can test the possible uses of AR glasses for themselves on a drive through Las Vegas. Wearing the glasses, they can see how navigation instructions, hazard warnings, entertainment content, information on charging stations and supporting visualisations in parking situations are embedded perfectly into the real-world environment by the “XREAL Air 2”. AR and mixed reality (MR) devices will become increasingly popular in the next few years, thanks to technological advances and entry-level models that are more affordable for customers. In future, AR and MR devices will be able to offer both drivers and passengers enhanced information and enjoyable experiences to complement the displays fitted in the vehicle. The BMW Group has been working on the development of AR/MR technology since 2008 and investigating possible applications for head-mounted displays in research projects. The BMW engineers, together with their development partners, have now succeeded in showing stable augmented reality and mixed reality content to passengers in a dynamically moving vehicle for the first time. The displayed image remains securely embedded in the environment even in challenging driving situations, such as when turning, driving over large bumps or accelerating. To achieve this, the tracking system of the AR/MR device in question has to be linked to the vehicle’s sensor data. The BMW Group has consistently built up its pool of experience with AR/MR devices over the years and presented the results to the public. These include the initial MINI Augmented Vision project (2015), the collaboration with Meta Reality Labs (2022 & 2023), the ConnectedRide Smartglasses from BMW Motorrad and the M Mixed Reality Driving Experience. The Augmented View function in current BMW and MINI models shows drivers a live video stream on the display that is augmented with additional information for optimum guidance when using the navigation system. In the area of highly innovative, vehicle-related XR applications, the BMW Group has filed patents for almost 70 inventions from its developers in recent years. “Thanks to the recent research collaborations with Meta Reality Labs and XREAL, we have made considerable progress in our preparations for integrating external XR devices into our driving experience in production models. We are proud to be leading the way here and are well prepared to offer our customers breathtaking XR experiences in the future,” says Peter Lehnert, Vice President Research, New Technologies and Innovations Digital Car at the BMW Group. “We are thrilled at the prospect of being able to digitally embellish the real world by combining car tech with AR tech,” comments Peng Jin, co-founder of XREAL. \"And this could lead to entirely new experiences while travelling by car and open up new potential for AR tech.” The BMW Group has successfully carried out pioneering work on digital technologies in the past – such as vehicle access using the BMW Digital Key – and has been a driving force behind the industry-wide standardisation of such innovations.

Based on the current S 1000 XR and S 1000 RR, the product substance of the M 1000 XR - M XR for short - has been tuned to meet the specific requirements of a long-distance sports bike. The riding dynamics speak for themselves, both on the country roads as well as on the race track and on long-distance journeys\".Dominik Blass, M 1000 XR Product Manager. The new BMW M 1000 XR: the long-distance sports bike designed to meet the highest demands, from dynamic riding on country roads to long-distance touring and racing.At the end of 2018, BMW Motorrad already introduced the successful M model range strategy for motorcycles and has been offering M special equipment and M performance parts ever since. The new BMW M 1000 XR is the third M model from BMW Motorrad to celebrate its world premiere, following the M 1000 RR superbike and the dynamic M 1000 R roadster: The long-distance sports bike M 1000 XR. In the centenary year of BMW Motorrad, the dynamic philosophy of the world's most powerful letter is also applied to the new M XR: M is synonymous worldwide with racing success and the fascination of high-performance BMW models and is aimed at customers with particularly high demands for performance, exclusivity and individuality. With an engine output of 148 kW (201 hp), a DIN empty weight of only 223 kg and suspension technology and aerodynamics designed equally for high-performance country road use, extended long-distance trips and fast laps on the race track, the new M XR, as the lightest representative of this crossover segment, opens up dynamic driving dimensions previously reserved for thoroughbred superbikes. Powerful M XR 4-cylinder based on the RR engine. Even more peak power, higher torque and increased thrust and traction thanks to shorter secondary and gear ratios for maximum riding pleasure on country roads and race tracks.The new M XR features a modified water-cooled 4-cylinder in-line engine based on the power unit of the S 1000 RR. Its peak power is 148 kW (201 hp) at 12,750 rpm, 23 kW (31 hp) more than in the new S 1000 XR. The maximum torque of 113 Nm is reached at 11,000 rpm. The maximum engine speed of the M XR is 14,600 rpm. Increased rear wheel pulling power in all gears is also provided by a shorter secondary gear ratio through the use of a sprocket with now 47 teeth (S 1000 XR: 45 teeth). In addition, the gear ratios of the 4th, 5th and 6th gear are now shorter compared to the S 1000 XR, which also benefits traction at the rear wheel, acceleration and pulling power. M winglets and wind deflectors: Brake later, reduce wheelies and accelerate earlier thanks to aerodynamic downforce.In addition to drive and suspension technology, aerodynamics was also a key item in the specifications for developing the M XR. The new M XR was given winglets in the area of the front side panels with the aim of achieving even faster lap times on the race track and the best possible riding stability at high speeds, From a speed of about 100 km/h, they provide an increase in front wheel load thanks to the aerodynamic downforce generated. It increases by approx. 12 kg at 220 km/h. Chassis trimmed for performance-oriented riding on country roads and race tracks with Dynamic Damping Control (DDC), adjustable spring base, adjustable steering damper, milled-over handlebar clamp and more front-oriented tubular handlebar with laser-etched \"BMW M XR\" lettering.The suspension and chassis of the new M XR are based on the S 1000 XR with the aluminium bridge frame as the centrepiece. The M XR features upside-down forks with a 45 mm slide tube diameter at the front. The forks are equipped with so-called closed cartridge inserts, separate hydraulic piston-cylinder systems. Another new feature of the M XR is the additional adjustability of the fork's spring base in conjunction with the standard Dynamic Damping Control (DDC) suspension strut. In addition, the forks of the M XR feature an upper fork bridge with an elaborately milled-over handlebar clamp as well as a more front-oriented black aluminium tubular handlebar with lasered \"BMW M 1000 XR\" lettering. The handlebar end mirrors available as an option ex works are also new on the M XR. The fork legs have also been modified and are now designed to accommodate the new M brake callipers. Another new element of the M XR is the adjustable steering damper. M brakes with radial hand brake pump and lightweight forged aluminium wheels for optimum riding dynamics on the race track and in performance mode. Exclusive M Carbon wheels are available as part of the M Competition package or as an individual option.After the M 1000 RR and the M 1000 R, the new M XR is the third BMW motorcycle to feature an M brake. It was developed directly using the experience gained with the racing brakes on BMW Motorrad factory racing machines in the Superbike World Championship. The M brake callipers feature a blue anodised coating in conjunction with the famous M logo. Together with two 320 mm brake discs of 5 mm thickness and black anodised aluminium brake disc carriers, the brake system equipped with a new radial hand brake pump currently marks the pinnacle of brake development in the field of road-legal systems. The new M XR is already equipped with very lightweight forged aluminium wheels as standard. As part of the M Competition package, the exclusive M Carbon wheels are available with newly designed tapes on the rim. Brake Slide Assist - assists the rider when brake drifting.The Brake Slide Assist function is an important and very helpful innovation, especially for race track riders. It allows the rider to brake drift into corners with a constant slide. Instrument cluster with perfectly readable 6.5-inch TFT display, new display of the rev counter (red area) and OBD interface for M GPS Datalogger and M GPS Laptrigger that can be used via unlock code.The instrument cluster of the new M XR corresponds to the design of the M RR and also offers the M start-up animation. The extended display of the red speed range is a new feature. As optional equipment, comprehensive data material for using the M GPS Laptrigger and the M GPS Datalogger (Original BMW Motorrad Accessories) can be provided by means of an unlock code via the OBD interface of the instrument cluster. M Design and the dynamic design of the M XR signal pure performance and sportiness. Even more than the S 1000 XR, the new M XR with its optimised chassis technology and the most powerful engine to date in a dynamic long-distance sports bike from BMW Motorrad is uncompromisingly designed for sporty riding - whether on country roads, long-distance tours or on the race track. M XR - there is currently no better performing and lighter vehicle in this crossover segment. The proportions of the M XR are ultra-compact and powerful. Three-dimensional surfaces create excitement and a dynamic look. Slim, sleek and extremely aggressive, the M XR's front end is unmistakable with its new M winglets, designed as quadruple wings. The performance-oriented look of the new M XR is also reflected in the colour concept, with the body in Black combined with the M colours Light Blue, Dark Blue and Red. Uncompromising design and technology: The M XR featuring the M Competition Package.If the new M XR in standard trim is still not enough for you, the M Competition Package offers a fascinating mix of refined components for the racing technology gourmet and the aesthetically minded rider alike. In addition, this makes the new M XR another 3 kg lighter. The M Competition Package includes M Carbon wheels, M Carbon parts such as rear wheel cover with integrated chain guard, side panels, front wheel cover, inner cover and ignition/steering lock cover as well as a fully adjustable M rider footrest system, passenger footrests and the MGPS Laptrigger (unlock code).

Based on the current S 1000 XR and S 1000 RR, the product substance of the M 1000 XR - M XR for short - has been tuned to meet the specific requirements of a long-distance sports bike. The riding dynamics speak for themselves, both on the country roads as well as on the race track and on long-distance journeys\".Dominik Blass, M 1000 XR Product Manager. The new BMW M 1000 XR: the long-distance sports bike designed to meet the highest demands, from dynamic riding on country roads to long-distance touring and racing.At the end of 2018, BMW Motorrad already introduced the successful M model range strategy for motorcycles and has been offering M special equipment and M performance parts ever since. The new BMW M 1000 XR is the third M model from BMW Motorrad to celebrate its world premiere, following the M 1000 RR superbike and the dynamic M 1000 R roadster: The long-distance sports bike M 1000 XR. In the centenary year of BMW Motorrad, the dynamic philosophy of the world's most powerful letter is also applied to the new M XR: M is synonymous worldwide with racing success and the fascination of high-performance BMW models and is aimed at customers with particularly high demands for performance, exclusivity and individuality. With an engine output of 148 kW (201 hp), a DIN empty weight of only 223 kg and suspension technology and aerodynamics designed equally for high-performance country road use, extended long-distance trips and fast laps on the race track, the new M XR, as the lightest representative of this crossover segment, opens up dynamic driving dimensions previously reserved for thoroughbred superbikes. Powerful M XR 4-cylinder based on the RR engine. Even more peak power, higher torque and increased thrust and traction thanks to shorter secondary and gear ratios for maximum riding pleasure on country roads and race tracks.The new M XR features a modified water-cooled 4-cylinder in-line engine based on the power unit of the S 1000 RR. Its peak power is 148 kW (201 hp) at 12,750 rpm, 23 kW (31 hp) more than in the new S 1000 XR. The maximum torque of 113 Nm is reached at 11,000 rpm. The maximum engine speed of the M XR is 14,600 rpm. Increased rear wheel pulling power in all gears is also provided by a shorter secondary gear ratio through the use of a sprocket with now 47 teeth (S 1000 XR: 45 teeth). In addition, the gear ratios of the 4th, 5th and 6th gear are now shorter compared to the S 1000 XR, which also benefits traction at the rear wheel, acceleration and pulling power. M winglets and wind deflectors: Brake later, reduce wheelies and accelerate earlier thanks to aerodynamic downforce.In addition to drive and suspension technology, aerodynamics was also a key item in the specifications for developing the M XR. The new M XR was given winglets in the area of the front side panels with the aim of achieving even faster lap times on the race track and the best possible riding stability at high speeds, From a speed of about 100 km/h, they provide an increase in front wheel load thanks to the aerodynamic downforce generated. It increases by approx. 12 kg at 220 km/h. Chassis trimmed for performance-oriented riding on country roads and race tracks with Dynamic Damping Control (DDC), adjustable spring base, adjustable steering damper, milled-over handlebar clamp and more front-oriented tubular handlebar with laser-etched \"BMW M XR\" lettering.The suspension and chassis of the new M XR are based on the S 1000 XR with the aluminium bridge frame as the centrepiece. The M XR features upside-down forks with a 45 mm slide tube diameter at the front. The forks are equipped with so-called closed cartridge inserts, separate hydraulic piston-cylinder systems. Another new feature of the M XR is the additional adjustability of the fork's spring base in conjunction with the standard Dynamic Damping Control (DDC) suspension strut. In addition, the forks of the M XR feature an upper fork bridge with an elaborately milled-over handlebar clamp as well as a more front-oriented black aluminium tubular handlebar with lasered \"BMW M 1000 XR\" lettering. The handlebar end mirrors available as an option ex works are also new on the M XR. The fork legs have also been modified and are now designed to accommodate the new M brake callipers. Another new element of the M XR is the adjustable steering damper. M brakes with radial hand brake pump and lightweight forged aluminium wheels for optimum riding dynamics on the race track and in performance mode. Exclusive M Carbon wheels are available as part of the M Competition package or as an individual option.After the M 1000 RR and the M 1000 R, the new M XR is the third BMW motorcycle to feature an M brake. It was developed directly using the experience gained with the racing brakes on BMW Motorrad factory racing machines in the Superbike World Championship. The M brake callipers feature a blue anodised coating in conjunction with the famous M logo. Together with two 320 mm brake discs of 5 mm thickness and black anodised aluminium brake disc carriers, the brake system equipped with a new radial hand brake pump currently marks the pinnacle of brake development in the field of road-legal systems. The new M XR is already equipped with very lightweight forged aluminium wheels as standard. As part of the M Competition package, the exclusive M Carbon wheels are available with newly designed tapes on the rim. Brake Slide Assist - assists the rider when brake drifting.The Brake Slide Assist function is an important and very helpful innovation, especially for race track riders. It allows the rider to brake drift into corners with a constant slide. Instrument cluster with perfectly readable 6.5-inch TFT display, new display of the rev counter (red area) and OBD interface for M GPS Datalogger and M GPS Laptrigger that can be used via unlock code.The instrument cluster of the new M XR corresponds to the design of the M RR and also offers the M start-up animation. The extended display of the red speed range is a new feature. As optional equipment, comprehensive data material for using the M GPS Laptrigger and the M GPS Datalogger (Original BMW Motorrad Accessories) can be provided by means of an unlock code via the OBD interface of the instrument cluster. M Design and the dynamic design of the M XR signal pure performance and sportiness. Even more than the S 1000 XR, the new M XR with its optimised chassis technology and the most powerful engine to date in a dynamic long-distance sports bike from BMW Motorrad is uncompromisingly designed for sporty riding - whether on country roads, long-distance tours or on the race track. M XR - there is currently no better performing and lighter vehicle in this crossover segment. The proportions of the M XR are ultra-compact and powerful. Three-dimensional surfaces create excitement and a dynamic look. Slim, sleek and extremely aggressive, the M XR's front end is unmistakable with its new M winglets, designed as quadruple wings. The performance-oriented look of the new M XR is also reflected in the colour concept, with the body in Black combined with the M colours Light Blue, Dark Blue and Red. Uncompromising design and technology: The M XR featuring the M Competition Package.If the new M XR in standard trim is still not enough for you, the M Competition Package offers a fascinating mix of refined components for the racing technology gourmet and the aesthetically minded rider alike. In addition, this makes the new M XR another 3 kg lighter. The M Competition Package includes M Carbon wheels, M Carbon parts such as rear wheel cover with integrated chain guard, side panels, front wheel cover, inner cover and ignition/steering lock cover as well as a fully adjustable M rider footrest system, passenger footrests and the MGPS Laptrigger (unlock code).

But it is a 24-hour race, and we know that anything can happen. There are a lot of points up for grabs, and we are 38 points behind the leader. Can we win the world championship? We have to try to win, and then we will also need a bit of luck in terms of the results of the other teams. But I am feeling confident.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The test day was really good. Our riders rode very well. We made some changes to prepare for qualifying and the lap times are looking strong. At the test, there were no transponders but I am sure that we are within the top three. Our riders are quite happy. Of course we still have some things on the list where we can further improve. That’s our homework now and then we are ready for the qualifying and the race.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger: “We enter the final race of the season highly motivated. The track is a high-speed circuit, which should suit our bike. We have a powerful engine and good aerodynamics, which worked in our favour last year when we secured the pole position. Our recent test here was also quite promising. We were able to further optimise our bike, experimented a lot, and will continue working to get the best package for the weekend. We still have a chance to become world champions. Our goal is to secure the pole position and, in the race, at least make it to the podium, but preferably take the victory. However, endurance races are always unique, and the track is demanding on both the machine and the rider. Many things can happen, but we are hopeful for a successful race and bringing the title home for BMW.”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik: “I am looking forward to the race. The feeling on test day was quite good. The bike worked well and the performance of the tyres was also not bad. Overall, all was good, all riders have been fast. Now we just have to find something extra to be more constant in the race. We just want to do our best in the final race, we try to fight until the end and to see where we can finish and what we can do.”\n\nJérémy Guarnoni: “This weekend will be really important for us. We have two goals: we want to win the race and if we are successful we probably can be world champions. So it’s only about to go really full gas all week and in the race, and to have clean and trouble-free 24 hours.”\n\nLoris Baz: “I am really happy to be here at the Bol d’Or and help the guys.

We still have a chance to become world champions. Our goal is to secure the pole position and, in the race, at least make it to the podium, but preferably take the victory.

The bike worked well and the performance of the tyres was also not bad. Overall, all was good, all riders have been fast. Now we just have to find something extra to be more constant in the race. We just want to do our best in the final race, we try to fight until the end and to see where we can finish and what we can do.”\n\nJérémy Guarnoni: “This weekend will be really important for us.

It’s really cool to be here.”\n\nArnaud Sassone, Team Manager Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team: “We are feeling confident. We have everything in place. We know that the motorcycle is the most powerful bike in the field and our riders are in top form.

Werner Daemen’s (BEL) BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is in third place overall as they head to the South of France, making them one of the main players in the race for the title. In the Superstock class, Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team is also in a promising position.\n\nThe factory riders Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Jérémy Guarnoni (FRA) on the #37 BMW M 1000 RR of BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team started the season with two podium positions. They finished both the 24-hour race at Le Mans (FRA) and the one at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) in third place. At the Suzuka 8-hour race, the team finished in an excellent sixth place, making them the best European team.\n\nIn the world championship standings, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is in third place going into the finale, trailing the leaders by just 38 points. The number of points awarded at the Bol d’Or will by multiplied by a factor of 1.5. This means that the winning team will receive 60 points, and there will be 49.5 points for second place and 42 points for third place. In addition, further points will be awarded to the best teams in the interim standings after eight and 16 hours. There will also be points for the top positions in qualifying.\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team used the private day of testing at Le Castellet on Tuesday to make their final preparations for the finale. In addition to regular riders Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Guarnoni, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory rider Loris Baz (FRA) will also be at the Bol d’Or as the fourth rider.\n\nIn the Superstock class of the FIM Endurance World Cup, the new Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team with the #9 BMW M 1000 RR had a perfect start to their maiden season when Kenny Foray (FRA), Jan Bühn (GER) and Loïc Arbel (FRA) won the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Going into the finale, the team, managed by Arnaud Sassone (FRA), which is collaborating with Werner Daemen’s company Motorcycle Racing Parts and with BMW Motorrad Motorsport, is in fourth place in the Superstock class. They are just 16 points off first place.

In addition to BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team, the privateer BMW teams LRP Poland, TONE RT SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW and Seigneur Motorsport Team Mont Blanc will also be contesting the Bol d’Or.\n\nQuotes ahead of the Bol d’Or.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are full of confidence as we eagerly await the season finale. We did some testing recently and had some strong performances. We are very well prepared, and I am convinced that we have the pace to win the Bol d’Or. But it is a 24-hour race, and we know that anything can happen. There are a lot of points up for grabs, and we are 38 points behind the leader. Can we win the world championship? We have to try to win, and then we will also need a bit of luck in terms of the results of the other teams. But I am feeling confident.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The test day was really good. Our riders rode very well. We made some changes to prepare for qualifying and the lap times are looking strong. At the test, there were no transponders but I am sure that we are within the top three. Our riders are quite happy. Of course we still have some things on the list where we can further improve. That’s our homework now and then we are ready for the qualifying and the race.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger: “We enter the final race of the season highly motivated. The track is a high-speed circuit, which should suit our bike. We have a powerful engine and good aerodynamics, which worked in our favour last year when we secured the pole position.

Now, we are taking Sheer Driving Pleasure to a whole new level. In short: The NEUE KLASSE is more BMW than ever.\n\nAnd the next highlight is already waiting in the wings. Early next year, we will unveil the second model of the NEUE KLASSE – a sporty sedan at the very core of the brand:\n\nthe new all-electric BMW i3.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nFrom the drivetrain to battery technology and driving dynamics, from the operating system to the digital user experience: We’ve elevated every single aspect to the next level for the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nWith this new design language, we’ve even skipped a whole generation. And there's no one better to explain how our customers will experience this with all their senses than Adrian van Hooydonk.\n\nSpeech Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design\n\nWelcome ladies and gentlemen!\n\nYes, the big moment has finally come. As Oliver mentioned, with the Neue Klasse we are taking very big steps in technology. These bigger steps in technology can only become meaningful hand in hand with big steps in design. The BMW iX3 has a much bigger range helped by a very clean shape with excellent aerodynamics.\n\nIn the interior you will find a new display concept that allowed us to clean-up the dashboard and completely redefine the driving experience.\n\nBut let‘s look at the exterior design first: We have typical solid BMW SAV proportions with a lot of presence and emphasis on all four wheels. The surfaces are very clean with only a few precise lines. The front-end shows a new interpretation of the BMW typical face in which we replace chrome with light. Vertically oriented kidneys match the more upright overall appearance of our SAV. This new light signature is part of the daytime running light and it will make the new BMW iX3 very recognizable by day and by night. Overall, the car has a very solid stance and strong shoulders and, in the rear, again a new light signature that emphasizes the width of the car.\n\nIn the interior you will find that the driving experience is and will remain our focus, putting the driver at ease and in control! The key element to this is our all-new BMW Panoramic Vision which projects in the bottom of the windscreen and builds upon our years of experience with head-up displays. This new display is visible for all passengers on board and will allow you to quickly check the information you want and need while keeping your hands on the wheel and your focus on the road ahead. Together with our new free cut central display and iconic steering wheel these elements are the corner stones of our new Panoramic\n\niDrive system, a whole new driving experience that you will find in all our future BMW models from now on!\n\nThis new user experience already starts when you approach the car and continues as you get in and set the car up to your personal preferences. With My Modes you can do that very easily and select a perfectly curated driving experience – from screen content or colors to light and sound and even driving characteristics.\n\nSo, our new Operating System X focuses on the best driving experience but will also allow you a much higher level of personalization making your new BMW truly yours! Overall, the new digital aspects of our cars will make them more intelligent and easier to use.\n\nAt the same time, this has allowed us to design much cleaner and warmer interiors, creating very personal living environments on four wheels. The interior trim “Digital White” is spacious and modern.\n\nSo, starting with the BMW iX3 we are introducing a new form language that will lead to a new look and feel for the entire BMW brand.

And regarding the drivetrain, MINI customers of course have the choice between all-electric or highly efficient combustion engines.\n\nClever use of space, wheels at the corner, go-cart feeling, combined with true Britishness and maximum individuality. That's how MINI became the world's most successful premium small car brand. Driving a MINI has always been a confident personal statement. In this way, MINI has inspired numerous celebrities and designers throughout its 66-years long history.\n\nAnd today, we are writing the next exciting chapter in this tradition. Partnering with a brand that stands for customization and thinking out of the box like few others. I am talking about Deus Ex Machina!\n\nThe outcome of this inspiring and exceptional partnership are two stunning John Cooper Works models – fraternal twins with very different styles, yet united by a shared enthusiasm.\n\nI brought one of them with me today, so, let’s have a look.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n“The Skeg.” A distinctive and contemporary re-interpretation of MINI's racing history. Pure. Bold. Innovative. This artwork on four wheels is based on the MINI John Cooper Works Electric. Inspired by the world of surfing, it offers pure electric freedom to enjoy the MINI go-cart feeling on coastal roads.\n\nHis twin – “The Machina” – is forged on the racetrack. Lean, fast and powered by a combustion engine, it embodies raw racing technology and authentic functionality.\n\nTogether, they stand for individual lifestyle and maximum driving excitement, regardless of the respective drive train.\n\nSimilar to what our customers can experience with the New MINI Family, which is winning over new and old customers worldwide.\n\nThat is especially true for our fully electric models. Today, already one in three MINIs has an electric heart. And the trend continues to rise.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nCollaborations like the one with Deus Ex Machina are just one example for unique customization – the way only MINI can do.\n\nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, to something completely different.\n\nSpeech Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is a great pleasure for me to present the BMW Motorrad Vision CE. It offers the most spectacular insight into our vision of future of urban\n\ne-mobility that we have ever developed. For me, the Vision CE is a clear proof to our ambition to shape the future of emission-free mobility with courage and a pioneering spirit.\n\nHighly innovative single-track urban mobility has been strongly anchored in the history of BMW Motorrad for decades. We revolutionized urban mobility already 25 years ago with the unique BMW C1. In 2014, we were the first manufacturer to combine outstanding design with an e-drive in the BMW C evolution. In 2022, we launched the CE 04, a design & technology masterpiece of emission-free mobility which remains the global market leader in its segment to this day.\n\nAt BMW Motorrad, the development of single-track e-mobility clearly stands for visionary concepts, innovation leadership and groundbreaking design. With the Vision CE's special self-balancing system, we are looking to the future and setting again new standards: Urban riding fun on two wheels without having to wear a helmet or motorcycle clothing, thanks to the unique structural bracket design.\n\nThe Vision CE – one like no other: Exciting and inspiring - just like BMW Motorrad!\n\nSpeech Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nAt the BMW Group, we are constantly reshaping mobility – just as we have for nearly 110 years. Our customers’ individual needs, wishes – and, yes, their dreams – are always at the heart of all our brands.\n\nAll of our customers benefit from our innovative approaches and the latest technologies.

Now, we are taking Sheer Driving Pleasure to a whole new level. In short: The NEUE KLASSE is more BMW than ever.\n\nAnd the next highlight is already waiting in the wings. Early next year, we will unveil the second model of the NEUE KLASSE – a sporty sedan at the very core of the brand:\n\nthe new all-electric BMW i3.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nFrom the drivetrain to battery technology and driving dynamics, from the operating system to the digital user experience: We’ve elevated every single aspect to the next level for the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nWith this new design language, we’ve even skipped a whole generation. And there's no one better to explain how our customers will experience this with all their senses than Adrian van Hooydonk.\n\nSpeech Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design\n\nWelcome ladies and gentlemen!\n\nYes, the big moment has finally come. As Oliver mentioned, with the Neue Klasse we are taking very big steps in technology. These bigger steps in technology can only become meaningful hand in hand with big steps in design. The BMW iX3 has a much bigger range helped by a very clean shape with excellent aerodynamics.\n\nIn the interior you will find a new display concept that allowed us to clean-up the dashboard and completely redefine the driving experience.\n\nBut let‘s look at the exterior design first: We have typical solid BMW SAV proportions with a lot of presence and emphasis on all four wheels. The surfaces are very clean with only a few precise lines. The front-end shows a new interpretation of the BMW typical face in which we replace chrome with light. Vertically oriented kidneys match the more upright overall appearance of our SAV. This new light signature is part of the daytime running light and it will make the new BMW iX3 very recognizable by day and by night. Overall, the car has a very solid stance and strong shoulders and, in the rear, again a new light signature that emphasizes the width of the car.\n\nIn the interior you will find that the driving experience is and will remain our focus, putting the driver at ease and in control! The key element to this is our all-new BMW Panoramic Vision which projects in the bottom of the windscreen and builds upon our years of experience with head-up displays. This new display is visible for all passengers on board and will allow you to quickly check the information you want and need while keeping your hands on the wheel and your focus on the road ahead. Together with our new free cut central display and iconic steering wheel these elements are the corner stones of our new Panoramic\n\niDrive system, a whole new driving experience that you will find in all our future BMW models from now on!\n\nThis new user experience already starts when you approach the car and continues as you get in and set the car up to your personal preferences. With My Modes you can do that very easily and select a perfectly curated driving experience – from screen content or colors to light and sound and even driving characteristics.\n\nSo, our new Operating System X focuses on the best driving experience but will also allow you a much higher level of personalization making your new BMW truly yours! Overall, the new digital aspects of our cars will make them more intelligent and easier to use.\n\nAt the same time, this has allowed us to design much cleaner and warmer interiors, creating very personal living environments on four wheels. The interior trim “Digital White” is spacious and modern.\n\nSo, starting with the BMW iX3 we are introducing a new form language that will lead to a new look and feel for the entire BMW brand. Our designs will be very clean and at the same time very strong in character, but above all: more BMW than ever!\n\nSpeech Jochen Goller, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Customer, Brands, Sales\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nLet’s now move on to MINI, which celebrated its very own game-changing moment already last year with the introduction of a completely new product range.\n\nThe “New MINI Family”, covering the most desirable and broad product portfolio in the brand's history, now features four very distinct models - Convertible, Cooper, Aceman and Countryman. And regarding the drivetrain, MINI customers of course have the choice between all-electric or highly efficient combustion engines.\n\nClever use of space, wheels at the corner, go-cart feeling, combined with true Britishness and maximum individuality. That's how MINI became the world's most successful premium small car brand. Driving a MINI has always been a confident personal statement. In this way, MINI has inspired numerous celebrities and designers throughout its 66-years long history.\n\nAnd today, we are writing the next exciting chapter in this tradition. Partnering with a brand that stands for customization and thinking out of the box like few others. I am talking about Deus Ex Machina!\n\nThe outcome of this inspiring and exceptional partnership are two stunning John Cooper Works models – fraternal twins with very different styles, yet united by a shared enthusiasm.\n\nI brought one of them with me today, so, let’s have a look.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n“The Skeg.” A distinctive and contemporary re-interpretation of MINI's racing history. Pure. Bold. Innovative. This artwork on four wheels is based on the MINI John Cooper Works Electric. Inspired by the world of surfing, it offers pure electric freedom to enjoy the MINI go-cart feeling on coastal roads.\n\nHis twin – “The Machina” – is forged on the racetrack. Lean, fast and powered by a combustion engine, it embodies raw racing technology and authentic functionality.\n\nTogether, they stand for individual lifestyle and maximum driving excitement, regardless of the respective drive train.\n\nSimilar to what our customers can experience with the New MINI Family, which is winning over new and old customers worldwide.\n\nThat is especially true for our fully electric models. Today, already one in three MINIs has an electric heart. And the trend continues to rise.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nCollaborations like the one with Deus Ex Machina are just one example for unique customization – the way only MINI can do.\n\nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, to something completely different.\n\nSpeech Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is a great pleasure for me to present the BMW Motorrad Vision CE. It offers the most spectacular insight into our vision of future of urban\n\ne-mobility that we have ever developed. For me, the Vision CE is a clear proof to our ambition to shape the future of emission-free mobility with courage and a pioneering spirit.\n\nHighly innovative single-track urban mobility has been strongly anchored in the history of BMW Motorrad for decades. We revolutionized urban mobility already 25 years ago with the unique BMW C1. In 2014, we were the first manufacturer to combine outstanding design with an e-drive in the BMW C evolution. In 2022, we launched the CE 04, a design & technology masterpiece of emission-free mobility which remains the global market leader in its segment to this day.\n\nAt BMW Motorrad, the development of single-track e-mobility clearly stands for visionary concepts, innovation leadership and groundbreaking design. With the Vision CE's special self-balancing system, we are looking to the future and setting again new standards: Urban riding fun on two wheels without having to wear a helmet or motorcycle clothing, thanks to the unique structural bracket design.\n\nThe Vision CE – one like no other: Exciting and inspiring - just like BMW Motorrad!\n\nSpeech Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nAt the BMW Group, we are constantly reshaping mobility – just as we have for nearly 110 years. Our customers’ individual needs, wishes – and, yes, their dreams – are always at the heart of all our brands.\n\nAll of our customers benefit from our innovative approaches and the latest technologies. At the same time, we are steering the company on a long-term path that is in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThis is the spirit that drives us at the BMW Group."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Speech"}]}

The Sport variant captivates thanks to a finish in Marina Bay Blue metallic with outsized “46” graphics in Tanzanite Blue metallic and bright yellow accents on the BMW M kidney grille, the brake calipers and the forged light-alloy wheels. In the “Style” design variant, the bodywork comes in matte Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic, with the “46” in Frozen Marina Bay Blue metallic. The carbon-fibre roof of both variants is adorned with the VR46 logo and Rossi’s signature. Both the bonnet and the roof were manufactured and individually painted at BMW Group Plant Landshut. The component plant also provided the lightweight high-precision struts for the engine compartment and engine parts such as the crankcase and the cylinder head, which were installed in the high-performance drive system at BMW Group Plant Steyr.\n\nSpecial production processes at BMW Group Werk DingolfingThe production of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 reveals the impressive levels of flexibility and skill applied to manufacturing exclusive small-batch series at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. The Jeff Koons edition models for the BMW 8 Series and the 50 examples of the BMW 3.0 CSL first saw the light of day at the Bavarian plant, where high-tech manufacturing and craftsmanship go hand in hand, in the paint shop in particular.\n\nFor the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, an underlying colour tone was applied as primer before the cars were removed from the series production process. The entire paintwork surface was then sanded down to improve the adhesion of the subsequent paint layers. The paintwork experts in Dingolfing then applied specially-made stencils to mask the “46” and other design elements, such as the bright yellow lines on the rear end and the A-column, before adding the contrast colour to the masking film. Once all the layers of paint had dried and the masking film had been removed, a clear varnish coating was added to the design area by hand and then sanded down – after drying again – to guarantee seamless transitions and a flawless surface. The cars then returned to the regular series production process to receive another layer of clear varnish and for the installation of the carbon-fibre roof that was manufactured in Landshut. Overall, each car required 20 hours’ work from a small team of four hand-picked paint experts to complete the exclusive BMW Individual paint finish on the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46.\n\nVehicle assembly: components and interior characterised by VR46The next step in the production process took the edition cars to Dingolfing for assembly. The exclusive design is also reflected in the installed components, such as the bumpers specially painted in Landshut, and on the inside of the car. Night Blue dominates in the interior, with yellow accents. The M Carbon bucket seats have a shoulder area in Sao Paulo Yellow, with yellow contrast stitching and a yellow centre marker on the steering wheel. The headrests and door sill trims feature a prominent yellow VR46 logo, while the carbon-fibre centre console of all examples features a “1/46” badge. Having passed extensive quality controls, the cars of this exclusive edition are now ready for delivery to the two sets of 46 customers around the world.\n\nIncludes a “once in a lifetime” experience for customersCustomers who purchase one of the 405 kW/550 HP BMW M4 CS Edition VR46s also enjoy the added value of a “once in a lifetime” experience: an exclusive personal meeting with Valentino Rossi at his home, the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia (ITA), and a BMW M Driving Experience with current BMW M models at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli. Rossi, at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3, won GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup races at his home circuit in both 2023 and 2024 and is aiming to complete a hat-trick this year. “The Doctor” has been a BMW M works driver since the start of the 2023 season, plying his trade at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 for BMW M Team WRT, having called time on his motorcycle career at the 2021 season finale and turned his attention solely to car racing. He had already attended multiple tests in Formula 1 race cars and made guest appearances in rallies and endurance races. The Italian has been competing as a BMW M works driver in the GT World Challenge Europe, with the 24 Hours of Spa (BEL) as a highlight, as well as racing in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) or at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), where he celebrated second place in the BMW M4 GT3 at the opening round of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC).\n\nCreating a legend on two wheels“Il Dottore” had already become a living legend and global motorsport and style icon on two wheels. With nine world championships and no fewer than 115 Grand Prix victories to his name, he is one of the three most successful motorcycle racers in history. Rossi claimed his first world title in the 125cc class in 1997. Two years later, he added the title in the 250cc class. In 2000, he took the step up to what was the top Grand Prix category, the 500cc class, in which he was crowned world champion in 2001. Rossi remained the dominant force when this category was replaced by the MotoGP class the following year. By 2005 he had added a further four world titles, and numbers eight and nine were to follow in 2008 and 2009. VR46 became a world-famous trademark – and Rossi’s home town of Tavullia even reduced its speed limit from the usual 50 km/h to 46 km/h in his honour.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption and emission figures:Fuel consumption combined: 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 232 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Exclusive edition model in collaboration with BMW M works driver Valentino Rossi is limited to two sets of 46 cars +++ BMW Group Plant Dingolfing produces BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, combining large-scale efficiency with manufacturing processes +++"}]}

The next generation of the MINI family is now being launched with the MINI Cooper Electric. The new edition of the iconic MINI 3-door is geared towards electric driving fun and is available at two power levels. With its thrillingly agile drive, the MINI Cooper Electric stands for locally emission-free premium mobility of the future. Originally launched in 2020, the all-electric MINI Cooper SE saw a 25.5 per cent increase in sales in 2022 to become by far the most popular MINI model, with over 43,000 units of the locally emission-free MINI being sold worldwide last year. One out of five MINI on the road now is electrically powered. The enormous ongoing success of the original MINI was recently demonstrated by the production anniversary of the one millionth MINI 3-door of the current – fourth – generation. Likewise fully electric, the vehicle was delivered to Canada. Electrified go-kart feeling with maximum torque right from the get-go. In the new MINI family, full torque is available from the get-go in both the MINI Cooper E with an output of 135 kW and the MINI Cooper SE with 160 kW. It accelerates without delay and without shift interruptions. The lithium-ion high-voltage battery is installed in the floor of the MINI Cooper Electric for optimum road holding and weight distribution, while also increasing the vehicle’s stability and agility. In this way, MINI redefines the brand’s hallmark go-kart feeling, consistently perpetuating the concept of urban driving fun that has been so successful for more than 60 years. MINI was able to draw on development expertise within the BMW Group in order to achieve further improved driving dynamics in the new MINI Cooper Electric. The vehicle has been firmly anchored in the company’s brand history from the market launch of the redesigned generation of the MINI 3-door in 2001 through to the upcoming fifth model generation. Continuous advancement in the areas of technology, efficiency and power delivery reflects careful handling of the popular MINI model’s tradition-steeped history and now once again raises driving fun to a new level. Improved range and maximum flexibility The battery capacity in the MINI Cooper E is 40.7 kWh, while in the MINI Cooper SE it is 54.2 kWh. This gives the new models a predicted range of between 300 and 400 kilometres, thereby noticeably extending the radius for excursions within the urban setting and beyond. With its hallmark MINI space concept, the MINI Cooper Electric demonstrates the maximum flexibility of a purpose-built vehicle. Offering maximum variability, the design of the interior allows the luggage compartment volume to be expanded and includes four seats.

Hydrogen as a sustainable source of energy and movement is the central theme of BMW's program at this year's Art Basel in Basel. BMW, which has been a partner of Art Basel for 20 years, has commissioned London-based artist Es Devlin to create a series of multi-media works which will be unveiled on 10 June. In Hall 1.1 of the art fair Devlin has created a booth displaying four works: Surfacing (2024), Surfacing II (2024), Mask (2018), and Mask in Motion (2018). As an opening chapter, Devlin and BMW also present a series of mobile sound installations within a pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles* which have been enveloped in prints of Devlin’s collaged paintings. Passengers are invited to listen in on the artist’s conversation with BMW engineers about the potential of hydrogen.\n\n“The works on innovation and mobility created by Es Devlin for Art Basel offer an impressive example of how technology can serve as inspiration for art,” says Michael Rath, Head of Hydrogen Vehicles, BMW Group. “We are very proud of the radiance of the BMW Group's pioneering hydrogen technology.”\n\nThe BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Pioneer and trailblazer of BMW’s technological expertise.As a versatile energy source, hydrogen will play a key role in the energy transition and thus in climate protection. The BMW iX5 Hydrogen combines the advantages of locally emission-free electric drive with the driving pleasure typical of the brand. Another advantage: the quick and uncomplicated refuelling process. The company is currently testing the vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology in selected countries under everyday conditions. The world tour of the pilot fleet will now make a stop at Art Basel 2024, where the innovative hydrogen vehicles will be available as a shuttle service.\n\nFor the BMW Group, the pilot project is an expression of its open-technology approach to the mobility of tomorrow. The hydrogen fuel cell technology provides an additional supplement to battery-electric drive systems.\n\nThe powertrain of the vehicle developed on the basis of the BMW X5 consists of an innovative combination of fuel cells with an output of 125 kW/170 hp, which uses energy from gaseous hydrogen to drive an electric motor from the BMW Group's Gen 5 programme together with a specially developed battery. This generates a maximum system output of 285 kW/401 hp. The hydrogen tanks of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen can be refuelled within three to four minutes and enable a range of 504 kilometres according to the WLTP test cycle.\n\nEs Devlin to create a series of multi-media works which will be unveiled on 10 June at Art Basel in Basel 2024.In Hall 1.1 of the art fair Devlin has created a booth displaying four works: Surfacing (2024), an illuminated cube of rain penetrated by a line of light and Surfacing II (2024), a pair of painted televisions in which a dancing figure appears to displace pixels and pigment, are flanked by Mask (2018) a projection-mapped model city fusing hands and river, and Mask in Motion (2018) a revolving illuminated translucent printed city which meshes viewers within its kinetic shadow.\n\nEach work continues Devlin's 30 year exploration of the entangled dance between humans and technology. The booth surprises visitors each hour as Surfacing's box of rain, like a magician's apparatus, conjures a 7 minute dance work by renowned Paris-based choreographer Sharon Eyal with music composed by London-based duo Polyphonia.\n\nA meeting of artist and engineers.Devlin has spent the past year engaging with engineers at BMW, learning the mechanics behind the hydrogen fuel cell technology and its implications for the future of sustainable energy systems. As an opening chapter to the works on view in Hall 1.1, she has created a simple soundscape drawn from their conversations and underscored by composers Polyphonia which is played to guests in the pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles.\n\nDevlin says: “I learned from the BMW engineers the beautiful symmetry of the system at work within the hydrogen fuel cell: the energy that is used to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen is recreated when the oxygen is reunited with hydrogen within the car. The by-product is not only the energy which propels the vehicle, but water.”\n\nThe exterior of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen has been wrapped in a painted blue and white collage in which Devlin overlays paintings and text made in response to the prints and literature which populated her wall and bookshelves as a teenager. Painted gestures echoing the 1831 woodcut ‘The Great Wave off Kanagawa’ by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, are superimposed over hand written extracts from literature’s longest sentence about water drawn from James Joyce’s seminal novel ‘Ulysses’. Underlying the collage are excerpts from BMW Group publications on hydrogen fuel cell technology.\n\nSURFACING.Visitors can sign up to book their seat at the hourly rituals here.Thursday, 13 June - Sunday, 16 June 2024Art Basel in Basel, Hall 1.1Messeplatz 10, 4005 Basel, Switzerland\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 1,19 kg H2/100 km, CO2 emissions combined in WLTP cycle: 0 g/kmElectric range: 504 km (313 miles)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hydrogen as a sustainable source of energy and movement is the central theme of BMW's program at this year's Art Basel in Basel.

Passengers are invited to listen in on the artist’s conversation with BMW engineers about the potential of hydrogen.\n\n“The works on innovation and mobility created by Es Devlin for Art Basel offer an impressive example of how technology can serve as inspiration for art,” says Michael Rath, Head of Hydrogen Vehicles, BMW Group. “We are very proud of the radiance of the BMW Group's pioneering hydrogen technology.”\n\nThe BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Pioneer and trailblazer of BMW’s technological expertise.As a versatile energy source, hydrogen will play a key role in the energy transition and thus in climate protection. The BMW iX5 Hydrogen combines the advantages of locally emission-free electric drive with the driving pleasure typical of the brand. Another advantage: the quick and uncomplicated refuelling process. The company is currently testing the vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology in selected countries under everyday conditions. The world tour of the pilot fleet will now make a stop at Art Basel 2024, where the innovative hydrogen vehicles will be available as a shuttle service.\n\nFor the BMW Group, the pilot project is an expression of its open-technology approach to the mobility of tomorrow. The hydrogen fuel cell technology provides an additional supplement to battery-electric drive systems.\n\nThe powertrain of the vehicle developed on the basis of the BMW X5 consists of an innovative combination of fuel cells with an output of 125 kW/170 hp, which uses energy from gaseous hydrogen to drive an electric motor from the BMW Group's Gen 5 programme together with a specially developed battery. This generates a maximum system output of 285 kW/401 hp. The hydrogen tanks of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen can be refuelled within three to four minutes and enable a range of 504 kilometres according to the WLTP test cycle.\n\nEs Devlin to create a series of multi-media works which will be unveiled on 10 June at Art Basel in Basel 2024.In Hall 1.1 of the art fair Devlin has created a booth displaying four works: Surfacing (2024), an illuminated cube of rain penetrated by a line of light and Surfacing II (2024), a pair of painted televisions in which a dancing figure appears to displace pixels and pigment, are flanked by Mask (2018) a projection-mapped model city fusing hands and river, and Mask in Motion (2018) a revolving illuminated translucent printed city which meshes viewers within its kinetic shadow.\n\nEach work continues Devlin's 30 year exploration of the entangled dance between humans and technology. The booth surprises visitors each hour as Surfacing's box of rain, like a magician's apparatus, conjures a 7 minute dance work by renowned Paris-based choreographer Sharon Eyal with music composed by London-based duo Polyphonia.\n\nA meeting of artist and engineers.Devlin has spent the past year engaging with engineers at BMW, learning the mechanics behind the hydrogen fuel cell technology and its implications for the future of sustainable energy systems. As an opening chapter to the works on view in Hall 1.1, she has created a simple soundscape drawn from their conversations and underscored by composers Polyphonia which is played to guests in the pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles.\n\nDevlin says: “I learned from the BMW engineers the beautiful symmetry of the system at work within the hydrogen fuel cell: the energy that is used to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen is recreated when the oxygen is reunited with hydrogen within the car. The by-product is not only the energy which propels the vehicle, but water.”\n\nThe exterior of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen has been wrapped in a painted blue and white collage in which Devlin overlays paintings and text made in response to the prints and literature which populated her wall and bookshelves as a teenager. Painted gestures echoing the 1831 woodcut ‘The Great Wave off Kanagawa’ by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, are superimposed over hand written extracts from literature’s longest sentence about water drawn from James Joyce’s seminal novel ‘Ulysses’. Underlying the collage are excerpts from BMW Group publications on hydrogen fuel cell technology.\n\nSURFACING.Visitors can sign up to book their seat at the hourly rituals here.Thursday, 13 June - Sunday, 16 June 2024Art Basel in Basel, Hall 1.1Messeplatz 10, 4005 Basel, Switzerland\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 1,19 kg H2/100 km, CO2 emissions combined in WLTP cycle: 0 g/kmElectric range: 504 km (313 miles)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

These days marks the 60th anniversary of one of the most spectacular successes in the history of international motorsport. With Irishman Patrick “Paddy” Hopkirk at the wheel, the Mini Cooper S won the overall standings of the Monte Carlo Rally. Happiness? Coincidence? A quirk of fate? Probably not, because two more victories followed at the Monte Carlo Rally and numerous other successes until the end of the 1960s. Looking back, the reasons for this were: modern technology, top drivers and new logistics standards.\n\n\"Paddy Hopkirk's victory in the Mini Cooper S in 1964 marked a turning point in the history of Mini. It proved that the classic Mini was not only a charming city car, but also a successful car in motorsport. This tradition and passion for racing is in our legacy and can still be felt in our models today. Motorsport has shaped Mini and will always remain an important part of our DNA,\" says Stefanie Wurst, Head of MINI.\n\nBlueprint for modern small cars.\n\nAt the end of the 1950s, the rally greats mostly moved in stately and lavishly motorized vehicles through English forests, over French passes or from Liège to Sofia and back again. Austin Healey and Ford Falcon were the benchmark at the rallies and dominated the scene. They weren't really suitable for everyday use. During this time, Alec Issigonis, on behalf of the British Motor Corporation (BMC), built the the most modern car of its time: with its transverse engine and front-wheel drive, the classic Mini met the standard for small cars that is still valid today when it debuted in 1959.\n\nAn impressive sports career required a second brilliant car guy: John Cooper. He had achieved fame as a racing driver and wealth as a designer - and he was immediately convinced of the sporting potential of the classic Mini. Cooper, who in his Formula 1 cars did not place the engine in front of the driver, as was usual at the time, but behind him, summed it up to his friend Issigonis, who saw the classic Mini as more of a car for everyone: “That's a damn race car. Give it more power, improve the brakes and build the thing.” The underestimated underdog – a role that MINI has been happy to take on again and again in its more than six decade history – was born.\n\n64 years of the brand, 62 years of motorsport.\n\nThe first Mini Cooper was created in 1960 - with an impressive 55 horsepower instead of the 34 horsepower of the original Mini from 1959. As early as 1961, the Mini Cooper, which was just three meters long, turned the world of high-speed drivers upside down. From now on, even the less well-off could tile across the country at least as quickly as the owners of pure sports cars and high-horsepower limousines. And on the rally trails and racing tracks, the little racers with their almost delicate ten-inch wheels won the trophies.\n\nThe classic Mini Cooper was tailor-made for the rally routes of the time. Hardly any body overhangs ensured a previously unknown neutral driving behavior.\n\nAnd thanks to the rather modest 650 kilos that a Rallye Mini weighed at the time, the power-to-weight ratio was quite acceptable with the modest 55 hp. This construction was to become the origin of the famous go-kart feeling.\n\nIn May 1962, the classic Mini entered the winners' list of an international rally event for the first time. At the International Tulip Rally, which led from the Dutch municipality of Noordwijk to the French Riviera and back again, Pat Moss, sister of the four-time vice world champion and 16-time Grand Prix winner Stirling Moss, drove the classic Mini Cooper in the fastest time over the route.\n\nFinnish ice speedsters and virtuoso left brakers.\n\nAlso in 1962, BMC sports director Stuart Turner signed two talents from the Nordic forests alongside Irishman Paddy Hopkirk: Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen. The Finnish ice hustlers and virtuoso left-hand brakers shared a love for hard acceleration - and yet couldn't be more different. Mäkinen was not a fan of many words and went down in history as the Flying Finn. Aaltonen speaks five languages fluently ​​and pursued motorsports with scientific meticulousness, which later earned him the title of rally professor.\n\nFrom then on, Mini began to reach for the stars. No matter how hopeless a task seems, Mini has always faced competition throughout its long history. The ingenious basic principle of the vehicle and the three top drivers were important pillars of success. Just like the professional logistics developed by Turner. He set new standards in terms of service organization and was the first team boss to send ice spies to the special stages. John Cooper continued to fine-tune the combustion chamber volume and produced 90 hp in the model now called Mini Cooper S after the displacement expansion to 1071 cc defined for the 1100 class.\n\nBy the way, the Mini Cooper S was visually similar to any everyday Mini. No sporty tailgate, not even a tachometer, instead a thin plastic steering wheel and spartan seats without lateral support. A shelf instead of the dashboard, external body folds and hinges. Thanks to the economical furnishings, a certain amount of space in a tiny car and an extreme economy of space. In short: a bold simplicity.\n\nBehind every success there is hard work.\n\nEven in the 1960s, it wasn't easy to win the Monte Carlo Rally without any prep work. In 1963, Rauno Aaltonen took his first class win at the Monte. And yet the success in the overall ranking in 1964 was a big surprise for the competitors - the competition seemed too overwhelming. 277 cars took part in the 33rd edition of what is probably the most famous rally in the world. The meticulous preparatory work and the weather conditions with plenty of ice and snow benefited the classic Mini. And so overnight the underdog and frightened favorite not only became a crowd favorite, but also a motorsport legend.\n\nIce, snow and 34 hairpin bends over a length of 24 km.\n\nIt was the legendary “Night of the Long Knives”, the penultimate stage of the rally, that brought the Mini Cooper S with starting number #37 and the since famous license plate 33 EJB to victory in the winter of 1964. During the test at the Col de Turini in the French Maritime Alps, 34 hairpin bends have to be mastered over 24 kilometers - a real challenge in snow and ice at a pass altitude of 1,600 meters. Hopkirk reached the finish line just 17 seconds behind his closest rival, Bo Ljungfeldt, in the much more powerful Ford Falcon with a V8 engine. Due to the handicap formula in force at the time to compensate for differences in weight and performance, the classic Mini was in the lead in the overall ranking. And he also defended his lead in the final circuit race through the streets of Monte Carlo.\n\nIn the home country of the classic Mini, the victory was of course celebrated enthusiastically. Hopkirk received a congratulatory telegram from the British government and the Beatles were among the first to congratulate him. “There came an autograph card from the Beatles,” Hopkirk later recalled, which said: “Now you’re one of us, Paddy.” A great memory.” Hopkirk became a motorsport hero overnight and something like the fifth Beatle.\n\nA win can be luck, a winning streak is skill.\n\nThe classic Mini continued to dominate the Monte Carlo Rally in subsequent years. Timo Mäkinen won with a big lead just one year later. The displacement expansion to 1275 cubic centimeters also helped. Mäkinen was the only participant who remained free of penalty points over the entire distance. Despite tons of snow and ice, the organizers had scheduled a second night trip through the Maritime Alps. Mäkinen and his Mini Cooper S were unimpressed and won five of the six special stages on the final stage.\n\nIn 1966 the supposedly ultimate triumph came when the Mini pilots took places one to three. The race management disqualified all three vehicles because of allegedly non-compliant lighting technology - a technology including the characteristic additional headlights in front of the radiator grille, which is still one of the most popular accessories in the brand's range to this day. Even French rally enthusiasts were embarrassed by the disqualification. It only underlined the legendary status of the classic Mini. From now on, Aaltonen, Mäkinen and Hopkirk were considered the “Three Musketeers” – and sales of the classic Mini skyrocketed. In 1967 Aaltonen took overall victory - and yet the end of an era began to emerge. The following year, Vic Elford won in a Porsche 911 - Aaltonen saved the honor of the classic Mini with third place.\n\nIn 1970 it was finally over. The Leyland Group ran into financial difficulties - a magnificent chapter in motorsport history was closed. In July 1971, the last Mini Cooper S rolled off the assembly line.\n\nProven principles and new models.\n\nThe motorsport successes of the early years shaped the brand into the new millennium. And the heritage is carefully maintained and developed further. Front-wheel drive, engines mounted transversely at the front, short body overhangs, agile handling and plenty of space for passengers in a small footprint - elementary characteristics that were transferred from the classic Mini to the new MINI, which has been available since 2001, refined and transformed into the premium segment. New variants such as the MINI Clubman, the MINI Convertible and the MINI Countryman were added - they can all be immediately recognized and experienced as MINI.\n\nOnly a few vehicle concepts have survived a similar time span as the MINI. Hardly any other vehicle has achieved such popularity. None of them has ever been implemented in such a wide variety of variants as the MINI. Driving a MINI was and is not just pure transportation, but also an expression of your own style. The classic of automotive history has become a timeless, cross-generational, and class-spanning vehicle.\n\nMINI surprised everyone again – its successes at the Dakar Rally.\n\nAnd of course, since the takeover by the BMW Group, motorsport and the name John Cooper continue to play an important role. In 2011 and 2012, MINI continued its motorsport history with the John Cooper Works WRC at selected rounds of the FIA ​​World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2012, the MINI ALL4 Racing, designed specifically for marathon rallies, took on a special challenge: the Dakar Rally, the ultimate endurance test for drivers, vehicles and teams. The performance and reliability of the MINI ALL4 Racing led to four consecutive Dakar successes from 2012 to 2015, followed by numbers five and six in 2020 and 2021.\n\nAnd once again the motorsport world had underestimated the little guy who had always achieved such great things.\n\nThe brand name John Cooper Works guarantees outstanding performance not only on the racetrack, but also on the road. John Cooper Works tuning kits for series vehicles were already very popular in the 1970s - they emphasized the most important virtues both visually and technically. A tradition that continues with the new MINI. There are also extreme athletes with the addition of John Cooper Works and an output of up to 225 kW/306 hp.\n\nPrivate motorsport teams continue the tradition.\n\nThe passion for racing still exists and is now lived by private motorsport teams. In 2021, the Bulldog Racing project was created in Nürburg which is dedicated to classic endurance racing. When Bulldog Racing's MINI John Cooper Works made its first appearance at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring in 2022, the John Cooper Works defied all odds for 40 laps and was taken out of the race after an accident. The combative effort thrilled the fans and the red speedster quickly became a crowd favorite.\n\nIn May 2023, in the second 24-hour race, the Bulldog Racing Team achieved a highly acclaimed second place in its class with a MINI John Cooper Works 1to6 Edition at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring. As one of the few vehicles with a manual transmission, the near-production version relied on classic MINI virtues: low weight, a lot of series and even more emotion. In 2024, the Bulldog Racing Team will be racing in the “Green Hell” again with a MINI John Cooper Works racecar.\n\nOn the way to becoming a purely electrically powered brand.\n\nThe future of the MINI feeling is almost silent, locally emission-free, but extremely powerful. The MINI Cooper and the the MINI Countryman have been showed already, while the new MINI Aceman, a completely new vehicle that sits between these two models, will follow in the first half of 2024. And the MINI John Cooper Works models are also being gradually electrified - a new chapter in the brand's more than 60-year history.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: The vehicle shown is not a series development car that is not available for sale."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Their motto was: Anyone who doesn't believe in miracles is not a realist.

Give it more power, improve the brakes and build the thing.” The underestimated underdog – a role that MINI has been happy to take on again and again in its more than six decade history – was born.\n\n64 years of the brand, 62 years of motorsport.\n\nThe first Mini Cooper was created in 1960 - with an impressive 55 horsepower instead of the 34 horsepower of the original Mini from 1959. As early as 1961, the Mini Cooper, which was just three meters long, turned the world of high-speed drivers upside down. From now on, even the less well-off could tile across the country at least as quickly as the owners of pure sports cars and high-horsepower limousines. And on the rally trails and racing tracks, the little racers with their almost delicate ten-inch wheels won the trophies.\n\nThe classic Mini Cooper was tailor-made for the rally routes of the time. Hardly any body overhangs ensured a previously unknown neutral driving behavior.\n\nAnd thanks to the rather modest 650 kilos that a Rallye Mini weighed at the time, the power-to-weight ratio was quite acceptable with the modest 55 hp. This construction was to become the origin of the famous go-kart feeling.\n\nIn May 1962, the classic Mini entered the winners' list of an international rally event for the first time. At the International Tulip Rally, which led from the Dutch municipality of Noordwijk to the French Riviera and back again, Pat Moss, sister of the four-time vice world champion and 16-time Grand Prix winner Stirling Moss, drove the classic Mini Cooper in the fastest time over the route.\n\nFinnish ice speedsters and virtuoso left brakers.\n\nAlso in 1962, BMC sports director Stuart Turner signed two talents from the Nordic forests alongside Irishman Paddy Hopkirk: Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen. The Finnish ice hustlers and virtuoso left-hand brakers shared a love for hard acceleration - and yet couldn't be more different. Mäkinen was not a fan of many words and went down in history as the Flying Finn. Aaltonen speaks five languages fluently ​​and pursued motorsports with scientific meticulousness, which later earned him the title of rally professor.\n\nFrom then on, Mini began to reach for the stars. No matter how hopeless a task seems, Mini has always faced competition throughout its long history. The ingenious basic principle of the vehicle and the three top drivers were important pillars of success. Just like the professional logistics developed by Turner. He set new standards in terms of service organization and was the first team boss to send ice spies to the special stages. John Cooper continued to fine-tune the combustion chamber volume and produced 90 hp in the model now called Mini Cooper S after the displacement expansion to 1071 cc defined for the 1100 class.\n\nBy the way, the Mini Cooper S was visually similar to any everyday Mini. No sporty tailgate, not even a tachometer, instead a thin plastic steering wheel and spartan seats without lateral support. A shelf instead of the dashboard, external body folds and hinges. Thanks to the economical furnishings, a certain amount of space in a tiny car and an extreme economy of space. In short: a bold simplicity.\n\nBehind every success there is hard work.\n\nEven in the 1960s, it wasn't easy to win the Monte Carlo Rally without any prep work. In 1963, Rauno Aaltonen took his first class win at the Monte. And yet the success in the overall ranking in 1964 was a big surprise for the competitors - the competition seemed too overwhelming. 277 cars took part in the 33rd edition of what is probably the most famous rally in the world. The meticulous preparatory work and the weather conditions with plenty of ice and snow benefited the classic Mini. And so overnight the underdog and frightened favorite not only became a crowd favorite, but also a motorsport legend.\n\nIce, snow and 34 hairpin bends over a length of 24 km.\n\nIt was the legendary “Night of the Long Knives”, the penultimate stage of the rally, that brought the Mini Cooper S with starting number #37 and the since famous license plate 33 EJB to victory in the winter of 1964. During the test at the Col de Turini in the French Maritime Alps, 34 hairpin bends have to be mastered over 24 kilometers - a real challenge in snow and ice at a pass altitude of 1,600 meters. Hopkirk reached the finish line just 17 seconds behind his closest rival, Bo Ljungfeldt, in the much more powerful Ford Falcon with a V8 engine. Due to the handicap formula in force at the time to compensate for differences in weight and performance, the classic Mini was in the lead in the overall ranking. And he also defended his lead in the final circuit race through the streets of Monte Carlo.\n\nIn the home country of the classic Mini, the victory was of course celebrated enthusiastically. Hopkirk received a congratulatory telegram from the British government and the Beatles were among the first to congratulate him. “There came an autograph card from the Beatles,” Hopkirk later recalled, which said: “Now you’re one of us, Paddy.” A great memory.” Hopkirk became a motorsport hero overnight and something like the fifth Beatle.\n\nA win can be luck, a winning streak is skill.\n\nThe classic Mini continued to dominate the Monte Carlo Rally in subsequent years. Timo Mäkinen won with a big lead just one year later. The displacement expansion to 1275 cubic centimeters also helped. Mäkinen was the only participant who remained free of penalty points over the entire distance. Despite tons of snow and ice, the organizers had scheduled a second night trip through the Maritime Alps. Mäkinen and his Mini Cooper S were unimpressed and won five of the six special stages on the final stage.\n\nIn 1966 the supposedly ultimate triumph came when the Mini pilots took places one to three. The race management disqualified all three vehicles because of allegedly non-compliant lighting technology - a technology including the characteristic additional headlights in front of the radiator grille, which is still one of the most popular accessories in the brand's range to this day. Even French rally enthusiasts were embarrassed by the disqualification. It only underlined the legendary status of the classic Mini. From now on, Aaltonen, Mäkinen and Hopkirk were considered the “Three Musketeers” – and sales of the classic Mini skyrocketed. In 1967 Aaltonen took overall victory - and yet the end of an era began to emerge. The following year, Vic Elford won in a Porsche 911 - Aaltonen saved the honor of the classic Mini with third place.\n\nIn 1970 it was finally over. The Leyland Group ran into financial difficulties - a magnificent chapter in motorsport history was closed. In July 1971, the last Mini Cooper S rolled off the assembly line.\n\nProven principles and new models.\n\nThe motorsport successes of the early years shaped the brand into the new millennium. And the heritage is carefully maintained and developed further. Front-wheel drive, engines mounted transversely at the front, short body overhangs, agile handling and plenty of space for passengers in a small footprint - elementary characteristics that were transferred from the classic Mini to the new MINI, which has been available since 2001, refined and transformed into the premium segment. New variants such as the MINI Clubman, the MINI Convertible and the MINI Countryman were added - they can all be immediately recognized and experienced as MINI.\n\nOnly a few vehicle concepts have survived a similar time span as the MINI. Hardly any other vehicle has achieved such popularity. None of them has ever been implemented in such a wide variety of variants as the MINI. Driving a MINI was and is not just pure transportation, but also an expression of your own style. The classic of automotive history has become a timeless, cross-generational, and class-spanning vehicle.\n\nMINI surprised everyone again – its successes at the Dakar Rally.\n\nAnd of course, since the takeover by the BMW Group, motorsport and the name John Cooper continue to play an important role. In 2011 and 2012, MINI continued its motorsport history with the John Cooper Works WRC at selected rounds of the FIA ​​World Rally Championship (WRC). From 2012, the MINI ALL4 Racing, designed specifically for marathon rallies, took on a special challenge: the Dakar Rally, the ultimate endurance test for drivers, vehicles and teams. The performance and reliability of the MINI ALL4 Racing led to four consecutive Dakar successes from 2012 to 2015, followed by numbers five and six in 2020 and 2021.\n\nAnd once again the motorsport world had underestimated the little guy who had always achieved such great things.\n\nThe brand name John Cooper Works guarantees outstanding performance not only on the racetrack, but also on the road. John Cooper Works tuning kits for series vehicles were already very popular in the 1970s - they emphasized the most important virtues both visually and technically. A tradition that continues with the new MINI. There are also extreme athletes with the addition of John Cooper Works and an output of up to 225 kW/306 hp.\n\nPrivate motorsport teams continue the tradition.\n\nThe passion for racing still exists and is now lived by private motorsport teams. In 2021, the Bulldog Racing project was created in Nürburg which is dedicated to classic endurance racing. When Bulldog Racing's MINI John Cooper Works made its first appearance at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring in 2022, the John Cooper Works defied all odds for 40 laps and was taken out of the race after an accident. The combative effort thrilled the fans and the red speedster quickly became a crowd favorite.\n\nIn May 2023, in the second 24-hour race, the Bulldog Racing Team achieved a highly acclaimed second place in its class with a MINI John Cooper Works 1to6 Edition at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring. As one of the few vehicles with a manual transmission, the near-production version relied on classic MINI virtues: low weight, a lot of series and even more emotion. In 2024, the Bulldog Racing Team will be racing in the “Green Hell” again with a MINI John Cooper Works racecar.\n\nOn the way to becoming a purely electrically powered brand.\n\nThe future of the MINI feeling is almost silent, locally emission-free, but extremely powerful. The MINI Cooper and the the MINI Countryman have been showed already, while the new MINI Aceman, a completely new vehicle that sits between these two models, will follow in the first half of 2024. And the MINI John Cooper Works models are also being gradually electrified - a new chapter in the brand's more than 60-year history.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: The vehicle shown is not a series development car that is not available for sale."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "MINI"}]}

Paddy Hopkirk made the British small car a motorsport legend with his overall victory in the Monte Carlo Rally 60 years ago - Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen repeated the triumph in 1965 and 1967. Successes that shook up the sports establishment and changed and shaped the MINI brand until today.Munich/Monte Carlo. These days marks the 60th anniversary of one of the most spectacular successes in the history of international motorsport. With Irishman Patrick “Paddy” Hopkirk at the wheel, the Mini Cooper S won the overall standings of the Monte Carlo Rally. Happiness? Coincidence? A quirk of fate? Probably not, because two more victories followed at the Monte Carlo Rally and numerous other successes until the end of the 1960s. Looking back, the reasons for this were: modern technology, top drivers and new logistics standards.\n\n\"Paddy Hopkirk's victory in the Mini Cooper S in 1964 marked a turning point in the history of Mini. It proved that the classic Mini was not only a charming city car, but also a successful car in motorsport. This tradition and passion for racing is in our legacy and can still be felt in our models today. Motorsport has shaped Mini and will always remain an important part of our DNA,\" says Stefanie Wurst, Head of MINI.\n\nBlueprint for modern small cars.\n\nAt the end of the 1950s, the rally greats mostly moved in stately and lavishly motorized vehicles through English forests, over French passes or from Liège to Sofia and back again. Austin Healey and Ford Falcon were the benchmark at the rallies and dominated the scene. They weren't really suitable for everyday use. During this time, Alec Issigonis, on behalf of the British Motor Corporation (BMC), built the the most modern car of its time: with its transverse engine and front-wheel drive, the classic Mini met the standard for small cars that is still valid today when it debuted in 1959.\n\nAn impressive sports career required a second brilliant car guy: John Cooper. He had achieved fame as a racing driver and wealth as a designer - and he was immediately convinced of the sporting potential of the classic Mini. Cooper, who in his Formula 1 cars did not place the engine in front of the driver, as was usual at the time, but behind him, summed it up to his friend Issigonis, who saw the classic Mini as more of a car for everyone: “That's a damn race car.

In qualifying today things looked pretty good until the red flag came out.

We didn’t focus on outright pace in all practice sessions we had. It was much more about making the car behave predictably and be driveable for us. That’s key in an endurance race like this – especially with a new car. It’s most important that reliability and operations are good. If you tick these two boxes, then you’ve already made it quite far.”\n\nNick Yelloly (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, 8th place): “Since I wasn’t able to go out on track during warm-up, I didn’t get a read of the strong wind that changed significantly from yesterday where we had a decent balance in the car. Even if qualifying wasn’t the ideal session for us, we still learned something – like we did in every session here at the Roar.

Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Group’s mission with its new high-performance test vehicle – the #BMW Vision Driving Experience. This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse – the next generation of BMW vehicles – and referred to by BMW as the #Heart of Joy. The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension – BMW’s hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure – to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.\n\n“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”\n\nThe Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.\n\nEnergy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range. By contrast, conventional systems have separate control algorithms for the drive system and brakes. This means the full handling potential of vehicles with powerful electric drive systems cannot be fully exploited.\n\nThe driver and passengers here experience a harmonious and noiseless driving feeling – regardless of the situation and speed they are travelling at. In dynamic driving scenarios, the new Heart of Joy / BMW Dynamic Performance Control combination serves up cornering poise and assurance beyond compare. The car generates impressive traction and can be threaded through corners with exceptional precision. Fewer control inputs are required and the car’s line can be maintained with greater precision and stability. This helps the car to develop consistent, reproducible cornering behaviour and allows it to be steered more intuitively and smoothly. At low speeds – such as in stop-start driving or when parking – direct signal transmissions and rapid information processing ensure an even more compelling driving experience. In driving modes D or B, or when using Active Cruise Control, the parking brake or parking lock, stopping and restarting merge seamlessly into one another.\n\nFurthermore, integrated drivetrain, braking and energy recuperation control allows energy to be used more sustainably. 98 per cent of drivers do not need to make any inputs using the conventional brakes. The braking power generated using energy recuperation is sufficient for normal, everyday driving. Only under heavy braking, e.g. in an emergency situation, is intervention required from the friction brakes. All in all, this system increases efficiency by up to 25 per cent.\n\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience test vehicle demonstrates how the Heart of Joy works using illuminating colour codes on the wheel rims: acceleration is indicated in green, energy recuperation in blue and braking using the friction brakes in orange.\n\nFour totally new super-brains will go to work in the BMW of the future. These high-performance computers cleverly combine various elements that previously ran separately. The Heart of Joy was developed 100 percent within the company. It allows four important control units to be brought together within a single high-performance computer.\n\nAnother three super-brains are responsible for features including automated and highly automated driving, infotainment and basic functions such as climate control and comfort-enhancing systems, vehicle access, interior and exterior lighting.\n\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience will celebrate its official world premiere at #Auto Shanghai 2025."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Top-class dynamics, precision, efficiency and driving pleasure +++ New “Heart of Joy” central computer works ten times faster +++ Extending the recuperation range increases efficiency by 25% +++"}]}

Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Group’s mission with its new high-performance test vehicle – the #BMW Vision Driving Experience. This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse – the next generation of BMW vehicles – and referred to by BMW as the #Heart of Joy. The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension – BMW’s hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure – to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.\n\n“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”\n\nThe Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.\n\nEnergy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range. By contrast, conventional systems have separate control algorithms for the drive system and brakes. This means the full handling potential of vehicles with powerful electric drive systems cannot be fully exploited.\n\nThe driver and passengers here experience a harmonious and noiseless driving feeling – regardless of the situation and speed they are travelling at. In dynamic driving scenarios, the new Heart of Joy / BMW Dynamic Performance Control combination serves up cornering poise and assurance beyond compare. The car generates impressive traction and can be threaded through corners with exceptional precision. Fewer control inputs are required and the car’s line can be maintained with greater precision and stability. This helps the car to develop consistent, reproducible cornering behaviour and allows it to be steered more intuitively and smoothly. At low speeds – such as in stop-start driving or when parking – direct signal transmissions and rapid information processing ensure an even more compelling driving experience. In driving modes D or B, or when using Active Cruise Control, the parking brake or parking lock, stopping and restarting merge seamlessly into one another.\n\nFurthermore, integrated drivetrain, braking and energy recuperation control allows energy to be used more sustainably. 98 per cent of drivers do not need to make any inputs using the conventional brakes. The braking power generated using energy recuperation is sufficient for normal, everyday driving. Only under heavy braking, e.g. in an emergency situation, is intervention required from the friction brakes. All in all, this system increases efficiency by up to 25 per cent.\n\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience test vehicle demonstrates how the Heart of Joy works using illuminating colour codes on the wheel rims: acceleration is indicated in green, energy recuperation in blue and braking using the friction brakes in orange.\n\nFour totally new super-brains will go to work in the BMW of the future.

BMW Group Plant Araquari in Santa Catarina, Brazil, is celebrating its 10th anniversary, having produced more than 100,000 vehicles. BMW Group’s local plants serving as the perfect complement to the company's full plants in Europe, the Americas and China and allowing the BMW Group to tap into new markets through localised production. Local prodution has a long tradition at the BMW Group, enabling markets to offer a wide range of regionally manufactured vehicles at competitive prices.\n\nWhat began in 1957 with production of the BMW Isetta in the UK, now comprises seven locations across Asia, North Africa and South America. The principle behind this approach is that production follows the market. The BMW Group Plants Rosslyn in South Africa and Shenyang in China have thus developed from local production into full-scale plants.\n\nFor the past 10 years, the site in Araquari has been fully integrated into the production network, supplying the Brazilian market. By covering all essential areas of production, except for having its own press shop, the plant can manufacture a wide range of vehicle models and drive train variants.\n\nThe plant in Brazil follows the principle of flexible production and manufactures various models on one production line. In addition to petrol and hybrid drive trains, flex-fuel models are also built in Brazil.\n\nThe BMW 3 Series and BMW X1 models produced in Araquari are the top-selling vehicles in their segments in Brazil, securing the brand's leading position in the premium segment for the sixth consecutive year in 2023. The plant currently also builds the BMW X3 and BMW X4, with the BMW X5 PHEV set to join them in a few weeks – thus becoming the next plant in the production network to manufacture electrified vehicles.\n\nBMW Group expenditure in Brazil bears fruit.\n\nThe local sites in the prodiction network contribute significantly more than just manufacturing vehicles, with Brazil serving as a prime example of this: Since 2014, the BMW Group has expended more than BRL 1.8 billion in the location, focusing on production, as well as on research and development facilities. Between 2025 and 2028, the BMW Group will expend a further BRL 1.1 billion in the country. “Brazil offers potential for local production of other new models and for development of new technologies,” says Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production. “Every BMW and MINI we sell worldwide already incorporates developments from Brazil – and we intend to build on this success.” Thus, the success story of BMW Group’s local production continues – both in Brazil and around the world.\n\nHigh flexibility as key to success.\n\nMore than a dozen models can be manufactured on the same line at the local plants worldwide.

Second win of the season, 30th victory of his DTM career: René Rast (GER) had a fantastic Sunday at the fifth race weekend of the season at the Nürburgring (GER). Driving the #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, he stormed from sixth on the grid to the top, earning valuable points to rejoin the title race. Marco Wittmann (GER) already impressed on Saturday with a strong comeback drive, finishing fifth in the #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO. On Sunday, he started from seventh and finished second, completing the double victory for Schubert Motorsport.\n\nAfter a disappointing 14th place on Saturday, Rast seemed to be losing touch in the drivers’ standings. He had actually delivered a spectacular comeback drive from 17th on the grid to seventh, but a post-race time penalty following a collision on the first lap dropped him back. Thanks to his commanding victory on Sunday, Rast is now back in the title fight, sitting fourth in the overall standings with 117 points, just 20 points behind the leader. The 38-year-old took the lead from sixth on the grid during the first stint and steadily extended it on fresh tyres in the second stint.\n\nWittmann shone in both races. On Saturday, he climbed nine positions, finishing fifth after starting 14th. On Sunday, a perfect strategy and strong pit stops by the Schubert team secured him a podium finish. It was his second podium of the season, and he now sits seventh in the drivers’ standings with 101 points. Schubert Motorsport holds second place in the team standings with 213 points.\n\nADAC GT4 Germany: Victory and two podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. BMW M Motorsport teams also celebrated podium finishes at the Nürburgring weekend in the ADAC GT4 Germany. On Sunday, Gabriele Piana (ITA) and BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler (TUR) secured the first win of the season for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO and the FK Performance Motorsport team. The duo claimed a commanding victory from second on the grid. On Saturday, Piana and Besler finished fourth – directly behind two other BMW M4 GT4 EVOs. Thomas Rackl and Linus Hahne (both GER), along with Tim Reiter and Phillip Wiskirchen (both GER), completed a double podium for Team ME Motorsport by finishing second and third. Rackl and Hahne confirmed their strong form with a fourth-place finish on Sunday.\n\nStatements after the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “A fantastic weekend at the Nürburgring is behind our BMW M Motorsport teams. Schubert Motorsport shone on Sunday with their second one-two finish of the season after Zandvoort, re-entering the title fight in both the drivers’ and team standings after a challenging Saturday race. Equally impressive are the results in the ADAC GT4 Germany. I am absolutely thrilled about the victory for Gabriele Piana and our BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler on Sunday – marking the first win of the season for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO in this series. Alongside FK Performance Motorsport, ME Motorsport also had reason to celebrate on the podium. Getting both cars onto the podium on Saturday was an outstanding achievement. Congratulations and a big thank you to everyone involved!”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “It was a weekend of highs and lows. Of course, we are absolutely thrilled about the one-two victory on Sunday, but unfortunately, on Saturday, we didn’t have the performance we needed and left important points on the table. On Sunday, both drivers were very happy with the cars and were able to work their way from strong starting positions all the way to the top. Looking at the championship, we scored a lot of points here, but we now need to keep fighting. The Sachsenring is coming up next, and it’s a track where we’ve struggled in the past.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 14th place, R2: 1st place): “The victory on Sunday is a fantastic way to wrap up the Nürburgring weekend. I already noticed during the formation lap that my BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt fantastic on the track and had incredible grip. As a result, I was able to attack right from the start of the race and secure a surprisingly commanding victory. I had hoped for a podium, but I didn’t expect the win. Unfortunately, we left some points on the table on Saturday, but thanks to Sunday’s results, I’m back in the title fight. Now it’s on to the Sachsenring, where we’ve traditionally faced some challenges. The goal there will be to maximise the points we can take.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 5th place, R2: 2nd place): “It was a very good weekend, and I’m really happy. Finishing fifth on Saturday from 14th on the grid was already an incredible comeback. Then to top it off today with second place after starting from seventh is fantastic. The team did an outstanding job with the strategy and pit stops, which were the keys to this success.

On Sunday, he started from seventh and finished second, completing the double victory for Schubert Motorsport.\n\nAfter a disappointing 14th place on Saturday, Rast seemed to be losing touch in the drivers’ standings. He had actually delivered a spectacular comeback drive from 17th on the grid to seventh, but a post-race time penalty following a collision on the first lap dropped him back. Thanks to his commanding victory on Sunday, Rast is now back in the title fight, sitting fourth in the overall standings with 117 points, just 20 points behind the leader. The 38-year-old took the lead from sixth on the grid during the first stint and steadily extended it on fresh tyres in the second stint.\n\nWittmann shone in both races. On Saturday, he climbed nine positions, finishing fifth after starting 14th. On Sunday, a perfect strategy and strong pit stops by the Schubert team secured him a podium finish. It was his second podium of the season, and he now sits seventh in the drivers’ standings with 101 points. Schubert Motorsport holds second place in the team standings with 213 points.\n\nADAC GT4 Germany: Victory and two podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. BMW M Motorsport teams also celebrated podium finishes at the Nürburgring weekend in the ADAC GT4 Germany. On Sunday, Gabriele Piana (ITA) and BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler (TUR) secured the first win of the season for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO and the FK Performance Motorsport team. The duo claimed a commanding victory from second on the grid. On Saturday, Piana and Besler finished fourth – directly behind two other BMW M4 GT4 EVOs. Thomas Rackl and Linus Hahne (both GER), along with Tim Reiter and Phillip Wiskirchen (both GER), completed a double podium for Team ME Motorsport by finishing second and third. Rackl and Hahne confirmed their strong form with a fourth-place finish on Sunday.\n\nStatements after the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “A fantastic weekend at the Nürburgring is behind our BMW M Motorsport teams. Schubert Motorsport shone on Sunday with their second one-two finish of the season after Zandvoort, re-entering the title fight in both the drivers’ and team standings after a challenging Saturday race. Equally impressive are the results in the ADAC GT4 Germany. I am absolutely thrilled about the victory for Gabriele Piana and our BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler on Sunday – marking the first win of the season for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO in this series. Alongside FK Performance Motorsport, ME Motorsport also had reason to celebrate on the podium. Getting both cars onto the podium on Saturday was an outstanding achievement. Congratulations and a big thank you to everyone involved!”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “It was a weekend of highs and lows. Of course, we are absolutely thrilled about the one-two victory on Sunday, but unfortunately, on Saturday, we didn’t have the performance we needed and left important points on the table. On Sunday, both drivers were very happy with the cars and were able to work their way from strong starting positions all the way to the top. Looking at the championship, we scored a lot of points here, but we now need to keep fighting. The Sachsenring is coming up next, and it’s a track where we’ve struggled in the past.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 14th place, R2: 1st place): “The victory on Sunday is a fantastic way to wrap up the Nürburgring weekend. I already noticed during the formation lap that my BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt fantastic on the track and had incredible grip. As a result, I was able to attack right from the start of the race and secure a surprisingly commanding victory. I had hoped for a podium, but I didn’t expect the win. Unfortunately, we left some points on the table on Saturday, but thanks to Sunday’s results, I’m back in the title fight. Now it’s on to the Sachsenring, where we’ve traditionally faced some challenges. The goal there will be to maximise the points we can take.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 5th place, R2: 2nd place): “It was a very good weekend, and I’m really happy. Finishing fifth on Saturday from 14th on the grid was already an incredible comeback. Then to top it off today with second place after starting from seventh is fantastic. The team did an outstanding job with the strategy and pit stops, which were the keys to this success. Especially after the zero points at my home event at the Norisring, this weekend comes as a real relief.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

At the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA), BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team experienced just how tough and dramatic endurance racing can be. At the 2025 season finale of the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), the team was only 28 minutes away from securing what would have been BMW’s historic first title in the series. Running second in the race, Markus Reiterberger (GER), Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), and Steven Odendaal (RSA) were on course for the world championship crown with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. But after 23.5 of the 24 hours, a technical issue forced the bike into the pits and out of the race. That left the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team third in the final championship standings. Celebration came, however, from the Superstock Champion-MRP-Tecmas squad who rode the #9 BMW M 1000 RR to the overall podium and victory in the SST class.\n\nThe final 24-hour race could hardly have been more thrilling. Starting from second place on the grid, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team went into the marathon tied on points with YART (Yamaha). After the first set of world championship points was awarded at the eight-hour mark, the BMW factory team moved into the lead and kept it with more points after 16 hours. The #37 machine remained on course for the title until less than half an hour from the checkered flag when retirement struck.\n\nIn the Superstock class, just as at the 8 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), Champion-MRP-Tecmas competed with the #9 BMW M 1000 RR. Just like in Belgium, the team celebrated a class victory – and crowned that with third overall, the first Superstock team to claim an overall podium since 2021. Riders Loris Cresson (FRA), Bálint Kovacs (HUN), Jan-Ole Jähnig (GER), and Hannes Soomer (EST) shared riding duties. The team also secured third place in the FIM Endurance World Cup standings for Superstock bikes.\n\nThe Japanese AutoRace Ube Racing Team made its Bol d’Or debut with the #76 BMW M 1000 RR. Naomichi Uramoto (JPN), Loris Baz (FRA), and Leandro Mercado (ARG) were running a strong fourth place until late in the race when they too had to retire due to a technical issue.\n\nReactions after the season finale at Le Castellet:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Of course, it is very bitter when a possible world championship title slips away so shortly before the finish. Just 28 minutes separated us from this historic success. But that is endurance racing: nothing is decided until the checkered flag falls. The riders and the team gave everything to keep the dream alive, but fate had other plans. Congratulations to YART on winning the title. Once the initial disappointment fades, we can be proud of what the team achieved this season. Everyone delivered outstanding performances in all four races. My thanks go to everyone in the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, to Team Manager Werner Daemen and our riders, as well as all the colleagues in Munich and Berlin who worked so hard for this dream. Next year we want to make it a reality – that’s a promise! The performance of the AutoRace Ube Racing Team was also impressive; in their Bol d’Or debut they held fourth place for a long time. Congratulations to the Champion-MRP-Tecmas Team. Third place overall and victory in the Superstock class is an outstanding achievement and once again highlights the strength of the BMW M 1000 RR in all its specifications.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “My summary of the Bol d’Or: first and foremost, it was an incredible motorsport festival. We’ll be back! What clearly prevails is the joy of seeing the potential of the bike and the team, and of experiencing the tremendous support from everyone – from headquarters in Munich and Berlin, from the race team, all partners, suppliers, and sponsors here on site. Twenty-four hours is always a challenge with maximum performance and concentration under all conditions. The way the team demonstrated this was exemplary – each and every one here, with the riders leading the way. Therefore, my thanks go to all involved. We can only apologise for the technical failure. But BMW will be back, and together we will fight for the world championship next year. And I am very pleased that – despite all the bad luck with the #37 – the #9 BMW M 1000 RR claimed a convincing victory in the Stock class and reached the overall podium.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I have no words to explain my feelings. I am really, really disappointed. And I think this is normal if you fight like me 20 years for this and then such things happen. It breaks my heart, especially for the team. But next year we will do it better. Next year we go for the world championship!”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “Well, basically everything fell under control and we managed everything really well, the engine and the pace for the second part of the race. So it was there for us to take. We did everything right to go and get the second place in the race and most importantly to get the World Championship. But it wasn’t to be. But it’s endurance. Endurance is sometimes cruel. It was an extremely tough race. I think we all gave a lot. And we all feel now like we’re going home empty-handed. But like I said, it’s what it is. Now we have a bit of time, we’ll reflect, take the good bits and come back stronger.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “We managed to be fighting for the title in the final race. We did everything we could to make it happen. We were well on our way, matched on points with YART in qualifying, and by the eight-hour mark of the race we had already built up a points lead. That put us first in the world championship standings. We were then leading the standings. Second place in the race would have been enough for us to secure the title. We just wanted to bring it home – and then, so close to the end, the unthinkable happened. And yes, it just feels like a bad dream. I don’t think you can have worse luck than that. Honestly, I don’t even know what to say. But I am grateful to the whole team and everyone involved, because everyone gave their maximum. No one deserved an outcome like this. Above all, it was hard to stand on the podium afterwards. I think it will take some time before one can really come to terms with something like this.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The team did a really good job. We all gave our 100%. Being tied with the championship lead after qualifying was a great way to start the last race of the year. But unfortunately life sometimes doesn’t work out the way you want it and it’s not the end of the world. We gave it our best shot and unfortunately we had a mechanical failure. But this is racing and there’s always another year, another time, another championship. So I just wanted to say thanks to the team for the great effort that they put in and hopefully we can try and do something in the future.”\n\nFinal World Championship standings (R04/04).\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nYou can find all result from the Bol d’Or at the following link: ITS-Results.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Just 28 minutes separate BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team from a potential world championship title. +++ BMW factory team finishes the season third in the championship standings. +++ Champion-MRP-Tecmas takes the BMW M 1000 RR to the overall podium and victory in the Superstock class. +++"}]}

Next year we go for the world championship!”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “Well, basically everything fell under control and we managed everything really well, the engine and the pace for the second part of the race. So it was there for us to take. We did everything right to go and get the second place in the race and most importantly to get the World Championship. But it wasn’t to be. But it’s endurance. Endurance is sometimes cruel. It was an extremely tough race. I think we all gave a lot. And we all feel now like we’re going home empty-handed. But like I said, it’s what it is. Now we have a bit of time, we’ll reflect, take the good bits and come back stronger.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “We managed to be fighting for the title in the final race. We did everything we could to make it happen. We were well on our way, matched on points with YART in qualifying, and by the eight-hour mark of the race we had already built up a points lead. That put us first in the world championship standings. We were then leading the standings. Second place in the race would have been enough for us to secure the title. We just wanted to bring it home – and then, so close to the end, the unthinkable happened. And yes, it just feels like a bad dream. I don’t think you can have worse luck than that. Honestly, I don’t even know what to say. But I am grateful to the whole team and everyone involved, because everyone gave their maximum. No one deserved an outcome like this. Above all, it was hard to stand on the podium afterwards. I think it will take some time before one can really come to terms with something like this.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The team did a really good job. We all gave our 100%. Being tied with the championship lead after qualifying was a great way to start the last race of the year. But unfortunately life sometimes doesn’t work out the way you want it and it’s not the end of the world. We gave it our best shot and unfortunately we had a mechanical failure. But this is racing and there’s always another year, another time, another championship. So I just wanted to say thanks to the team for the great effort that they put in and hopefully we can try and do something in the future.”\n\nFinal World Championship standings (R04/04).\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nYou can find all result from the Bol d’Or at the following link: ITS-Results.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

From September 4 to 7, Frieze Seoul will open its doors at COEX in Gangnam for the third edition of the internationally renowned art fair in Asia. As one of Frieze’s long-term global partners since 2004, BMW will be celebrating two special premieres at this year's fair: The BMW Art Car #20 by Julie Mehretu makes its Asian debut after being unveiled in Paris in May. Inspired by the BMW Art Car Collection and curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, BMW also presents the world premiere of a limited BMW i7 miniature edition created by artists Heemin Chung and Alvaro Barrington. A major highlight of this year's programme is the second edition of Frieze Music Seoul on September 5, presented in collaboration with BMW and featuring a live performance by Korean singer-songwriter SAAY. BMW will be providing the VIP car service for the third consecutive year, from the inception of Frieze Seoul.\n\nOn the occasion of Frieze Seoul, the 20th BMW Art Car by American artist Julie Mehretu will be on display for the first time outside Europe at this year's fair. Fresh from its world premiere at the Centre Pompidou and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, it is the latest addition to the legendary BMW Art Car Collection, continuing an almost 50-year tradition. Since 1975, artists such as Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, Cao Fei, and John Baldessari have turned BMW race and series cars into works of art.\n\nSpace, movement and energy have always been central motifs in Julie Mehretu's work. For the design of the 20th BMW Art Car, she transformed a two-dimensional image into a three-dimensional representation for the first time, with which she succeeded in bringing dynamism into form. Julie Mehretu used the colour and form vocabulary of her monumental painting “Everywhen” (2021 - 2023) as a starting point for her design. The work is currently on view at the artist’s major retrospective at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice and will subsequently become part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, to which it has been gifted. The collaboration between BMW and Julie Mehretu continues beyond the car itself for the first time in the history of the BMW Art Car collection. It includes a joint commitment to a series of PanAfrican Translocal Media Workshops for filmmakers, which will tour various African cities in 2025 and 2026, and will culminate in a major exhibition at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town.\n\nInspired by the BMW Art Car Collection, BMW will present a limited BMW i7 miniature edition created by Korean artist Heemin Chung and London based artist Alvaro Barrington, that are exclusively for sale at Frieze Seoul. Both artists were selected by curator and member of the BMW Art Car Jury, Hans Ulrich Obrist. The two artists worked on their design using different artistic approaches to encapsulate the essence of human-centered design and technological innovation, exploring the future of mobility. They created the miniatures in reaction to experiencing the BMW i7, and as a reference to the model name of the vehicle, they designed 7 miniatures each. The profit from the sale of the miniatures will be donated to a charity of the artists’ choice.\n\nHeemin Chung investigates the material potential of digital images as she translates them into the mediums of painting and sculpture. Her work interrogates the role of technology in society and how it has shaped contemporary approaches to art.\n\nChung worked on her project with the early stages of electric motor development in mind, where experiments in mobility were conducted by imitating nature. She mentions ornithopters, which were designed by studying the forms and movements of birds, bats, and insects. The traces of these experiments are still palpable today in various modern electric motor-powered aircraft. Inspired by the organic curves of the i7, Heemin Chung aimed to make the body appear like a living organism, as if something might emerge at any moment. Chung commented on the connection of her work to the keyword \"tech magic\" used by BMW to describe the feeling of encountering technological features: “It brought to mind the different forms of magic that have existed throughout history, each contributing not only to humanity but also to the survival and flourishing of life on Earth. Although the ornithopter is remembered as a failed experiment, today's technology has made the dream of emulating nature a reality, continuing to spark new imaginations about power and propulsion.”\n\nAlvaro Barrington’s practice explores interconnected histories of cultural production. Considering himself primarily a painter, Barrington’s multimedia approach to image-making employs burlap, textiles, postcards and clothing, exploring how materials themselves can function as visual tools while referencing their personal, political and commercial histories.\n\nBarrington is interested in how the vehicles of the future will have the potential to recognise our moods, emotions and schedules, and as such adapt to them accordingly. The artist explores the future of cars reimagined as self-driving entertainment units and places for meeting that can help bridge different cultures through new technologies such as instant language translation. Utilising artificial intelligence, cars will go far beyond their purely transporting function and instead help us foster new connections and fulfil our daily needs.\n\nFor this project, Barrington looked into video games centered around cars, which were not only important as play and entertainment, but also as platforms for music and culture. Exploring the history of cars and other vehicles that enable travel and movement, the artist has focused on the intersection of cars and culture and the way they have influenced one another. Merging these references, the artist created 7 unique cars, each featuring a drawing from a film, music video or portraying a cultural figure, which remain influential in Barrington's life and practice.\n\nFrieze MusicIn celebration of their long-term collaboration, BMW and Frieze will partner again to present Frieze Music in Seoul. On September 5th, after a successful tour in the United States and release of her hit single ‘Domino’, SAAY will be performing at the Shilla for Frieze Music. Exploring the intersection of music and the arts to spark inspiring dialogues, Frieze Music provides artists the opportunity to create a unique performance, highlighting their craft through song, inspiration and conversations with fellow artists. Launched during the inaugural Frieze Los Angeles in 2019, the joint initiative between BMW and Frieze has brought together a wide range of musicians including Moses Sumney, Caroline Polachek, Nilüfer Yanya or Loyle Carner.\n\nTo visit the BMW Lounge please note that entrance tickets are required:\n\nBMW Art Car #20 by Julie Mehretu and limited BMW i7 miniature edition by Heemin Chung and Alvaro BarringtonSeptember 4-7BMW Lounge, Hall CCOEX, 513 Yeongdong-daero,Gangnam-gu\n\nPrivate ViewWednesday, September 4: 2.15pmFollowed by a Champagne Toast Media Accreditation and interview requests (limited capacity)\n\nArtist Talk with Heemin Chung, Alvaro Barrington and curator Hans Ulrich ObristThursday, September 5: 3pm Media Accreditation (limited capacity)\n\nOpening HoursWednesday, September 4: 11am to 7pm (invitation only)Thursday, September 5: 11am to 7pm (invitation and preview ticket holders only 11am to 3pm, open to the public from 3pm)Friday and Saturday, September 6/7: 11am to 7pm\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement with exclusive updates and deeper insights into the global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i7 xDrive60: Power consumption in kWh/100 km: 27.03 (KR MOE, Ministry of Environment); Electric range in km: 438; CO2 emissions: 0 g/km."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From September 4 to 7, Frieze Seoul will open its doors at COEX in Gangnam for the third edition of the internationally renowned art fair in Asia.

At the finale of the 2023 MotoGP™ season in the Spanish city of Valencia, the focus was on the BMW XM Label Red (combined fuel consumption: 2.0 – 1.6 l/ 100 km; combined electricity consumption: 33.5 – 32.5 kWh/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 45 – 35 g/km in the WLTP cycle; figures for the NEDC cycle: – ) twice on Saturday. First, the top-of-the-range variant of the first BMW M high-performance car with an electric drive system was presented to the winner of the 2023 BMW M Award, Francesco Bagnaia. BMW M GmbH then unveiled the new BMW XM Label Red Safety Car for the 2024 MotoGP™ season.\n\nBMW M Award: The most powerful BMW M car for the fastest qualifier.\n\nIn its 25th year as “Official Car of MotoGP™”, BMW M GmbH once again provided an extraordinary highlight as the prize car for the BMW M Award, the BMW XM Label Red. It is the embodiment of extrovert lifestyle and a passion for absolute top performance. The BMW XM Label Red combines a performance-enhanced M HYBRID system, making it the most powerful BMW M automobile ever produced, with individual design accents. In keeping with tradition, the prize car was presented after the final qualifying of the season by Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports, and Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. This year, the BMW M Award was presented to the fastest qualifier in MotoGP™ for the 21st time, and the name of this season’s recipient went down in the exclusive winners list for the second time in a row.\n\nLike last year, the winner of the 2023 BMW M Award is Francesco “Pecco” Bagnaia. The Ducati rider has been particularly impressive in qualifying this season. Bagnaia consistently claimed top results in qualifying and had already wrapped up his second victory in the BMW M Award by the Thailand Grand Prix, with three events remaining. Over the course of the season, Bagnaia secured seven pole positions and started from the front row of the grid a further eight times. In total, he amassed 369 points in the BMW M Award, 93 more than his closest rival Jorge Martín.\n\n“Congratulations to Pecco Bagnaia! His speed in qualifying was particularly impressive this season,” said van Meel, CEO of BMW M, at the presentation. “The fact that he had won the BMW M Award before the end of the season this year speaks for itself. Respect! We are delighted to be able to honour this top rider with our top model, and are sure he is going to have a lot of fun with the BMW XM Label Red. His second win in a row means Pecco now joins a list of big names who have also won the BMW M Award on multiple occasions. This includes MotoGP legend Valentino Rossi who was awarded a BMW M winner’s car on three occasions and is very successful today on four wheels, as BMW M works driver in BMW M GT3 race cars.”\n\n“Welcome back to the BMW M Award presentation ceremony, and congratulations on your second win in a row, Pecco Bagnaia,” said Dorna Sports CEO Ezpeleta. “Pecco was regularly to be found at the top of the timings in qualifying this season and has thus more than earned this award. We would like to thank our close partner BMW M. With this coveted award, they have recognised the performances of our riders in qualifying for the 21st time. The BMW XM Red Label seamlessly continues the sequence of captivating prize cars, and I hope Pecco really enjoys his new high-performance car.”\n\n“Winning the BMW M Award for the first time last year was fantastic. Back then, I immediately set myself the goal of repeating the feat this season,” said Bagnaia. “As such, I am thrilled to have actually done it. Although it may look as though it was a stroll in the park this year, it was not. Every qualifying was extremely hard-fought. For this reason, I am proud to have come out on top again. I would like to say a big thank you to BMW M for this fantastic award. I promise I will do my best to win the BMW M Award again next year!”\n\nHigh-performance for the racetrack: the BMW XM Label Red Safety Car.\n\nNext season, the BMW XM Label Red will play a major role on the track: as the new MotoGP™ Safety Car. This will be the first time that a high-performance car with an electric drive system will lead the field in the pinnacle of motorcycle racing. Dorna CEO Ezpeleta and CEO of BMW M van Meel officially unveiled the BMW XM Label Red Safety Car on Saturday at the Valencia season finale. The new safety car will see action for the first time at the opening round of the 2024 season, which takes place in Qatar in March.\n\n“BMW M GmbH enters its 26th season as ‘Official Car of MotoGP’ in 2024. The company has always tasked itself with employing its technical innovations to help ensure safety at the racetrack,” said Ezpeleta. “The BMW XM Label Red Safety Car is another genuine highlight in the fleet of high-performance automobiles in use in MotoGP. We are already looking forward to seeing it on the track in Qatar.”\n\n“It is a logical step for the most powerful BMW M automobile we have ever rolled out to be the new figurehead of our safety car fleet in MotoGP,” said van Meel. “The first MotoGP Safety Car with an electric drive system is clear evidence of our striving for new, future-oriented technologies. In the BMW XM Label Red, a V8 engine and an e-motor integrated in the 8-speed M Steptronic gearbox generate a total output of 550 kW or 748 hp. This hugely powerful drive system, and outstanding driving dynamics in all situations, make the BMW XM Label Red the perfect basis for a MotoGP Safety Car.”\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red has been equipped with various safety car elements for its outings at the racetrack with MotoGP™. They include additional flashing front lights, the safety car roof bar, a front splitter, Recaro seats, six-point racing harness, and a fire extinguisher. When the new BMW XM Label Red MotoGP™ Safety Car makes its first appearance in March 2024, it will sport the typical BMW M livery.\n\nFor more information about BMW M GmbH and the involvement as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’, see: \n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: * BMW XM Label Red: combined fuel consumption: 2.0 – 1.6 l/ 100 km; combined electricity consumption: 33.5 – 32.5 kWh/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 45 – 35 g/km in the WLTP cycle; figures for the NEDC cycle: –"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At the finale of the 2023 MotoGP™ season in the Spanish city of Valencia, the focus was on the BMW XM Label Red* twice on Saturday.

With a total of 586,149 vehicles delivered to customers, the BMW Group’s global deliveries were largely in line with the previous year (-1.4%), despite subdued demand in China. In the first three months of 2025, the BMW Group saw growth in Europe (+6.2%) and the US (+4.0%), in particular. Outside of China, growth reached +5.9%.\n\nThe BMW Group continues its successful e-mobility ramp-up in 2025, navigating a volatile market environment with an attractive product line-up. The BMW Group delivered a total of 109,516 fully-electric BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide in the first three months of the year (+32.4%). Sales of fully-electric vehicles saw particularly strong growth in Europe (+64.2%).\n\n“The BMW Group’s technology-open strategy is proving successful. Our products are winning over customers worldwide across all drive technologies, with positive momentum driven, in particular, by the new MINI models – especially the fully-electric variants. One in three MINIs sold in Europe and more than one out of every two sold in China were fully-electric,” said Jochen Goller, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales.\n\n“We are feeling confident, thanks to significant growth in new orders across all drive technologies, particularly in our domestic market of Germany,” added Goller.\n\nThe BMW Group is set to reach two important milestones worldwide in 2025: First, a total of three million electrified vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) released onto the roads since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8, and, second, 1.5 million fully-electric vehicles (BEVs) delivered to customers.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, the BMW brand sold 520,142 units worldwide. The brand increased deliveries across all sales regions outside of China, outperforming the total market in the Europe region and growing its sales in the US.

The BMW Group headquarters in Munich, the neighbouring BMW Welt and the BMW Group Plant Leipzig have one thing in common: they are three award-winning architectural landmarks where aesthetics and functionality form a successful dialogue. They amaze and delight both inside and out, and demonstrate that the architecture of a commercial corporation also means responsibility — for the people who work in the buildings and for the cityscape that shapes them. In Munich, the Group headquarters, together with BMW Welt, have become a figurehead of the Bavarian state capital.\n\n“At the BMW Group, people and places go hand in hand. When planning new buildings, we always take a holistic view. What spatial structure the respective areas require, what environment our employees need for good teamwork and how we use space efficiently are central aspects to be considered. Architecture creates something lasting. At the BMW Group, we see it as part of our social responsibility to make a valuable contribution to our employees and our environment,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Real Estate, and Labour Relations Director.\n\nArchitecture Day on 29 and 30 June is an occasion for the BMW Group to take a look at its iconic buildings and show how architecture creates spaces for innovation and modern ways of working.\n\nAt the BMW Group, real estate and personnel development are closely interlinked. Employees, their respective competencies and required space work together and determine building structures. Sustainable and optimal space planning, particularly in light of energy consumption, is just as important as creating a positive and pleasant room atmosphere in which employees feel comfortable. Successful interior design is based on the needs of the people who work there. It promotes efficiency, interactions and creativity. It is when a brilliant and fitting idea is consistently and confidently implemented in command of what is possible. This corporate culture is a recurring thread throughout the BMW Group’s architectural statements.\n\nA landmark shapes the BMW Group’s architectural language\n\nThe BMW Group headquarters in Munich, the distinctive four-cylinder engine, has achieved world fame. The landmark completed in 1972, planned by Austrian architect Professor Karl Schwanzer, was bold and visionary at the time. The construction alone — from top to bottom using a suspended structure — was and is spectacular. The building became the springboard for the company’s architectural philosophy, which still applies today: a precise, timeless and self-confident design language represents the Group to the outside world and at the same time forges a building structure that creates meeting places and functional spaces for efficient work processes inside.\n\nBMW Welt: Architecture enhances experience\n\nThe approach that architecture creates places of encounter was consistently implemented with BMW Welt, which opened in 2007 at the Group location in Munich. Here, the BMW Group brands — BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad — come alive, people from all nations meet, future topics become visible. Designed by the Viennese team of architects Coop Himmelb(l)au, the futuristic building, which is connected to the corporate headquarters and the BMW Museum via a dynamically spanned bridge, attracts an audience of millions of every year. It is impossible to imagine Munich’s cityscape without the listed BMW Welt, the company’s shop window, as it were. It is a building that wows people — both inside and outside — and whose visit lives long in the memory.\n\nTransparency at BMW Group plant in Leipzig\n\nThe BMW Group plant in Leipzig also joins the ranks of architectural icons. The building, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects of London and opened in 2005, is another example of how architecture supports communication and encounter. The building, which was awarded the German Architecture Prize, works with maximum transparency: the manufactured cars float on a 600-metre-long, open conveyor line through the building, visible to everyone, even from the canteen. Working in the building is characterised by short distances between production areas, transparent and efficient work processes, and a high level of communication and cooperation across specialist areas.\n\nArchitecture creates spaces for new ways of working\n\nWorking environments are changing, job requirements have changed. At the BMW Group, employees work together in cross-thematic and cross-functional teams; meetings and knowledge-sharing are encouraged. Architecture creates the spaces for this future-oriented work: workplaces are used flexibly, there are meeting areas that enable spontaneous and low-threshold meetings, and in addition, retreat spaces allow concentrated work. Design goes beyond purely functional requirements: architecture has the potential to design places where employees feel comfortable and promote innovative thinking and creative exchange. The BMW Group is pursuing this approach with ConnectedWorkplace and is implementing it at all existing and new locations worldwide.\n\nTalent Campus as a meeting place\n\nThe modern Talent Campus, which is currently being built at the Group site in Munich and is becoming the BMW Group’s new training and continuing education hub, is a good example of how architecture creates spaces for collaboration and at the same time how a building enriches its environment. In the modern structure, which is transparently designed with large windows and in which the more than 40,000 employees in Munich will receive training and continuing education in the future, the rooms are open and can be used in variable ways. The room layout can be adjusted or retrofitted at any time, making the construction particularly sustainable. The redesigned green spaces become a meeting point between production and the neighbourhood, and a public café invites visitors to exchange ideas. The construction also moves with the times: while in the four-cylinder façade elements made from cast aluminium processes were the eye-catcher, the Talent Campus is a wooden structure. The renewable raw material creates a natural effect and a warm room atmosphere that invites you to learn.\n\nParent plant in Munich: Working environments allow networking\n\nEmployees are also dealing with new topics in terms of content. Digitalisation and electric mobility require a new working environment. The restructuring of the BMW Group parent plant in Munich, not far from the Group headquarters, shows just how profound this change is. The parent plant is being redesigned as the largest investment project in the company’s history to produce the all-electric Neue Klasse in the future. This is where content transformation and architectural development go hand in hand. Once again, visionary thinking is about to break ground: as part of the architecture competition, the two architecture firms OMA from Rotterdam and 3XN from Copenhagen have created visions that enable technologies and employees to be networked. In the long term, the aim is to create a connection between the plant site and the neighbourhood and city.

At the BMW Group, employees work together in cross-thematic and cross-functional teams; meetings and knowledge-sharing are encouraged. Architecture creates the spaces for this future-oriented work: workplaces are used flexibly, there are meeting areas that enable spontaneous and low-threshold meetings, and in addition, retreat spaces allow concentrated work. Design goes beyond purely functional requirements: architecture has the potential to design places where employees feel comfortable and promote innovative thinking and creative exchange. The BMW Group is pursuing this approach with ConnectedWorkplace and is implementing it at all existing and new locations worldwide.\n\nTalent Campus as a meeting place\n\nThe modern Talent Campus, which is currently being built at the Group site in Munich and is becoming the BMW Group’s new training and continuing education hub, is a good example of how architecture creates spaces for collaboration and at the same time how a building enriches its environment. In the modern structure, which is transparently designed with large windows and in which the more than 40,000 employees in Munich will receive training and continuing education in the future, the rooms are open and can be used in variable ways. The room layout can be adjusted or retrofitted at any time, making the construction particularly sustainable. The redesigned green spaces become a meeting point between production and the neighbourhood, and a public café invites visitors to exchange ideas. The construction also moves with the times: while in the four-cylinder façade elements made from cast aluminium processes were the eye-catcher, the Talent Campus is a wooden structure. The renewable raw material creates a natural effect and a warm room atmosphere that invites you to learn.\n\nParent plant in Munich: Working environments allow networking\n\nEmployees are also dealing with new topics in terms of content. Digitalisation and electric mobility require a new working environment. The restructuring of the BMW Group parent plant in Munich, not far from the Group headquarters, shows just how profound this change is. The parent plant is being redesigned as the largest investment project in the company’s history to produce the all-electric Neue Klasse in the future. This is where content transformation and architectural development go hand in hand. Once again, visionary thinking is about to break ground: as part of the architecture competition, the two architecture firms OMA from Rotterdam and 3XN from Copenhagen have created visions that enable technologies and employees to be networked. In the long term, the aim is to create a connection between the plant site and the neighbourhood and city.

The BMW Group headquarters in Munich, the neighbouring BMW Welt and the BMW Group Plant Leipzig have one thing in common: they are three award-winning architectural landmarks where aesthetics and functionality form a successful dialogue. They amaze and delight both inside and out, and demonstrate that the architecture of a commercial corporation also means responsibility — for the people who work in the buildings and for the cityscape that shapes them. In Munich, the Group headquarters, together with BMW Welt, have become a figurehead of the Bavarian state capital.\n\n“At the BMW Group, people and places go hand in hand. When planning new buildings, we always take a holistic view. What spatial structure the respective areas require, what environment our employees need for good teamwork and how we use space efficiently are central aspects to be considered. Architecture creates something lasting. At the BMW Group, we see it as part of our social responsibility to make a valuable contribution to our employees and our environment,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Real Estate, and Labour Relations Director.\n\nArchitecture Day on 29 and 30 June is an occasion for the BMW Group to take a look at its iconic buildings and show how architecture creates spaces for innovation and modern ways of working.\n\nAt the BMW Group, real estate and personnel development are closely interlinked. Employees, their respective competencies and required space work together and determine building structures. Sustainable and optimal space planning, particularly in light of energy consumption, is just as important as creating a positive and pleasant room atmosphere in which employees feel comfortable. Successful interior design is based on the needs of the people who work there. It promotes efficiency, interactions and creativity. It is when a brilliant and fitting idea is consistently and confidently implemented in command of what is possible. This corporate culture is a recurring thread throughout the BMW Group’s architectural statements.\n\nA landmark shapes the BMW Group’s architectural language\n\nThe BMW Group headquarters in Munich, the distinctive four-cylinder engine, has achieved world fame. The landmark completed in 1972, planned by Austrian architect Professor Karl Schwanzer, was bold and visionary at the time. The construction alone — from top to bottom using a suspended structure — was and is spectacular. The building became the springboard for the company’s architectural philosophy, which still applies today: a precise, timeless and self-confident design language represents the Group to the outside world and at the same time forges a building structure that creates meeting places and functional spaces for efficient work processes inside.\n\nBMW Welt: Architecture enhances experience\n\nThe approach that architecture creates places of encounter was consistently implemented with BMW Welt, which opened in 2007 at the Group location in Munich. Here, the BMW Group brands — BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad — come alive, people from all nations meet, future topics become visible. Designed by the Viennese team of architects Coop Himmelb(l)au, the futuristic building, which is connected to the corporate headquarters and the BMW Museum via a dynamically spanned bridge, attracts an audience of millions of every year. It is impossible to imagine Munich’s cityscape without the listed BMW Welt, the company’s shop window, as it were. It is a building that wows people — both inside and outside — and whose visit lives long in the memory.\n\nTransparency at BMW Group plant in Leipzig\n\nThe BMW Group plant in Leipzig also joins the ranks of architectural icons. The building, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects of London and opened in 2005, is another example of how architecture supports communication and encounter. The building, which was awarded the German Architecture Prize, works with maximum transparency: the manufactured cars float on a 600-metre-long, open conveyor line through the building, visible to everyone, even from the canteen. Working in the building is characterised by short distances between production areas, transparent and efficient work processes, and a high level of communication and cooperation across specialist areas.\n\nArchitecture creates spaces for new ways of working\n\nWorking environments are changing, job requirements have changed. At the BMW Group, employees work together in cross-thematic and cross-functional teams; meetings and knowledge-sharing are encouraged.

The BMW Group is pursuing this approach with ConnectedWorkplace and is implementing it at all existing and new locations worldwide.\n\nTalent Campus as a meeting place\n\nThe modern Talent Campus, which is currently being built at the Group site in Munich and is becoming the BMW Group’s new training and continuing education hub, is a good example of how architecture creates spaces for collaboration and at the same time how a building enriches its environment.

The future BMW Group plant in the Hungarian city of Debrecen is on the finish straight as the ramp-up of the assembly line sees the heart of the plant come to life. This is the beating heart of all the technologies in the plant, and also where the most employees work. The assembly launch thus marks the reaching of another milestone.\n\n“Our highly efficient and ergonomic assembly line immediately started running without any issues,” said Hans-Peter Kemser, Managing Director BMW Group Plant Debrecen. “We achieved this thanks to virtual planning and tests, as well as the outstanding collaboration between our new, highly motivated employees in Debrecen and our experts within the BMW Group’s global production network.”\n\nIn assembly, the individual components and systems are installed in the painted body – at the end of the process, a car ready to drive rolls off the production line. The innovative vehicle architecture of the Neue Klasse opens totally new possibilities with regard to assembly: greater efficiency thanks to modularisation, fewer different connecting elements, and a simplified installation of the wiring harness. An innovative cockpit assembly also accelerates the process.\n\nThe BMW Group Plant Debrecen is already producing test vehicles for the first model of the Neue Klasse: the new BMW iX3.* Thus, the new plant is gradually ramping up for series production.\n\nNeue Klasse allows simple, fast assembly process\n\nA number of features of the Neue Klasse are new territory for everyone. Unlike in previous models, the cable harness is divided into multiple parts, making it easier and more ergonomic to install. The zonal wiring harness architecture requires 600 fewer metres of wiring and weighs 30 percent less than the previous generation.\n\nOn the other hand, some components are modularised when one module is formed from many small individual parts. The variation of connecting elements has also been radically reduced for the Neue Klasse. This in turn reduces the number of different plugs, screws and clips. All of this makes assembly significantly more simple.\n\nFurthermore, with the Neue Klasse, a wide range of quality checks can be performed digitally whilst still on the production line. This procedure will also be implemented at other sites after its initial use in Debrecen. The next point of use will be the home plant in Munich, which will produce the sedan model of the Neue Klasse as of 2026.\n\nThe innovative cockpit assembly accelerates processes at Plant Debrecen. It is one of the most compact in the BMW Group’s production network, yet still allows full flexibility and variety. As at Plant Lydia in China, cockpit pre-assembly is located right next to the main line. Once the cockpit has been pre-assembled, it is then installed directly in the vehicle just a few metres ahead.\n\nAssembly in Debrecen adopts innovations from existing plants\n\nWhen planning the new production site in Hungary, the BMW Group used a completely virtual design process. In line with the principles of the BMW iFACTORY, the tried-and-tested standards and high-tech solutions from existing plants were referred to many times. For example, many ideas and proven structures from Plant Lydia in China and Plant Leipzig can be found in the assembly in Debrecen.\n\nFurther development of the finger structure from Leipzig\n\nThese structures include the so-called finger structure, or comb structure, which the BMW Group developed specifically for Plant Leipzig, which opened in 2005. This structure allows supply parts and preassembled modules to be transported directly to the assembly lines. A record proportion of parts, up to 80%, can be delivered directly in Debrecen, as the fingers will enjoy logistics supply from both sides for the first time. This is the highest ratio in the BMW Group’s production network. The finger structure allows subsequent extension and the integration of further assembly steps – flexibility is a characteristic of production at the BMW Group.\n\nProduction processes, as at Plant Lydia in China\n\nPlant Lydia in China was also an inspiration for many structures and processes in the assembly. The plant opened in 2022 and was the first BMW Group site to be completely planned and simulated in the virtual world from the outset.

Thank you to all the BMW M Motorsport employees who support us so magnificently.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “Every time I race in my home country, it seems to go fantastically well. I have been here three times now and have finished on the podium each time – and won twice. The first victory was very special, but this was even more emotional, as I had a lot of friends and family at the track. I really had goosebumps on the podium. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and compliments to WRT for that performance in only the third race with BMW.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “A great weekend for us all. Right from day one, we improved the race pace and did a perfect job. The safety car made it a bit close again for the last 25 minutes, but Sheldon brought the win home perfectly.

I feel much more at home in the car after my second race. I am really very happy.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#33 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “That was my first race with WRT and I was very intrigued to see how the team goes about its work.

I had an awful lot of fun here in Kyalami.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#33 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “From a team perspective, it does not get any better than that. We really did a perfect job. We knew from the start of the weekend that we had a strong package. However, we got the very best out of it. I cannot thank BMW M Motorsport and the team enough. We are now very well positioned in the championship. A great result so early in the season.”\n\nMaxime Martin (#33 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “For the team, you cannot get a better result than a one-two.

Valentino Rossi (ITA) will enter his second year in the LMGT3 category of the FIA WEC with the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. He will share the cockpit with newcomer Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA). In the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO, BMW M works driver Augusto Farfus (BRA) will be joined by two new partners, Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin. In the IMSA series, Paul Miller Racing will compete with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs and an all-works driver line-up in the GTD PRO class. Turner Motorsport will also rely on works driver support in the GTD category .\n\nFIA WEC: Second attempt at Le Mans victory and world championship title.\n\nTeam WRT enters the 2025 FIA WEC season with the goal of competing for victory in the LMGT3 class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) and the world championship title. Once again, nine-time motorcycle world champion Valentino Rossi is part of the team. He will share the cockpit of the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO with Kelvin van der Linde and Ahmad Al Harthy. While Al Harthy was Rossi's teammate in 2024, van der Linde joins as a new BMW M works driver.\n\nIn the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO, there are two changes. Augusto Farfus – who finished second at Le Mans and fourth in the championship standings in 2024 – remains on board and will share the cockpit with newcomers Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin. Boguslavskiy has an impressive history in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, where he competed alongside current BMW M works driver Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and was crowned champion in 2020 and 2023. Shahin competed in the 2024 FIA WEC season for Team Manthey EMA, finishing second in the championship standings. Along the way, he triumphed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). In 2021 and 2022, Shahin won the title in the GT World Challenge Australia. In 2024, he won the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS) in the Pro-Am class.\n\nIMSA series: Ten BMW M works drivers in three BMW M4 GT3 EVOs.\n\nThe IMSA series season traditionally begins at the end of January with a season highlight, the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). A total of ten BMW M works drivers will take the wheel of three BMW M4 GT3 EVOs for the Paul Miller Racing and Turner Motorsport teams, five of whom will compete throughout the entire IMSA season. Paul Miller Racing will field two cars in the GTD PRO class. In the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, the two Americans, Madison Snow and Neil Verhagen, will compete for the entire season. They will be supported by Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) at endurance races. The South African will make his racing debut as a BMW M works driver at the 24h Daytona. In the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) will enter their first IMSA season. Additional drivers at endurance races are Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA).\n\nTurner Motorsport will field the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GTD category.

I congratulate Team WRT on once again securing some of the best Silver and Bronze drivers for the cockpits of our two new BMW M4 GT3 EVOs. They will hopefully create many great moments alongside our three works drivers. In the IMSA series, Paul Miller Racing is going all out with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs in the GTD PRO class, supported by a high-class selection of works drivers. The reunion of the former BMW Junior Team with Dan Harper, Max Hesse, and Neil Verhagen in one championship and team is a great bonus that underlines the extreme success of the relaunch of the legendary BMW M Motorsport talent promotion programme.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “In the 2025 season, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO makes its debut, and the FIA WEC and IMSA series are two of the most prestigious arenas for the car. Accordingly, our determination to achieve immediate success and demonstrate what the car is capable of is great. The strong driver line-ups of the WRT, Paul Miller Racing, and Turner Motorsport teams provide the optimal conditions for this. Looking at the IMSA series, I am thrilled with how Paul Miller Racing is approaching the new season. With the team's experience, the new car, and the driver line-up, the focus can only be on targeting the title in the GTD PRO class. Turner Motorsport was in contention for the GTD championship for a long time in 2024. I am convinced that Will Turner's experienced team will play a great role again in the upcoming season. I can hardly wait for the first races.“\n\nValentino Rossi: “Very happy to continue my experience in the FIA WEC, as last year was a strong debut season. We had some good races including two podiums and we want to try to be stronger and faster. We will work hard together with BMW M Motorsport to improve our performance and be more competitive in every race. It’s great to once again race at some fantastic tracks, that I know well from racing motorcycles, and this makes me enjoy racing in the FIA WEC. Le Mans is of course the most important one, we were unlucky last year, but we will fight for the podium in 2025!”\n\nDriver line-ups overview:\n\n#31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO:\n\nTimur Boguslavskiy (Silver)\n\nYasser Shahin (Bronze)\n\n#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Pro)\n\nValentino Rossi (Silver)\n\nAhmad Al Harthy (Bronze)\n\n#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, GTD PRO:\n\nConnor De Phillippi (Endurance)\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Endurance)\n\n#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, GTD PRO:\n\nJesse Krohn (Endurance)\n\nAugusto Farfus (Endurance)\n\n#96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, GTD:\n\nJake Walker (Endurance)\n\nJens Klingmann (24h Daytona)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Just a few weeks after announcing the Hypercar line-up, the GT drivers who will represent BMW M Motorsport in 2025 in the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) have been confirmed."}]}

A total of ten BMW M works drivers will take the wheel of three BMW M4 GT3 EVOs for the Paul Miller Racing and Turner Motorsport teams, five of whom will compete throughout the entire IMSA season. Paul Miller Racing will field two cars in the GTD PRO class. In the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, the two Americans, Madison Snow and Neil Verhagen, will compete for the entire season. They will be supported by Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) at endurance races. The South African will make his racing debut as a BMW M works driver at the 24h Daytona. In the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) will enter their first IMSA season. Additional drivers at endurance races are Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA).\n\nTurner Motorsport will field the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GTD category.

I congratulate Team WRT on once again securing some of the best Silver and Bronze drivers for the cockpits of our two new BMW M4 GT3 EVOs. They will hopefully create many great moments alongside our three works drivers. In the IMSA series, Paul Miller Racing is going all out with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs in the GTD PRO class, supported by a high-class selection of works drivers. The reunion of the former BMW Junior Team with Dan Harper, Max Hesse, and Neil Verhagen in one championship and team is a great bonus that underlines the extreme success of the relaunch of the legendary BMW M Motorsport talent promotion programme.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “In the 2025 season, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO makes its debut, and the FIA WEC and IMSA series are two of the most prestigious arenas for the car. Accordingly, our determination to achieve immediate success and demonstrate what the car is capable of is great. The strong driver line-ups of the WRT, Paul Miller Racing, and Turner Motorsport teams provide the optimal conditions for this. Looking at the IMSA series, I am thrilled with how Paul Miller Racing is approaching the new season. With the team's experience, the new car, and the driver line-up, the focus can only be on targeting the title in the GTD PRO class. Turner Motorsport was in contention for the GTD championship for a long time in 2024. I am convinced that Will Turner's experienced team will play a great role again in the upcoming season. I can hardly wait for the first races.“\n\nValentino Rossi: “Very happy to continue my experience in the FIA WEC, as last year was a strong debut season. We had some good races including two podiums and we want to try to be stronger and faster. We will work hard together with BMW M Motorsport to improve our performance and be more competitive in every race. It’s great to once again race at some fantastic tracks, that I know well from racing motorcycles, and this makes me enjoy racing in the FIA WEC. Le Mans is of course the most important one, we were unlucky last year, but we will fight for the podium in 2025!”\n\nDriver line-ups overview:\n\n#31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO:\n\nTimur Boguslavskiy (Silver)\n\nYasser Shahin (Bronze)\n\n#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Pro)\n\nValentino Rossi (Silver)\n\nAhmad Al Harthy (Bronze)\n\n#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, GTD PRO:\n\nConnor De Phillippi (Endurance)\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Endurance)\n\n#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, GTD PRO:\n\nJesse Krohn (Endurance)\n\nAugusto Farfus (Endurance)\n\n#96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, GTD:\n\nJake Walker (Endurance)\n\nJens Klingmann (24h Daytona)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport presents high-class LMGT3 and GTD driver line-ups for the FIA WEC and IMSA series."}]}

This combines several advantages. There is a large selection of shoe styles, so athletes can use a shoe that suits their individual needs. The material and geometry of the plate, as well as the placement of the spike nails, can be used to vary the rigidity and, above all, the power transmission to the ice.

The BMW Group has brought the Dentsu media agency on board to kickstart its new European media strategy for the BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad brands. From 1 January 2026, Dentsu will also support the BMW Group globally. This means that the expertise of Dentsu – one of the world’s leading marketing and communications agencies – will be used to create a uniform and powerful media presence. As part of the new constellation, media and marketing approaches are being adapted to the requirements of digitalisation and sustainability. The focus here is on artificial intelligence (AI), centralised data management, hybrid teams and integrated platforms (media hubs). The aim is to make campaigns more efficient, more targeted and more responsible.\n\n“I am personally very excited to have Dentsu as our new media agency partner. Together we are entering a new chapter for a communication truly focused on the European customer,” says Uwe Dreher, Vice President Marketing BMW Europe, and adds: “Our goal to act in a highly data-driven and targeted multi-channel and multiple market planning approach elevated via state-of-the-art AI tools to increase efficiency and impact has been reached – the execution will accelerate marketing Return on Investment for our markets even further. BMW Marketing Europe is excited to be launching our Neue Klasse in this new constellation.”\n\nTailor-made communications for the Neue Klasse era.The aim of the call for tenders was to ensure seamless, brand-compliant BMW Group communications across all media channels – at both the national and international level. Awarding the European media business to Dentsu is an important step towards implementing the European media strategy. The consolidation of media activities forms the basis of a standardised solution across all of Europe. The launch of the new agency constellation coincides with the market launch of the Neue Klasse and marks a new era, characterised by highly innovative vehicle technologies on the one hand and a fundamentally new understanding of the brand and communications on the other. The new media approach reflects this transformation.\n\nAI-controlled, with a centralised European media hub.\n\nThe comprehensive use of artificial intelligence will be a key factor. Advanced AI tools will bring even greater precision to media planning. Target groups will be recognised and reached more accurately and decisions made on the basis of concrete data – measurable performance indicators. This will verifiably increase the real-time effectiveness and efficiency of advertising across all customer touchpoints.\n\nAnother key element of the new set-up is the creation of an integrated media hub. Online and offline media will be seamlessly combined on this platform. This enables cross-channel synergies to be recognised and exploited. It helps ensure transparency and makes for efficient planning and implementation. Centralisation enables consolidated control of all activities and channels as well as centralised data analysis. Even so, there will always be room for localisation: national market conditions and cultural specifics – and differentiated responses to them – are additional factors for success.\n\nIntegration of all BMW Group brands.\n\nThe new media strategy follows a multi-brand approach: BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad will be looked at in combination. This creates new opportunities for optimisation across the various media, supported by hybrid teams combining on‑shore, near-shore and off-shore expertise. This know-how from many international markets creates additional flexibility and quality in implementation and is a response to the rapidly changing requirements in the international media business.\n\nCustomer focus: media optimisation along the entire customer journey.The new model consistently focuses on the customer journey – from the first impulse, the first encounter, all the way to vehicle purchase. Target groups are addressed more precisely, delivering even greater emotional and situation-specific impact. The transition to a more performance-focused planning approach, where factors such as real-time data and sales targets play a key role, significantly increases the measurable impact of media communications. At the same time, the planning approach supports direct sales and aids the transformation towards a sustainable retail model.\n\nSustainability and responsibility in media communications.Another key consideration in the BMW Group’s choice of agency partner was sustainability.

Employees of the future Plant Debrecen have moved into the central Communication Centre, where they are joining forces for the final stretch before the official series launch of the NEUE KLASSE. Debrecen Plant Director Hans-Peter Kemser is pleased with construction progress: “In just a few months, pre-series production will get underway here in Debrecen, setting new standards – not just for the vehicles themselves, but also for processes here at the plant. The Communication Centre will support us by creating short lines of communication and enabling a good exchange of information between all technologies at any time.” The architecture also supports the concept of the BMW iFACTORY, which will be fully implemented in Debrecen.\n\nWhile non-production employees are already settling into their workplaces on-site, production staff are preparing for their future roles at Plant Debrecen within the company’s global production network. This will ensure a smooth start to pre-series production in 2024 and the successful series launch of the first NEUE KLASSE model in 2025.\n\nModel of Leipzig central building further optimised\n\nInspired by the central building at BMW Group Plant Leipzig, the Communication Centre in Debrecen will also link the production technologies of the body shop, paint shop and assembly. In Debrecen, this underlying principle was further developed with the creation of a central building where the network idea is paramount. The open architecture provides both meeting spaces and sequestered workplaces. The two-storey Communication Centre is about 19,000 square metres in size; around half of this area will be office space.\n\nThe three main production areas are situated around the administrative area. The Communication Centre is not just where colleagues come together, but also people and products: From the body shop, which is adjacent to the office building on the right, unpainted car bodies will make their way on a conveyor belt, visible above people's heads, through the Communication Centre to the paint shop, located centrally behind it. From there, the painted bodies will be transported back through the office building to the vehicle assembly, which is to the left. This means that everyone who does not work directly in production can still see the product at all times.\n\nThe multifunctional staff restaurant can also be used for meetings outside of mealtimes. This is located on the ground floor as well, along with the central marketplace and health centre. A state-of-the-art laboratory also found home in the Communication Center's ground floor area in 1,300 square meters. The colleagues of the laboratory will be responsible for the premium quality of the colors of the Neue Klasse models. The 700-square meter, well-equipped Health Center of the Plant will be operating in the building as well to take care of the colleagues' health and well-being, while also carrying out prevention and screening campaigns. The upper floor is occupied by offices.\n\nArchitectural concept based on principles of BMW iFACTORY\n\nDigitalisation is playing a major role in construction of the plant – the virtual start of production for Plant Debrecen's digital twin already took place in March 2023. The importance of digitalisation is also reflected in the Communication Centre’s equipment. Meeting rooms feature modern digital elements that enable virtual collaboration throughout the plant and beyond.\n\nThe principles of the BMW iFACTORY were already taken into consideration during the planning phase. 5G technology is used throughout the grounds and paper is rarely seen at the Debrecen plant – which aims to be virtually paperless.\n\nOther resources will be used carefully as well. When choosing the furniture, easy-to-recycle materials were preferred, with extensive use of wood. Plant Debrecen will also operate entirely without fossil fuels."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Debrecen Plant Director Hans-Peter Kemser: “Another milestone on the road to the NEUE KLASSE” +++ Surrounded by all production technologies: Communication Centre as central hub +++ Already more than 1,000 employees in Debrecen +++"}]}
