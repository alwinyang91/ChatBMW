Gerhard Richter, one of the most renowned contemporary painters, has had an enduring influence on the art world. His “Red – Yellow – Blue“ group is a fascinating series of paintings; brushstrokes opulently enlarged, combining colour and form in a harmonious yet challenging way. For 50 years, they have been the centrepiece of the entrance foyer of the BMW four-cylinder headquarters building, Karl Schwanzer’s architectural icon – arguably the world’s most spectacular corporate lobby. The paintings have been extensively restored to mark this anniversary and are newly presented in specially designed glass showcases.\n\nThe BMW Group commissioned the comprehensive restoration of this impressive group of works as part of its long-term commitment to culture and art. The latest technologies and techniques were used to restore the original brilliance and intensity of Richter’s colours while respecting the integrity of his original vision. From now on, the paintings will be presented in specially built UV-protected and air-conditioned glass showcases that meet modern conservation standards, yet recreate the presentation originally envisaged by the artist.\n\n“Gerhard Richter’s art inspires, provokes and stimulates us to think in fresh ways that transcend the limitations of colour and form,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate. “We are proud to present his group of works in our Headquarters in a new way which honors their significance. Richter’s paintings are the nucleus of our 50-year-long commitment to international culture, reason enough on its own for them to be so very close to our hearts.”\n\nRichter’s works were often created from photographs of colour samples that he had personally mixed on a palette. The three “Red – Yellow – Blue” large-format paintings, which Richter created in 1973 for BMW Headquarters in Munich, are highlights of this artistic approach. The group of works, never shown outside the foyer, marks the first conclusion of Richter’s exploration of the palette motif. He subsequently also concentrated on abstract painting, which resulted from mixing the three primary colours on the canvas, or on paintings in which he created lively pictorial surfaces with grey structures. Richter’s work is often formulated from photographic originals collected in his “Atlas”, a collection of photographs, collages, and sketches that he has amassed since 1962 and which is housed in the Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus in Munich.\n\nDr Matthias Mühling, director of the Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau in Munich, adds: “Gerhard Richter’s ‘Red – Yellow – Blue’ represents a significant exploration of the possibilities and limits of painting. Richter explores the very essence of painting itself by using the three primary colours that form the basis of all other colours. The group shows his ongoing exploration of abstraction and figuration, and how these two poles of painting can influence and inform each other. Richter makes us realise through these works that painting is both a means of representing and abstracting reality and challenges us to rethink our own ideas of what painting can be.”\n\nThe restoration of the three-by-six-metre “Red – Yellow – Blue” paintings is a remarkable undertaking that calls for the use of modern technologies and techniques. Richter’s artworks had lost some of their colour brilliance over the years. Therefore the restoration’s main aim was to restore the original depth of colour and unity of these masterpieces. A team of experts, including art historians, material scientists and restorers, used innovative techniques to tackle this formidable task and create an authentic restoration plan.\n\n“It took precision, care, and patience to restore the three large-scale paintings. The original substance was extensively conserved and restored in the process. Fine colour transitions and nuances were restored using specially developed colour blends. The original depth of colour and unity is once again revealed and Gerhard Richter’s impressive work brought to life again for BMW,” explains restorer Ekkehard Kneer.\n\nThe first publication on the group of works was the volume “Gerhard Richter. Red – Yellow – Blue. The Paintings for BMW” from Prestel Publishing in 2007. It illustrates the development of Richter’s pictorial motifs and poses questions about modernism and the transition to postmodernism. The context of the paintings and the history of the location – the BMW Group plant in Munich, the Olympic grounds, and BMW Headquarters – is also explored."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gerhard Richter's “Red – Yellow – Blue“ group is a fascinating series of paintings; brushstrokes opulently enlarged, combining colour and form in a harmonious yet challenging way.

A total of 50,096 readers took part in the poll.\n\nIn the “Sports Bikes” category, the BMW M 1000 RR continues to dominate this highly competitive segment for the third year in a row with a 19.9 per cent share of the vote. With its fascinating mix of sporty riding dynamics on country roads, top racetrack performance and state-of-the-art ride safety systems, it is once again in first place in the readers' favour for 2023.\n\nThe R 1250 RS is another repeat winner. Following the clear victories of the past years, the R 1250 RS is the winner in the “Tourer/Sport Tourer” segment once again.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport made important progress at the sixth round of the 2023 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Donington Park (GBR). Scott Redding (GBR) and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team secured a top-four finish at their home race. Garrett Gerloff (USA) and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team also showed good form. However, the positive results were overshadowed by a serious accident at the start of the second main race. Tom Sykes (GBR) crashed. Loris Baz (FRA) and Michael Ruben Rinaldi (ITA / Ducati) subsequently got involved in the incident and also went down. Sykes suffered multiple rib fractures and was taken to the hospital for further examination. Rinaldi also had to get medical treatment. Baz remained uninjured but did not participate in the restart of the second race.\n\nIn Saturday morning’s Superpole qualifying session, Sykes was the highest-placed BMW rider in eighth position. However, he had some bad luck in the closely contested session. On his second run, he was on his way to a standout lap time but was slowed by a yellow flag in the final sector. Gerloff followed in tenth place, Redding finished twelfth, and Baz ended Superpole in fifteenth position.\n\nIn the first race on Saturday afternoon, Sykes maintained a position in the top-eight until the final lap, while Redding steadily climbed up from twelfth place. Just before the finish line, Redding overtook Sykes, crossing the line in eighth position and achieving his second-best race result of the season. Sykes finished directly behind in ninth place. Unfortunately, the first race didn’t go well for the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team. Gerloff was touched by another rider in the first corner and crashed. Although he initially continued the race after a quick check in the garage, he had to retire prematurely. Baz retired due to a technical issue.\n\nThe goal in Sunday’s Superpole race was to improve on the starting positions for the second main race in the afternoon. Gerloff succeeded by working his way up to seventh place, while Redding finished ninth. Sykes was in eighth place until the penultimate lap but then crashed. He resumed the race and finished in 18th position. Baz had an early fall in the race but was also able to continue and crossed the finish line in 23rd place.\n\nAfter the restart of Sunday’s second main race, Redding initially held eighth position before steadily advancing through the field in the second half of the race. On the 19th out of a total of 22 laps, he moved up to fourth place and successfully defended it until the end. That secured his best race result of the season so far. Gerloff had a great start and held fifth position for a long time but dropped back slightly in the field to finish ninth, securing another top-ten result.\n\nThe seventh round of the WorldSBK 2023 will take place from 14th to 16th July at Imola, Italy.\n\nBMW F 900 R Cup in the WorldSBK support programme.\n\nAs part of the WorldSBK support programme, the ABK Beer 0% BMW F 900 R Cup made its appearance at Donington Park. The one-make cup, which has its debut season in 2023, offers highly competitive and cost-effective racing. The races take place during weekends of the British Superbike Championship, in addition to the WorldSBK event at Donington Park. The riders compete on identical BMW F 900 R Roadster bikes with 105 horsepower.\n\nThe third event of the season’s BMW F 900 R Cup races provided thrilling action. On Saturday, two heats of eight laps each were on the schedule. In the first race, Richard Cooper (GBR / FHO Racing BMW Motorrad) claimed victory ahead of Thomas Strudwick (GBR / Art of Racing) and Barry Burrell (GBR / Mallory Performance Racing). In the second race, Nikki Coates (GBR / Ernie Coates Track Days/AOR Racing) took the win, followed by Michael Rutter (GBR / Bathams Racing) and Christian Smith (GBR / SCH Motoprep/Smith Twins Racing). The main race over 14 laps took place on Sunday afternoon. This time, Cooper secured a clear victory, with Strudwick and Rutter completing the podium. The winner’s trophies were presented by Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad.\n\nReactions to the Donington Park round.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It was a weekend that we conclude with mixed emotions. The weekend started off difficult due to the unpredictable weather. Both practice sessions on Friday had partly wet conditions, making it challenging to prepare for the races, but that applied to everyone, of course. Even in FP3 on Saturday morning, there were damp patches on the track, and qualifying was more or less the first dry session. We were performing quite well there. Tom had the potential to put the bike on the front row in ‘Tomington’ but he was unlucky with the yellow flag. With the other guys, we didn't immediately find the right setup for the newly resurfaced track due to the lack of time in the practice sessions, however we had a stable pace with good results in the first race. Therefore, we started Sunday with confidence. Garrett also showed a good and consistent performance in the Superpole race, improving to seventh place. Tom also gave a strong performance with stable lap times but had a small slide. As a result, Scott took ninth place. We had a good pace in this race as well.\n\nThe second main race started with Tom’s terrible crash, which subsequently affected Loris and Michael Ruben Rinaldi. It has just been confirmed that Tom has multiple rib fractures. He is currently undergoing further examinations in the hospital. We wish him a speedy recovery, and at this point, as BMW Motorrad, we would also like to send our best wishes to Michael. Fortunately, Loris was relatively okay after the accident, but he had fallen on his head and decided not to participate in the restart. Garrett had a very good start but then dropped back a bit. Scott grew stronger throughout the race, ploughed through the field, and in an extremely exciting battle, especially against the Kawasakis, secured a very strong fourth place. Just under two seconds behind, Garrett crossed the finish line in ninth place. These are pleasing results, especially with fourth place not far from the podium. We will carry this positive momentum with us to Imola.”\n\nScott Redding, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 12 / R01: 8 / SP Race: 9 / R02: 4): “Today has been pretty good. Warm up wasn’t the best for me so I thought it is going to be a hard day. The Superpole race was not bad and I finished ninth. I needed to be up there for race two. You saw the difference it makes as I had a good start. Unfortunately there was this accident, so I send my wishes to Tom and Michael. At the re–start, I got through pretty cleanly, and I do generally struggle at the start of the race to go with the front guys a little bit more. Then I thought to just keep the pressure on because I knew I come stronger. I was believing in myself to come better in the end. I had Petrucci in front and he was a bit faster so I could not get him but I got the Yamaha and I got the Kawasakis and just pushed until the end.

The bike felt so good for the first time this weekend. We’ve been playing with some different settings and finally on Sunday in the Superpole race everything felt super good. So, I was able to finish in the top nine places in seventh position. That was really positive for myself and the whole team. In race two, I got a great start after the red flag and was in fifth place. I felt so good, then I just struggled to maintain the pace. I was fighting with some arm fatigue. It wasn’t arm pump, I was just losing strength in my arm and that made it difficult to be consistent. I made a couple of stupid mistakes and people passed me, but in the end I was still with the group with Scott and the other guys. That was super positive and I’m very happy about that. We’re getting closer and closer and I know we’re going in a good direction. This is what makes me happy and I’m really excited for the next round at Imola.”\n\nLoris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 15 / R01: DNF / SP Race: 23 / R02: DNF): “Unfortunately, there is not so much to say about today. First of all, I want to send my best wishes to Tom and Michael. I hope they are ok. It was so scary! I’m just glad that I didn’t hit Tom. There was just nothing I could have done. The consequence could have been much worse. We’ve just been lacking luck all weekend with some technical issues, rain and all the problems. I couldn’t do more than six, seven laps in a row, so it was hard for me to keep the pace and I felt I was running behind. I tried to catch back the speed during the whole weekend. I’m just disappointed, as Donington is a track that I really like and I felt the BMW could do well. Garrett and Scott have shown that in race two. Now, I’m just trying to get some sleep, because I have a big headache from the crash. Now we’ll regroup and start again from Imola. Thanks to all the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team guys for the hard work again. We try harder than anyone and we will try harder next time.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport made important progress at the sixth round of the 2023 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Donington Park (GBR). Scott Redding (GBR) and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team secured a top-four finish at their home race. Garrett Gerloff (USA) and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team also showed good form. However, the positive results were overshadowed by a serious accident at the start of the second main race. Tom Sykes (GBR) crashed. Loris Baz (FRA) and Michael Ruben Rinaldi (ITA / Ducati) subsequently got involved in the incident and also went down. Sykes suffered multiple rib fractures and was taken to the hospital for further examination. Rinaldi also had to get medical treatment. Baz remained uninjured but did not participate in the restart of the second race.\n\nIn Saturday morning’s Superpole qualifying session, Sykes was the highest-placed BMW rider in eighth position. However, he had some bad luck in the closely contested session. On his second run, he was on his way to a standout lap time but was slowed by a yellow flag in the final sector. Gerloff followed in tenth place, Redding finished twelfth, and Baz ended Superpole in fifteenth position.\n\nIn the first race on Saturday afternoon, Sykes maintained a position in the top-eight until the final lap, while Redding steadily climbed up from twelfth place. Just before the finish line, Redding overtook Sykes, crossing the line in eighth position and achieving his second-best race result of the season. Sykes finished directly behind in ninth place. Unfortunately, the first race didn’t go well for the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team. Gerloff was touched by another rider in the first corner and crashed. Although he initially continued the race after a quick check in the garage, he had to retire prematurely. Baz retired due to a technical issue.\n\nThe goal in Sunday’s Superpole race was to improve on the starting positions for the second main race in the afternoon. Gerloff succeeded by working his way up to seventh place, while Redding finished ninth. Sykes was in eighth place until the penultimate lap but then crashed. He resumed the race and finished in 18th position. Baz had an early fall in the race but was also able to continue and crossed the finish line in 23rd place.\n\nAfter the restart of Sunday’s second main race, Redding initially held eighth position before steadily advancing through the field in the second half of the race. On the 19th out of a total of 22 laps, he moved up to fourth place and successfully defended it until the end. That secured his best race result of the season so far. Gerloff had a great start and held fifth position for a long time but dropped back slightly in the field to finish ninth, securing another top-ten result.\n\nThe seventh round of the WorldSBK 2023 will take place from 14th to 16th July at Imola, Italy.\n\nBMW F 900 R Cup in the WorldSBK support programme.\n\nAs part of the WorldSBK support programme, the ABK Beer 0% BMW F 900 R Cup made its appearance at Donington Park. The one-make cup, which has its debut season in 2023, offers highly competitive and cost-effective racing. The races take place during weekends of the British Superbike Championship, in addition to the WorldSBK event at Donington Park. The riders compete on identical BMW F 900 R Roadster bikes with 105 horsepower.\n\nThe third event of the season’s BMW F 900 R Cup races provided thrilling action. On Saturday, two heats of eight laps each were on the schedule. In the first race, Richard Cooper (GBR / FHO Racing BMW Motorrad) claimed victory ahead of Thomas Strudwick (GBR / Art of Racing) and Barry Burrell (GBR / Mallory Performance Racing). In the second race, Nikki Coates (GBR / Ernie Coates Track Days/AOR Racing) took the win, followed by Michael Rutter (GBR / Bathams Racing) and Christian Smith (GBR / SCH Motoprep/Smith Twins Racing). The main race over 14 laps took place on Sunday afternoon. This time, Cooper secured a clear victory, with Strudwick and Rutter completing the podium. The winner’s trophies were presented by Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad.\n\nReactions to the Donington Park round.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It was a weekend that we conclude with mixed emotions. The weekend started off difficult due to the unpredictable weather. Both practice sessions on Friday had partly wet conditions, making it challenging to prepare for the races, but that applied to everyone, of course. Even in FP3 on Saturday morning, there were damp patches on the track, and qualifying was more or less the first dry session. We were performing quite well there. Tom had the potential to put the bike on the front row in ‘Tomington’ but he was unlucky with the yellow flag. With the other guys, we didn't immediately find the right setup for the newly resurfaced track due to the lack of time in the practice sessions, however we had a stable pace with good results in the first race. Therefore, we started Sunday with confidence. Garrett also showed a good and consistent performance in the Superpole race, improving to seventh place. Tom also gave a strong performance with stable lap times but had a small slide. As a result, Scott took ninth place. We had a good pace in this race as well.\n\nThe second main race started with Tom’s terrible crash, which subsequently affected Loris and Michael Ruben Rinaldi. It has just been confirmed that Tom has multiple rib fractures. He is currently undergoing further examinations in the hospital. We wish him a speedy recovery, and at this point, as BMW Motorrad, we would also like to send our best wishes to Michael. Fortunately, Loris was relatively okay after the accident, but he had fallen on his head and decided not to participate in the restart. Garrett had a very good start but then dropped back a bit. Scott grew stronger throughout the race, ploughed through the field, and in an extremely exciting battle, especially against the Kawasakis, secured a very strong fourth place. Just under two seconds behind, Garrett crossed the finish line in ninth place. These are pleasing results, especially with fourth place not far from the podium. We will carry this positive momentum with us to Imola.”\n\nScott Redding, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 12 / R01: 8 / SP Race: 9 / R02: 4): “Today has been pretty good. Warm up wasn’t the best for me so I thought it is going to be a hard day. The Superpole race was not bad and I finished ninth. I needed to be up there for race two. You saw the difference it makes as I had a good start. Unfortunately there was this accident, so I send my wishes to Tom and Michael. At the re–start, I got through pretty cleanly, and I do generally struggle at the start of the race to go with the front guys a little bit more. Then I thought to just keep the pressure on because I knew I come stronger. I was believing in myself to come better in the end. I had Petrucci in front and he was a bit faster so I could not get him but I got the Yamaha and I got the Kawasakis and just pushed until the end. It would have been nice to have a podium but to have a ride like that after such a difficult season is great.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 10 / R01: DNF / SP Race: 7 / R02: 9): “I was really, really happy in the Superpole race.

Standing ovations after a perfect weekend were given by over 53,000 celebrating fans at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve in Portimão (POR), when reigning world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) claimed the maximum points haul at the second round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Starting from pole position, he rode the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team #1 BMW M 1000 RR to victory in all three thrilling races. Over the weekend, he secured P1 in Superpole, Race 1, the Superpole Race, and Race 2. Additionally, he set multiple new lap records. His teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) was also among the frontrunners in Portugal, finishing the races in fifth, sixth, and seventh places. From the first free practice session onwards, he impressed with an extremely consistent and strong performance.\n\nReactions after the Portimão round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This weekend in Portimão was a milestone for BMW Motorrad Motorsport – a triumph of team spirit, technology, and unwavering dedication. With his hat-trick and new lap records, Toprak impressively demonstrated the full potential of our M 1000 RR, and Michael rounded off the strong overall performance with his consistent and very strong riding. I am incredibly proud of our entire team – both on the track and in the garage. This was more than just a victory – it was a statement. Now we turn our focus forward: Assen is waiting, and we are coming with momentum!”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “It was a very intense weekend. First of all, apologies to Toprak for having to miss the first free practice on Friday due to a technical issue, but as a team, we stayed focused, worked cleanly, and were ready with both riders from FP2 onwards. I think you could see in almost every session that both performed well. Lap records, pole position, three wins for Toprak, and Mickey consistently in the top positions – it has been a very strong weekend for BMW. It was great to be back in Europe and to see on this track layout that our 2025 bike package is working very well. That means what was discussed in the past is in the past, and we can now focus on the present. With many dry sessions both during testing and the race weekend, we had the opportunity to perfect and fine-tune the bike. The engineers, mechanics, and riders got the absolute maximum out of the bike, and the package is competitive. Now we’re looking forward to Assen.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We have been pushing really hard this weekend, in every corner. A big thank you to the team, everyone is working really hard and we improved the bike in every session. Congrats also to Nicolò Bulega, he did a great job this weekend, he is really strong. I am really happy; we were fighting with Nicolò here and I think everybody enjoyed to watch the races. I am a fighter, I love to fight and I never give up. The bike is not 100 per cent yet, but I was only pushing for the win. Yesterday’s race was harder for me because I often lost the front. I just tried to follow Nicolò and to win the race. It has been a good battle. In today’s races, the pace was incredible and I was pushing really hard, but I felt a little bit better because we had improved the bike and I felt more grip. I came here with the target to get pole and three wins. We achieved all of that and for me, it has been an incredible weekend. After Phillip Island, we came back and have been really strong here. Now we will see how the next races will be.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had a good weekend. We were pretty fast on Friday so we were really happy with how we started the weekend. In Superpole I was happy, I made some small mistakes and qualified seventh. I did not want to be there but it was not bad. In race one, I just had no feeling with the bike. I struggled a lot and it was just a long race but I finished sixth so that wasn’t too bad but I just did not enjoy it. For today, we made some changes and in the Superpole Race, I was a bit unlucky. I wasn’t precise on the first lap so I lost a couple of places. Then I fought my way back to P7 which was okay coming from where I was after lap one. In race two, I had a good start, a good rhythm. I was just not fast enough to fight for the podium but overall, it has been a good end of the weekend.”\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 26°, humidity: 37%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* new all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 25°, track temperature: 37°, humidity: 35%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 4, 1:40.351\n\nAir temperature: 21°, track temperature: 25°, humidity: 39%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:39.441 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 36°, humidity: 27%, conditions: dry, laps: 11 after red flag.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 5, 1:39.614\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R02/12, after 6 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R02/12, after 6 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Standing ovations after a perfect weekend were given by over 53,000 celebrating fans at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve in Portimão (POR), when reigning world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) claimed the maximum points haul at the second round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK).

This makes it possible to perform efficient virtual simulation of many variants in the complex system of luge and athlete, to identify and make even the smallest adjustments.\n\nEvery detail counts, especially in luging – ultimately, this is a sport in which the time is displayed in thousandths of a second at the finish line."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

BMW M Team WRT competed its first race in the 2023 Intercontinental GT Challenge, the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS). The endurance classic also marked the first official outing of the team together with BMW M Motorsport. After twelve hours of racing, held in sunny summer weather, the #32 Shell BMW M4 GT3 took the chequered flag in fourth position. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL) and Charles Weerts (BEL) shared duties in the car. The #46 BMW M4 GT3, driven by Augusto Farfus (BRA), Maxime Martin (BEL) and Valentino Rossi (ITA), crossed the line in sixth place.\n\nWhile Farfus, Martin and Vanthoor knew Mount Panorama Circuit already, Bathurst rookies Rossi, van der Linde and Weerts first had to get acquainted with the extremely tricky and partly very tight rollercoaster circuit. They mastered the challenge brilliantly and all three quickly found their rhythm.\n\nSunday morning at 5:45 local time, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 started the race from sixth position; the #32 was ninth on the grid. After eventful first hours of racing in which accidents caused several safety car periods, BMW M Team WRT was temporarily running within the top three but both cars lost positions again as the race went on. With two and a half hours to go, the #46 car needed to head to the garage for a quick repair due to a small issue with the brake light.\n\nRound two of the 2023 Intercontinental GT Challenge will be held in three weeks’ time, the Kyalami 9 Hour in South Africa from 23rd to 25th February. There, Valentino Rossi will be replaced by BMW M works driver Philipp Eng (AUT).\n\nThe BMW M Motorsport IGTC project is supported by strong partners. Oils produced by Shell, Premium Technology Partner of BMW M Motorsport, are used for the complete powertrain in both BMW M4 GT3s. Part of the project are also Endless as Official Partner of BMW M Motorsport and the KW suspension experts as Official Supplier of BMW M Motorsport.\n\nReactions after the Bathurst 12 Hour.\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The Bathurst 12 Hour is always a fantastic event, and that was the case this year when we returned to Mount Panorama. A unique circuit and many passionate fans – that has been great. From a sporting point of view, the result has been disappointing in the end after all drivers and the entire team did a faultless job. Unfortunately we have not been competitive enough to fight for the podium and so the great effort has not been rewarded with the corresponding results. We take the positives: we brought both cars to the finish and we gelled well with BMW M Team WRT in our first official race together. The BMW M4 GT3 once more proved to be very reliable; we just had one minor technical issue with the #46 car. A big thank you to the drivers, to BMW M Team WRT and everybody involved at BMW M Motorsport for the superb job. Now we continue to work and prepare for the next race at Kyalami.”\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal BMW M Team WRT: “We had a disappointing result. Obviously we did not have the tools to fight for anything better. This is an incredible event, an incredible track and it’s a pleasure to be here, but in these circumstances it is a bit difficult. There is a very positive point and that’s the line-ups. All six drivers have done an outstanding job. They made no mistakes at all, they all had a similar speed. We also need to mention what Vale did; that was on a very high level for his first attempt at Bathurst. It was also really a pleasure to have Augusto in the team for the first time, and great to have Sheldon back with us after a few years. Now we are looking forward to Kyalami.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#32 Shell BMW M4 GT3, 4th place): “It’s honestly my favourite track on the calendar now, that’s for sure. I really had high hopes coming here and my expectations raised even higher when I drove the track for the first time so I am really thankful to BMW M Team WRT and BMW M Motorsport for giving me this chance to finally come to Bathurst. I already want to come back next year because I feel we have unfinished business. Unfortunately the race did not go as we kind of planned but we will have another chance in the future.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#32 Shell BMW M4 GT3, 4th place): “It’s not the result we would have hoped for and we came for but everybody did a great job. Team, BMW M Motorsport, car, drivers – nobody made any mistakes. It was just the maximum we could do this time. I think you can say that we are the best of the rest. I hope that at the next rounds we will be capable of fighting with the other cars because at the moment we can’t. What we can do is to continue to work on the car and on ourselves but everybody did a great job.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 Shell BMW M4 GT3, 4th place): “It has been my firsttime at Bathurst and my first race with BMW M Motorsport, so I am happy that the car is still in one piece. That was obviously the first goal. Fourth place is nothing dramatic but obviously we came here to Australia aiming a bit higher but the Mercedes have been way too fast for us and we could not do anything more. The strategy was good, the start was good, the car was good and we executed the job like we had to do it. We can be happy about our job and now we move on to the next one.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 6th place): “My first Bathurst experience has been very good because it’s a great place. For us Europeans, it is a legendary place because we always play it on the simulator. To have the chance to race here and experience the real track is great. It is a fantastic circuit. You have to maintain attention but it is very enjoyable when you drive. I think that also my speed and performance were good. I feel good in the car; it is very good to drive, but during the race, especially in the hot conditions, we need a bit more pace. We could have been in the top five but overall it was a good race, and being the first experience, it was very positive.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 6th place): “I am very happy. It was the first experience with BMW M Team WRT and it was great. Unfortunately we have not been rewarded with a better result. Vale did an incredible job as the whole team did. I think we have a great base to build on so I can’t wait to go to Kyalami soon. Thanks to BMW M Motorsport, to the team and my team-mates – everyone has done an incredible job.”\n\nMaxime Martin (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 6th place): “We had a good start to the race. We have always been in a good pack and with the safety cars and so on we were running quite okay in the morning, but then we definitely lacked a lot of pace and we could not fight anyone. We also had a small issue. We were hoping for more than P6 but I think we can improve and am looking forward to the next one.”\n\nOn Friday, a media round table with the six BMW M works drivers was held at Bathurst.

With 28.5 points, the 45-year-old Spaniard is the most successful player in the history of the legendary team competition, while the 34-year-old American earned himself the nickname ‘Captain America’ as the emotive leader of Team USA. Reed’s singles match against Rory McIlroy (NIR) at the 2016 Ryder Cup in Hazeltine (USA) is unforgettable and is regarded as the best one ever played in the competition to date.\n\nGarcía last teed off at the BMW International Open in 2022. Despite an extremely successful career with 16 titles on the DP World Tour and eleven wins on the PGA TOUR, he is yet to win in Munich. He has finished second twice (2011 and 2017) and, together with Pablo Larrazábal, became one of the sporting highlights of the tournament's 36-year history in 2011. Over five extra holes, the two Spaniards went head-to-head in a play-off that was both dramatic and top class, and one that those who had the privilege of witnessing live will no doubt never forget.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to returning to the BMW International Open. This tournament and the golf fans, who have always given me their whole-hearted support there, have always meant a great deal to me,” said García. “I love Munich and am looking forward to competing with a first-class international field, particularly the top German players.”\n\nReed made his debut at the BMW International Open last year and finished in joint 13thplace. After three rounds the Texan was just two shots behind the leader but was unable to exploit that good starting point on the final Sunday. However, Reed still has very fond memories of the week in Munich.\n\n“I am so excited to announce that I will be back in Munich this summer to tee it up in the 2025 BMW International Open. I played in the historic BMW International for the first time last year, and we had such a great time – the competitive spirit and atmosphere, the Bavarian culture, and crowd makes for such a great event!

At this year's Web Summit in Lisbon, the BMW Group is presenting a mix of real driving and a virtual environment for the first time. ///M Mixed Reality is the name of the extraordinary experience. Integrated gaming elements for a unique BMW M driving experienceThe unique mixed reality1 approach, which a team of BMW M engineers developed together with Epic Games for the BMW M2, allows drivers and their vehicles to immerse themselves in a virtual world. People need to be able to experience the new feeling of driving a BMW with VR/MR glasses while mastering challenges at high speeds as in a racing game. Integrated gaming elements, such as avoiding obstacles, collecting virtual “coins,” etc., reinforce the immersive in-car experience. True to the motto: Drive the Change, Change the Drive. The system takes all movement and rotary axes of the BMW M2 into account. The vehicle itself becomes the controller, in this case the fastest controller in the world. “Anyone who asks what virtual experiences in the automotive sector might look like in future: That is the answer.

With ///M Mixed Reality, the BMW Group is bringing technology to the high-profile driving sector, consistently relying on the principle of human centricity, in which the use of innovative technologies is driven by people's wishes and needs. As part of this approach, the BMW Group laid the foundation for ConnectedDrive more than 20 years ago by installing modern communication technology in vehicles. “At BMW M, we have always been testing the limits of what is technically feasible and thus, among other things, laying the foundation for new immersive experiences,” says Frank van Meel.\n\nA first insight can be found here (Link to the video).\n\nThe BMW Group is already using mixed reality technologies in many forms of application, merging real and digital worlds more and more. These include Augmented Reality 2 applications, cross-team development of vehicles, Virtual Reality 3 solutions for production planning and the iFactory Lydia.

At this year's Web Summit in Lisbon, the BMW Group is presenting a mix of real driving and a virtual environment for the first time. ///M Mixed Reality is the name of the extraordinary experience. Integrated gaming elements for a unique BMW M driving experienceThe unique mixed reality1 approach, which a team of BMW M engineers developed together with Epic Games for the BMW M2, allows drivers and their vehicles to immerse themselves in a virtual world. People need to be able to experience the new feeling of driving a BMW with VR/MR glasses while mastering challenges at high speeds as in a racing game. Integrated gaming elements, such as avoiding obstacles, collecting virtual “coins,” etc., reinforce the immersive in-car experience. True to the motto: Drive the Change, Change the Drive. The system takes all movement and rotary axes of the BMW M2 into account. The vehicle itself becomes the controller, in this case the fastest controller in the world. “Anyone who asks what virtual experiences in the automotive sector might look like in future: That is the answer. People must be able to experience this new feeling — and with ///M Mixed Reality, we offer them a suitable solution for this,” says Frank van Meel, CEO M GmbH. With ///M Mixed Reality, the BMW Group is bringing technology to the high-profile driving sector, consistently relying on the principle of human centricity, in which the use of innovative technologies is driven by people's wishes and needs. As part of this approach, the BMW Group laid the foundation for ConnectedDrive more than 20 years ago by installing modern communication technology in vehicles. “At BMW M, we have always been testing the limits of what is technically feasible and thus, among other things, laying the foundation for new immersive experiences,” says Frank van Meel.\n\nA first insight can be found here (Link to the video).\n\nThe BMW Group is already using mixed reality technologies in many forms of application, merging real and digital worlds more and more. These include Augmented Reality 2 applications, cross-team development of vehicles, Virtual Reality 3 solutions for production planning and the iFactory Lydia. Using the powerful gaming engine from Epic Games (Unreal Engine), this became the BMW Group's first factory, which was completely planned and simulated in a virtual environment. By the beginning of next year, the BMW Group will also digitize all production sites using 3D laser scans. 1 Mixed Reality: Mixed Reality (MR), Mixed Reality or Mixed Reality comprises environments or systems that mix natural and artificial perception. 2 Augmented Reality (AR) describes the computer-aided extension of reality perception. 3 Virtual Reality (VR) is the representation and simultaneous perception of an apparent reality and its physical properties in a real-time computer-generated, interactive virtual environment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

At the penultimate race weekend of the DTM season at the Red Bull Ring (AUT), the BMW M4 GT3 returned to the winner's circle. René Rast (GER) celebrated his first victory as a BMW M works driver with a first-place finish in Sunday's race. Prior to that, he broke Bernd Schneider's (GER) DTM record with his second pole position of the season. With a total of 26 poles, Rast is now the sole leader in the all-time best list. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) secured second place on Sunday, contributing to a 1-2 for Team Schubert Motorsport. Marco Wittmann (GER) matched his best season result as he finished fourth on Sunday, narrowly missing out on his first podium with the Project 1 Team.\n\nAfter a mixed Saturday race at Spielberg, where Rast narrowly missed the podium in fourth place and Wittmann and van der Linde finished eighth and 13th, the three BMW M works drivers bounced back on Sunday. Rast secured pole position with a lead of 0.111 seconds over his teammate van der Linde, while Wittmann started from fifth. In the race, the Schubert duo defended the first two positions to the finish line, while Wittmann battled for third place but ultimately settled for fourth. He had achieved the same result at Zandvoort (NED). Sandro Holzem (GER) finished 24th in the second Project 1 BMW M4 GT3 on Saturday and retired on Sunday.\n\nHeading into the season finale in October at Hockenheim (GER), van der Linde and Rast are currently in fourth and fifth place in the driver's standings. In the team standings, Schubert Motorsport is in fourth place.\n\nReactions after the DTM weekend at the Red Bull Ring:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to René Rast, Schubert Motorsport, and everyone involved with BMW M Motorsport on this fantastic result! I especially congratulate René on his first victory as a BMW M works driver and the pole record. The second place for Sheldon van der Linde and the fourth place for Marco Wittmann and Project 1, who came very close to securing a triple victory, were fantastic performances as well. Thanks to everyone for their hard work! After the disappointing results in the recent DTM weekends, this success feels great, and everyone deserves it. Now, we'll celebrate. After that, we'll give our all to finishing the season on a high note at Hockenheim.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “My first win with BMW M Motorsport feels very special. The team did a superb job, the pit stop was excellent, and the guys simply deserved it today. It's an incredible day, and hopefully, it will continue this way. I'm hopping into the car now to go home, and maybe I'll get my third gift after the pole and the win when my second child is born.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “I'm proud of my race on Sunday, especially for coming back after the weak Saturday race. I tried to pass René in the first corners, but it wasn't quite enough. After that, he made no mistakes. Congratulations to him on his first win with BMW M Motorsport! Unfortunately, my DTM title defense is almost impossible after this weekend. That's a shame, but you can't win all the time. My goal now is to challenge for third place in the driver's standings at Hockenheim.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 BMW M4 GT3, Project 1): “P8 and P4 are good results, but I had hoped for even more considering that the Red Bull Ring plays to the strengths of the BMW M4 GT3. Schubert Motorsport proved that with the double victory on Sunday – congratulations to the team and the drivers! My race pace was similarly strong, but unfortunately, a pit stop that was about three seconds longer cost us the chance of a podium finish. Anything more than fourth place was not possible after that.

The star of the video is an octopus performing a perfectly coordinated underwater choreography – as an analogy for the way the Heart of Joy will intelligently coordinate key driving functions in future BMW vehicles, starting with the Neue Klasse models. Munich. A new central control unit called the Heart of Joy is taking BMW driving dynamics to a new level – from standstill to the limits. It will make its debut in the BMW Neue Klasse models. The Heart of Joy combines with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack to centrally control the powertrain, brakes and recuperation as well as some steering functions. Compared to previous systems, the new control unit processes driving information around ten times faster and responds more directly to the driver than ever before. The Heart of Joy passed its first public performance test at Auto Shanghai, as part of the BMW Vision Driving Experience.\n\nThe “Meet Okto the Octopus” video translates the new “superbrain’s” power into cinematic poetry. The star of the video is an octopus. A fascinating animal that uses a decentralised nervous system to enable independent control of individual parts of its body. Much like a modern car has separate control units for braking, acceleration and steering. In the new BMW brand video, this scenario is reversed: the octopus is given a central nervous system and then moves in a synchronised, precise and controlled manner to perform an underwater waltz – while simultaneously avoiding hazards.\n\nThe video’s concept and implementation are the work of the Jung von Matt Hamburg agency. The video will be shown online and in cinemas worldwide.

The breakthrough has been achieved. BMW M Team RLL has secured the first victory of the season for the BMW M Hybrid V8 – and what a victory it was! In the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) race at Road America (USA), Philipp Eng (AUT) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) triumphed in the #24 car. Their teammates in the #25 car, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER), completed the one-two finish by securing second place. After four pole positions and two podium finishes earlier in the season, the joy over the first win was immense. There was also great celebration at Paul Miller Racing as Neil Verhagen and Madison Snow (both USA) claimed victory in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GTD PRO class .\n\nThe two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL started the race from second and third on the grid after strong lap times in qualifying. Over the course of the 2:40-hour race, both crews experienced a rollercoaster of emotions. Initially, both cars dropped to the back of the GTP field due to an incident during a pit stop. An RLL mechanic was lightly injured after being struck by another prototype which extended the pit stop times. However, with an hour remaining, the team decided to bring both cars in early for their final refuelling stop, aiming to gain a strategic advantage during one of the race's many yellow flag periods. This strategy paid off, and after the final race neutralisation, closing drivers Eng and Wittmann led the race. They maintained this one-two lead even amidst heavy traffic with lapped cars. Following four pole positions at the start of the season and podium finishes at Long Beach and Laguna Seca (both USA), the first victory of the season for the BMW M Hybrid V8 marked a significant breakthrough.\n\nPaul Miller Racing added another reason to celebrate on this highly successful day for BMW M Motorsport. Neil Verhagen and Madison Snow (both USA) claimed victory in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GTD PRO category. It was the first win of the season for the driver duo and the second for the team, following the triumph of Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) at Watkins Glen (USA). This time, Harper and Hesse finished seventh in the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO after some intense battles in a chaotic race. Turner Motorsport narrowly missed the podium in the GTD class, with Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) finishing fourth in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"What a fantastic IMSA race at Road America! Congratulations to BMW M Team RLL, Philipp Eng, and Dries Vanthoor on their first victory of the season with our BMW M Hybrid V8. Both have delivered outstanding performances, especially at the start of the season, but were unable to convert them into a win until now. Finally, it has worked out, and the hard work of everyone involved has paid off. I am equally thrilled for Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann, who made it onto the podium for the first time this season. We are clearly moving in the right direction with our Hypercar project, and it’s great to see this reflected in the results. Another heartfelt congratulations to Paul Miller Racing for their second win of the season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. This triumph not only underscores the strength of our GT3 car worldwide but also makes an already incredible race day even better. Thank you to everyone!\"\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 1st place): \"A fantastic day for the entire team. A flawless job. Thankfully, nothing more serious happened during the pit lane incident, and I’m very glad our mechanic is okay. Beyond that, it was simply a strategic masterpiece by the entire team, and the car’s balance was extremely strong. We were strong in clean air, strong in traffic, and positioned ourselves very well. In the end, it was all about making no mistakes and controlling the race. Thankfully, we managed to do that. It was an incredibly strong team effort. Every single person on the team can be extremely proud of themselves.\"\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 1st place): \"This is a fantastic result for BMW M Motorsport with the one-two finish in the GTP class and the victory in the GTD PRO class. Our weekend started well, and this time we finally managed to turn it into a win after struggling earlier in the season to fully capitalise on our speed. The team was amazing, and the strategy call was perfect. In the end, we had enough speed to bring home first place. Philipp did an excellent job. Now we’ll keep pushing and hopefully finish the season with more strong results.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 2nd place): \"A great result for us as BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team RLL. It’s a bit of a relief after the last few races, where we were strong in qualifying but couldn’t deliver in the race. This time, everything worked out well. Ultimately, a good strategy brought us forward, but we also showed strong pace during the race. The team success with the one-two finish is, of course, fantastic. We’re super happy. I think it’s a relief for everyone on the team.

In addition to its emission-free electric drive, the BMW Motorrad Vision CE's standout features include the elimination of the need for a helmet as well as protective clothing, offering riders an increased sense of freedom and a casual, carefree riding experience. Setting new standards, the Vision CE offers an emotional, creative and fresh take on commuting, describing the future of urban two-wheel mobility.\n\nIn line with the BMW Group's sustainability strategy, BMW Motorrad is committed to rethinking urban electromobility constantly - making it emission-free, innovative and featuring ground-breaking designs. Back in 2014, BMW Motorrad became the first premium manufacturer to combine outstanding design with an electric drive in the BMW C evolution. The BMW CE 04, a design and technology masterpiece of emission-free urban mobility, was finally launched on the market in 2022. To this day, the CE 04 is the global market leader in its segment. Another highlight followed in 2024 with the BMW CE 02, which is also electric and symbolises a completely new style of mobility that is unique and extremely casual.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, BMW Motorrad revolutionised urban mobility with the BMW C1, a scooter that, thanks to its sophisticated safety bodywork, made it possible to dispense with helmets and the usual protective clothing. The BMW Motorrad Vision CE builds on this fundamental design philosophy, presenting it in a new interpretation with an emotional design language to create a unique, forward-looking vision vehicle.\n\nThe centrepiece of the BMW Motorrad Vision CE is its safety concept: a metal tube composite known as the 'cage'. Together with an appropriate seat construction with seat belt, it ensures a safe and emotional riding experience without the need for a helmet or the usual protective clothing.\n\nThe cage's reduced overall height and open, airy design, combined with a long wheelbase, give the Vision CE a stretched, dynamic and visually light appearance. The open use of coated aluminium adds an exclusive technical touch. The combination of the basic colour matt white and the contrasting colour black gives the Vision CE a clear, reduced and sculptural appearance. This innovative design and colour scheme is complemented by an elegant matt seat bench with integrated lettering and neon red accents on the graphics and other highlighted details.\n\nAnother highlight of the Vision CE is its balancing function, which allows the vehicle to completely balance itself when stationary.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad Vision CE redefines urban riding fun on two wheels, thanks to its unique cage design that eliminates the need for a helmet or protective clothing.

As part of a racing weekend organized by Dener Motorsports at the former Formula 1 circuit “Circuito Estoril” near Lisbon/Portugal, a tribute event for the three-time Formula 1 world champion took place on the last weekend in August. The participation of BMW Group Classic occurred in close cooperation with Dener Pires, a close friend of Nelson Piquet.\n\nBMW Group Classic brought two of Nelson Piquet's legendary racing cars to the event. A Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo, in which he became the first turbo world champion in Formula 1 in 1983, and a BMW M1 Procar, in which he became BMW Procar champion in 1980.\n\nNelson Piquet grabbed the steering wheel on two days, first completing a shake-down in both cars and then doing a few laps of honour in the Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo the following day.

In addition, there were around 7,000 kilometres during the 15 Formula 1 race weekends, including the training and qualifying sessions. We had a racing team, a Brabham test team and a BMW test team. We drove a lot. Back then, it was perhaps more personal and more like a family within the team.\n\nWhat was decisive for the Formula 1 world championship title in 1983?\n\nThe BMW turbo engine, although it was developed later than the competition. We developed the car and the engine in 1982 and won the championship in 1983. That was fantastic.\n\nBMW also used telemetry data transmission systems for the first time. These were not intended for driving or tuning the car, but only for the engine. But they were still very helpful.\n\nWe were able to solve technical problems quickly. For example, we had problems with fuel consumption that could be solved immediately after the race weekend during test drives. And we also had an extremely strong gearbox.\n\nHow difficult was it to handle the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo with its enormous power?\n\nBack then, it was normal to deal with the power.

The new MINI family all-electric models get sound worlds distinctive to the brand for an even more immersive driving experience. The repertoire includes completely new driving sounds in the interior, an unmistakable brand sound to distinguish it as a MINI in the exterior, jingles for the new MINI Experience Modes as well as new sound icons for information and warning functions.\n\n„The new sounds are an integral part of the digital experience and individually tailored to the character of each of the new models. They make an emotive appeal to the passengers in the interior while shaping the acoustic perception to the outside world. They also make it sound as well as look as unmistakably a MINI,” says Oliver Heilmer, Head of MINI Design. These can be experienced for the first time in the new MINI Cooper Electric.\n\nThe new MINI Sound DNA is based on the essential brand values and exudes a positive, charismatic aura. The MINI Experience Modes become the stage for the completely newly created sound worlds. Analogue instruments, digital technology and artificial intelligence combine to generate sounds that simultaneously define it as MINI, convey information and arouse emotions.\n\nFour driving sounds for an individual user experience. The MINI “Core”, “Go Kart”, “Timeless” and “Balance” Experience Modes feature individually curated driving sounds that acoustically feed back to the driver during acceleration. These sounds are audible in the interior of the future MINI models, emotionalising the driving experience and also conveying an authentic yet informative impression of the driving situation.\n\nThe default sound world for the new MINI model family will be the “Core” driving sound. It is the only sound mode that is not only heard inside the vehicle, but outside it as well, as acoustic pedestrian protection. As a MINI brand sound, it sounds inviting, energetic and inspiring. “The new sound design for MINI is inspired by Nicolaus Copernicus, who depicts the heliocentric view of the world in which the planets revolve around the sun,” says Renzo Vitale, Creative Director Sound at the BMW Group. “We drew inspiration from the round shape of the OLED central display for the ‘Core’ driving sound. It reminds us of the sun radiating warmth. In an analogy to the planets, which each reflect the sunlight in their own way, we designed different sound components that vary depending on the driving situation.”\n\nThe MINI “Go Kart” driving sound was created for a particularly sporty driving experience. This features strongly pronounced pitch and load curves, forming a fitting sound backdrop for agile and dynamic driving.\n\nTradition and progress come together in the MINI “Timeless” driving sound. The engine sounds of conventionally powered models from the classic Mini to the MINI John Cooper Works GP were sampled and combined with a futuristic interpretation of the MINI “Core” driving sound to create an acoustic journey through time. The more intensively the vehicle accelerates, the more the sound morphs from the internal combustion engine past to the purely electric present.\n\nA fourth soundscape opens up with the MINI “Balance” driving sound. It was originally designed for the MINI Vision Urbanaut and is based on the sounds experienced in a forest at different times of the day and night: from the babbling of a stream to the chirping of crickets and the rustling of the wind in the treetops. The resulting worlds of sound give a sense of relaxation and well-being on board the future MINI models.\n\nCharacteristic jingles and striking earcons. The driving sounds for the future MINI family are assigned to the equally new Experience Modes. Their activation is announced with a characteristic jingle. This short sound sequence gets the occupants in the mood for the change to a new vehicle setting.\n\nAnother component of the completely new sound worlds for the new MINI family are known as earcons.

In scorching heat and in front of more than 100,000 enthusiastic fans, Schubert Motorsport achieved great success during the third DTM race weekend of the season at the Norisring in Nürnberg (GER). On Saturday, the reigning DTM champion Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) secured his first victory of the year from pole position, with René Rast (GER) completing a Schubert one-two finish in second place. On Sunday, despite success ballast, both BMW M4 GT3 cars from the team made it to the podium. Rast claimed pole position this time and finished second in the race again, while van der Linde took third place. Marco Wittmann (GER) was celebrated by the fans at his home event and finished ninth and 13th in the Project 1 #11 BMW M4 GT3.\n\nIn the driver standings, van der Linde is in second place with 78 points after his successes in Nürnberg, trailing behind Sunday's race winner, Thomas Preining (AUT / Porsche). Rast is seventh with 54 points, despite missing the race weekend at Zandvoort (NED) due to a scheduling conflict. Wittmann is currently in eleventh position with 35 points. In the team standings, Schubert Motorsport is only one point behind Manthey EMA in second place. In the manufacturer standings, BMW is also in second place with 157 points, trailing behind Porsche.\n\nWittmann, as the local hero, was celebrated by his home fans in the grandstand. Before each race, the two-time DTM champion took the time to visit his supporters in the stands and express his gratitude for their support.\n\nReactions to the DTM weekend at the Norisring:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"A fantastic weekend for us here at the Norisring! In the DTM, we achieved four out of six possible podium finishes. The BMW M4 GT3 showed what it's capable of on this track. Everyone at BMW M Motorsport can be proud of that. Sheldon van der Linde and René Rast’s results are also great for the championship standings. Many thanks to Schubert Motorsport for their excellent work! Unfortunately, things didn't go optimally for Marco Wittmann and Project 1. He had bad luck in qualifying on Saturday but managed to fight his way forward in a strong race. On Sunday, qualifying was better, but he couldn't make progress in the race. So, we still have some homework to do in terms of the rest of the season, but I'm confident that we'll soon see Marco return to the front. Finally, a big compliment to the organiser and the fans for yet another great event here in Nürnberg.\"\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): \"I'm super happy about this weekend, which I never expected beforehand. To be on the podium twice at the Norisring, where I've never done well before, is fantastic. Of course, first place on Saturday was an absolute highlight, but the third place on Sunday feels like a victory to me. I didn't think I could defend the podium spot despite my success ballast. Now, I've achieved three podiums in the last four races and made a big leap in the championship. I would like to carry this momentum into the next DTM race weekends.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): \"It was a very good weekend for me personally and for the whole team. If someone had offered me two second-places and a pole position beforehand, I would have signed immediately. I collected a lot of points, which is always the most important thing in the DTM. However, on Sunday, I would have liked to win from pole position, but in the second half of the race, we simply didn't have the necessary pace anymore. Thomas Preining's overtaking manoeuvre was, from my perspective, very tough and surprised me at that moment. After that, my car had slight damage, and I couldn't follow him anymore. Ultimately, I think we extracted the maximum from this weekend.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 BMW M4 GT3, Project 1): \"From a sporting perspective, it was a tough weekend. We simply couldn't find the pace to keep up with the frontrunners. It's evident that, as a new team, we still need to find our footing, and that takes time. However, the absolute highlight was the incredible atmosphere at my home event and ten-year DTM anniversary here at the Norisring.

Until today, the BMW CE 04 remains the undisputed market leader in the segment of all-electric motorcycles and scooters with an output of over 11 kW. The premium scooter has been specifically revised for this segment.\n\nThe Basic variant features Lightwhite uni body colour combined with a black-grey seat and clear windshield, giving the new BMW CE 04 a clean and consistent look.\n\nThe Avantgarde variant in the body colour Gravity blue metallic matt, combined with the contrasting colour Sao Paulo yellow, highlights the CE 04's dynamic and forward-thinking design. The Pro seat in black/light grey with yellow and white tapes, a yellow-tinted windshield, and a laser-engraved rear wheel rim complete the design.\n\nThe Exclusive variant features the Spacesilver metallic body colour combined with exclusive tapes, giving the CE 04 an especially elegant look. This version of the CE 04 also features increased wind and weather protection in the form of a large windshield with integrated hand protectors and heated grips. It also has a laser-engraved rear wheel rim on one side, a comfort seat with seat heating, new upholstery fabric and CE 04 embroidery.\n\nIncreased wind and weather protection in the form of a large windshield with integrated hand protectors, as well as a comfort seat with seat heating, are also available as optional equipment ex works for the other model variants. The new laser-engraved rear wheel rims on one side are reserved for the Avantgarde and Exclusive variants.\n\nThe optional equipment range for the new BMW CE 04 comprises the following:\n\nThe BMW CE 04 - the electric champion for the city. Like no other, it combines the latest electromobility technologies with emotion and great riding pleasure.\n\nManufactured at the BMW Group plant in Berlin, the birthplace of BMW motorcycles, the BMW CE 04 is packed with innovative technologies, particularly in terms of its drive and control systems, for which the BMW Group has filed several patent applications. With its electric drive, forward-looking design and innovative connectivity solutions, this scooter merges transport and communication functions and promises a great riding experience.\n\nPlenty of power and ample range for supreme riding in the city and in urban areas.\n\nWith a maximum output of 31 kW (42 hp), the BMW CE 04 has a powerful motor and offers outstanding riding pleasure. For the classic “traffic light start” discipline from 0 to 50 km/h, it takes just fast 2.6 seconds. Even in the reduced output L3e-A1 vehicle class, 23 kW (31 hp) drive power is available. The maximum speed of both versions is 120 km/h – for speedy progress not just in the city but on main roads and motorway sections, too.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 has an ample battery cell capacity of 60.6 Ah (8.9 kWh), providing a range of some 130 kilometres (reduced output version: 100 km). This enables day-to-day emission-free riding in the city, in an urban setting and for smaller-scale fun tours after work or at the weekend – with complete peace of mind.\n\nInnovative electric drive with liquid-cooled electric motor.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 has a permanent magnet electric motor mounted in the frame between the battery and the rear wheel, as used in a similar form in BMW cars such as the 225xe Active Tourer. BMW Motorrad conducted extensive riding tests to develop a specific type of recuperation for each riding mode, giving the rider a high-level convenience. This means that optimum performance and riding characteristics are available in every situation on the road.\n\nShort charging times and charging technology based on the system used in cars.\n\nThe lithium-ion battery is charged using the integrated charging device either at a regular household socket, a wallbox or a public charging station. When the battery is completely flat, charging time ideally lasts 4 hours and 20 minutes. With the quick charger available as an optional extra with an output of up to 6.9 kW (2.3 kW is the standard level), charging time is reduced to just 1 hour and 40 minutes when the battery is completely flat. If the battery level is only 20 per cent and the battery is charged to 80 per cent, the charging time is reduced to just 45 minutes with the optional quick charger. Depending on the market, the standard charging cable with a charging capacity of 2.3 kW comes as standard with the BMW CE 04.\n\nA Mode 3 charging cable is required for fast charging at the wallbox at home or at a public charging station. In the same way as with BMW automobiles, BMW Charging solutions are available for the BMW CE 04, too – for maximum flexibility based on numerous customised programmes for charging at home, on the road and at work.\n\nIncreased riding stability through slip control by means of ASC (Automatic Stability Control). DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) as an ex works option.\n\nSimilar to the ASC system found on BMW motorcycles with combustion engines, this traction control system is also available on the BMW CE 04. ASC limits the engine torque depending on the rear wheel slip. DTC, which is available as an option, provides even greater riding safety. DTC enables even more efficient and safe acceleration, especially in banking position.\n\nThree riding modes \"ECO\", \"RAIN\" and \"ROAD\" for efficient, everyday use as standard. “DYNAMIC” riding mode for further enhanced riding pleasure as an ex works option.\n\nIn developing the BMW CE 04, BMW Motorrad attached particular importance to providing opportunities for the rider to make an individual choice between maximum efficiency and maximum riding fun. Accordingly, the new BMW CE 04 features the three riding modes “ECO”, “RAIN” and “ROAD” as standard. The additional “DYNAMIC” riding mode is also available as an ex works option, enabling the scooter to accelerate at an even swifter pace.\n\nDirectionally stable suspension with one-piece tubular steel main frame for smooth handling and a high level of ride comfort.\n\nThe main frame is a tubular steel construction. The front wheel is controlled by a telescopic fork with a slider tube diameter of 35 mm. Rear wheel control consists of a single-sided swing arm. At the rear, suspension and damping are performed by a directly controlled, fully covered spring strut. The BMW CE 04 is fitted with generously sized tyres, with 120/70 R15 67H at the front and 160/60 R15 56H at the rear.\n\nPowerful brake system with latest-generation ABS. ABS Pro with banking capability as an ex works option.\n\nAt the front, a twin disc brake ensures secure deceleration, supported by a single-disc system at the rear. In addition, BMW Motorrad ABS ensures a high level of active safety. ABS Pro, available as an optional extra, goes even further: By means of a banking sensor, ABS Pro also controls braking on bends, thereby offering the greatest possible safety.\n\n10.25” TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation for convenient route planning and extensive connectivity as standard.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 comes fitted as standard with a 10.25-inch TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation and connectivity. Its excellent readability, clear menu navigation and highly integrated operating concept put the BMW CE 04 at the top of the scooter segment. For the first time, the new 10.25-inch colour screen makes it possible to display a navigation map in the instrument cluster, so no additional display is needed.\n\nPowerful LED lighting units all round. Adaptive Headlight Pro and light functions as ex works options.\n\nThe lighting units on the BMW CE 04 are based on state-of-the-art LED technology. They include a headlamp for high beam and low beam at the front. In addition to a rear light featuring LED technology, there are also LED turn indicators. The indicator lamps likewise use LED technology. Even greater safety at night is offered by the adaptive turning light Headlight Pro, available as an ex works option. Here, the rider benefits from further improved illumination of the road when cornering for even safer riding at night. Special light functions such as “Welcome” and “Good Bye” are also available as ex works options.\n\nFuture-oriented design and colour scheme.\n\nThe BMW CE 04's design embodies a forward-looking form of urban two-wheel mobility and uses an innovative design language that evokes emotion for this drive technology, immediately identifying it as part of the BMW Motorrad family. The modern surface treatment is impressively presented in Lightwhite non-metallic and is complemented by matt black sections in the front and side areas, as well as the “floating” seat. There are also pioneering wheels designed to look like disc wheels (solid wheels) and a side stand integrated into the design.\n\nThe highlights of the BMW CE 04:\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The new BMW CE 04 - the electric premium scooter in fresh colours and with new attractive optional equipment."}]}

Identify the article type based on its content and structure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify the type of the following BMW news article.\n\nThe new BMW CE 04 - the electric premium scooter in fresh colours and with new attractive optional equipment.The BMW CE 04 opened a new chapter in urban two-wheel mobility when it was launched in summer 2021 as an emission-free electric scooter for urban centres. Until today, the BMW CE 04 remains the undisputed market leader in the segment of all-electric motorcycles and scooters with an output of over 11 kW. The premium scooter has been specifically revised for this segment.\n\nThe Basic variant features Lightwhite uni body colour combined with a black-grey seat and clear windshield, giving the new BMW CE 04 a clean and consistent look.\n\nThe Avantgarde variant in the body colour Gravity blue metallic matt, combined with the contrasting colour Sao Paulo yellow, highlights the CE 04's dynamic and forward-thinking design. The Pro seat in black/light grey with yellow and white tapes, a yellow-tinted windshield, and a laser-engraved rear wheel rim complete the design.\n\nThe Exclusive variant features the Spacesilver metallic body colour combined with exclusive tapes, giving the CE 04 an especially elegant look. This version of the CE 04 also features increased wind and weather protection in the form of a large windshield with integrated hand protectors and heated grips. It also has a laser-engraved rear wheel rim on one side, a comfort seat with seat heating, new upholstery fabric and CE 04 embroidery.\n\nIncreased wind and weather protection in the form of a large windshield with integrated hand protectors, as well as a comfort seat with seat heating, are also available as optional equipment ex works for the other model variants. The new laser-engraved rear wheel rims on one side are reserved for the Avantgarde and Exclusive variants.\n\nThe optional equipment range for the new BMW CE 04 comprises the following:\n\nThe BMW CE 04 - the electric champion for the city. Like no other, it combines the latest electromobility technologies with emotion and great riding pleasure.\n\nManufactured at the BMW Group plant in Berlin, the birthplace of BMW motorcycles, the BMW CE 04 is packed with innovative technologies, particularly in terms of its drive and control systems, for which the BMW Group has filed several patent applications. With its electric drive, forward-looking design and innovative connectivity solutions, this scooter merges transport and communication functions and promises a great riding experience.\n\nPlenty of power and ample range for supreme riding in the city and in urban areas.\n\nWith a maximum output of 31 kW (42 hp), the BMW CE 04 has a powerful motor and offers outstanding riding pleasure. For the classic “traffic light start” discipline from 0 to 50 km/h, it takes just fast 2.6 seconds. Even in the reduced output L3e-A1 vehicle class, 23 kW (31 hp) drive power is available. The maximum speed of both versions is 120 km/h – for speedy progress not just in the city but on main roads and motorway sections, too.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 has an ample battery cell capacity of 60.6 Ah (8.9 kWh), providing a range of some 130 kilometres (reduced output version: 100 km). This enables day-to-day emission-free riding in the city, in an urban setting and for smaller-scale fun tours after work or at the weekend – with complete peace of mind.\n\nInnovative electric drive with liquid-cooled electric motor.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 has a permanent magnet electric motor mounted in the frame between the battery and the rear wheel, as used in a similar form in BMW cars such as the 225xe Active Tourer. BMW Motorrad conducted extensive riding tests to develop a specific type of recuperation for each riding mode, giving the rider a high-level convenience. This means that optimum performance and riding characteristics are available in every situation on the road.\n\nShort charging times and charging technology based on the system used in cars.\n\nThe lithium-ion battery is charged using the integrated charging device either at a regular household socket, a wallbox or a public charging station. When the battery is completely flat, charging time ideally lasts 4 hours and 20 minutes. With the quick charger available as an optional extra with an output of up to 6.9 kW (2.3 kW is the standard level), charging time is reduced to just 1 hour and 40 minutes when the battery is completely flat. If the battery level is only 20 per cent and the battery is charged to 80 per cent, the charging time is reduced to just 45 minutes with the optional quick charger. Depending on the market, the standard charging cable with a charging capacity of 2.3 kW comes as standard with the BMW CE 04.\n\nA Mode 3 charging cable is required for fast charging at the wallbox at home or at a public charging station. In the same way as with BMW automobiles, BMW Charging solutions are available for the BMW CE 04, too – for maximum flexibility based on numerous customised programmes for charging at home, on the road and at work.\n\nIncreased riding stability through slip control by means of ASC (Automatic Stability Control). DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) as an ex works option.\n\nSimilar to the ASC system found on BMW motorcycles with combustion engines, this traction control system is also available on the BMW CE 04. ASC limits the engine torque depending on the rear wheel slip. DTC, which is available as an option, provides even greater riding safety. DTC enables even more efficient and safe acceleration, especially in banking position.\n\nThree riding modes \"ECO\", \"RAIN\" and \"ROAD\" for efficient, everyday use as standard. “DYNAMIC” riding mode for further enhanced riding pleasure as an ex works option.\n\nIn developing the BMW CE 04, BMW Motorrad attached particular importance to providing opportunities for the rider to make an individual choice between maximum efficiency and maximum riding fun. Accordingly, the new BMW CE 04 features the three riding modes “ECO”, “RAIN” and “ROAD” as standard. The additional “DYNAMIC” riding mode is also available as an ex works option, enabling the scooter to accelerate at an even swifter pace.\n\nDirectionally stable suspension with one-piece tubular steel main frame for smooth handling and a high level of ride comfort.\n\nThe main frame is a tubular steel construction.

Many racing series, and consequently, BMW M Motorsport teams, take a break before the season's final push from September. However, the summer isn't entirely devoid of racing, and over the past weekends, there have been several successes to celebrate. The BMW M4 GT4 remains a winning car, and I am also delighted with the strong performance of the BMW M Team Studie with the BMW M4 GT3 in the highly competitive GT300 class of the Japanese Super GT Series. Congratulations to the successful teams and drivers, and to those who have some time off from racing, I wish you a relaxing break. Hopefully, we'll have plenty of reasons to celebrate together again in the season's final stretch!”\n\nJapanese Super GT Series: BMW M Team Studie achieves strong second place at Fuji.\n\nAbout four weeks after celebrating their first season victory in the GT300 class of the Japanese Super GT Series at Suzuka (JPN), BMW M Team Studie with the BMW M4 GT3 secured another podium finish at the fourth season event at Fuji (JPN). Seiji Ara and Masataka Yanagida (both JPN) took second place. The duo started the 450-kilometre race from 16th position, which began under rainy conditions behind the safety car. As the race progressed, the weather constantly changed, the track dried up, teams switched to slick tyres, and later, rain returned. Moreover, the race had to be briefly interrupted due to a GT300 vehicle catching fire. Ara and Yanagida showcased an outstanding comeback in the turbulent race in the #7 BMW M4 GT3, steadily advancing with a perfect strategy, and eventually securing second place on the podium. The victory propelled the team and Ara to the top position in the GT300 overall standings.\n\nIMPC: Strong presence of BMW M4 GT4 at Road America.\n\nIn the two-hour race of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge at Road America (USA) last weekend, five BMW M4 GT4 cars were on the grid. Three of them played leading roles in the battle for the podium but narrowly missed out after a fuel strategy gamble. Until around 15 minutes before the end of the race, the two Turner Motorsport cars and the Random Vandals Racing BMW M4 GT4 held positions one, two, and three. However, all three cars needed a safety car period to reach the finish without an additional fuel stop, which did not come, leading to the BMW M Motorsport teams' strategy not working out. In the end, the Turner Motorsport drivers, Robby Foley and Vincent Barletta (both USA), finished fourth, followed by Paul Sparta and Kenton Koch (both USA) from Random Vandals Racing in fifth place. Robert Megennis and Cameron Lawrence (both USA), driving the Turner Motorsport #95 BMW M4 GT4, started from pole position but finished seventh after their forced pit stop. Stephen Cameron Racing and Fast Track Racing were also present in the race, each with a BMW M4 GT4, finishing twelfth and thirteenth in the GS class.\n\nADAC GT4 Germany: Rain chaos at the Nürburgring.\n\nThe third season event of the ADAC GT4 Germany last weekend at the Nürburgring (GER) was marked by typical Eifel weather, with both races taking place under tricky rainy conditions.

In race one, a thriller with sudden rain during the starting grid formation, a drying track, and a red flag, Marat Khayrov (KGZ) and Gabriele Piana (ITA) finished eleventh in the team's #2 BMW M4 GT4. In the second race, also held in the rain, Leon Wassertheurer and Tim Reiter (both GER) in the #5 BMW M4 GT4 finished 16th, closely followed by Khayrov/Piana in 17th place.\n\nESET Cup Series: Trevor Racing secures two GT4 class victories at Most.\n\nThe fifth season event of the ESET Cup Series took place last weekend at Most, located in the northern part of the Czech Republic.

Among those involved were the two BMW M Motorsport teams, Schubert Motorsport and Project 1, who ran the BMW M4 GT3. Of the three BMW M works drivers who will contest the 2023 DTM season, only René Rast (GER) was present on Saturday. Defending champion Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER) arrived on Saturday evening, following their race in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), and took to the track for testing on Sunday.\n\nRast used the time to familiarise himself with the new BMW M4 GT3, completing more than 150 laps over the two days and setting the seventh fastest time overall: 1:28.417 minutes. “I am happy with the two days. We did a lot of laps and tried some things out. As an engineering crew, that also helped us make a lot of progress with my car. Sheldon joined us on Sunday and was able to show me a few things, as I am still adapting myself and my driving style to the BMW M4 GT3, even despite the good test.”\n\nVan der Linde did not take long to find his feet in the #1 car on Sunday. After roughly 100 laps, the 2022 champion had set the second fastest time of the whole weekend, with a lap of 1:28.138 minutes. “The test day was extremely important for me, especially as an opportunity get to know the new Pirelli tyres. Short runs, long runs – we tried everything, did a lot of laps and had good pace. With this in mind, we are happy. However, that was ultimately just one test at a circuit, at which the BMW M4 GT3 traditionally does well. As such, we should not read too much into it.”\n\nWittmann completed more than 80 laps for the Project1 team on Sunday, and his fastest time of 1:28.403 minutes was the fifth fastest of the weekend. “The double shift at the Nürburgring and Spielberg was quite stressful, I must say. However, it was definitely worth the effort. As a new team, we desperately need every test day to gain experience. Generally speaking, Sunday went well. However, we still have a lot of hard work ahead of us, and there is not a lot of time until the season-opener.”\n\nNLS: BMW M Motorsport teams claim more class wins.\n\nAs well as the overall one-two for the BMW M4 GT3, courtesy of the BMW Junior Team and ROWE Racing, there were also more class victories for BMW M Motorsport teams in race three of the 2023 Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on Saturday. Adrenalin Motorsport Team Motec was successful in two categories on the Nürburging-Nordschleife (GER). Victory in the VT2-R+4WD class went to Daniel Zils, Oskar Sandberg and Philipp Leisen (all GER) in the #1 BMW 330i. The BMW M240i Racing class was won by Adrenalin Motorsport Team Motec with Sven Markert, Nils Steinberg and Yannick Fübrich (all GER) in the cockpit of the #650 car.\n\nSchubert Motorsport triumphed in the BMW M2 CS class with the #888 car, driven by Stefan von Zabiensky, Michael von Zabiensky (both GER) and Andreas Jochimsen (DEN). First place in the V4 class went to Juha Miettinen (FIN) and Dan Berghult (SWE) with the #730 BMW 325i. In the SP4 class, Jörg Schönfelder and Christian Schotte (both GER) were successful in the #250 BMW 325i for MSG Bayerischer Wald Hutthurm e.V. im ADAC. Bernd Kleeschulte and David Ackermann (both GER) won the H4 class in the #600 BMW M3. FK Performance Motorsport also took second place in the large SP10 class. Nick Hancke, Thorsten Wolter and Nick Wüstenhagen (all GER) alternated at the wheel of the #187 BMW M4 GT4.\n\nJapanese Super GT: Season-opener with BMW M works driver Bruno Spengler at Okayama.\n\nBMW M works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN) contested his first race with BMW M Team Studie in the Japanese Super GT Championship at the weekend. An extremely turbulent season-opener awaited the Canadian at Okayama (JPN). Spengler and his team-mate Seiji Ara (JPN) overcame tricky conditions in qualifying to secure third place on the grid for the #7 BMW M4 GT3.\n\n“The conditions were very difficult in practice, with a lot of water on the track,” said Spengler after qualifying. “Then there was a red flag, which meant I only managed to complete two laps so I went into qualifying with only a few laps under my belt and had to get to know the track here in the rain during qualifying, which was basically my first practice session. However, it went very well for us. The car was fantastic in the wet. The team had done a fantastic job of preparing it.”\n\nThe race itself started in sunny, dry conditions, but a storm soon gathered. Heavy rain, hail and strong winds resulted in two red flags before the race was terminated after 62 of the scheduled 82 laps. Spengler and Ara ended the chaotic race in sixth place.\n\n“The race was crazy,” said Spengler. “So much happened in that one race. We were running in a solid third place while it was still dry. Then it began to rain heavily and we changed tyres. We were a bit unlucky with the red light upon exiting the pit lane, and I was spun before I got to the garage. We lost a lot of positions as a result. We dropped back to 21st and fought our way back to sixth. That was a great comeback. We could definitely have finished on the podium in this race, but so much happened that we can be very satisfied with sixth place. The guys did a great job during the pit stops. It was very difficult for everyone. I thank the team for its hard work and the good job it did. This result is a good start to the season.”\n\nBritish GT Championship: Successful start to season for Century Motorsport.\n\nBMW M Motorsport team Century Motorsport made a successful start to this season’s British GT Championship on the Easter weekend. Among those in action was BMW M works driver Dan Harper (GBR), who shares the cockpit of the team’s #91 BMW M4 GT3 with Darren Leung (GBR) this year. The duo finished sixth in both races at Oulton Park (GBR). Harper also set the fastest lap time of the weekend.\n\nCentury Motorsport ran two new BMW M4 GT4s in the GT4 class – and claimed its first podiums at the season-opener. Carl Cavers and Lewis Plato (both GBR) in the #22 BMW M4 GT4 finished second in the Pro-Am class in the first of the two races, followed in third place by their team-mates Michael Johnston and Chris Salkeld (both GBR / #14 BMW M4 GT4). Johnston and Salkeld also came home third in race two.\n\nGT4 France: Easter Cup at Nogaro.\n\nGT4 France kicked off the 2023 season with the traditional Easter Cup at Nogaro (FRA). Here too, the BMW M Motorsport teams ran the new BMW M4 GT4. The L’Espace Bienvenue team finished sixth and fifth in the Silver class in the first two races of the year. The #17 BMW M4 GT4 was again driven by Ricardo van der Ende (NED) and Benjamin Lessennes (BEL). In the AM class, Carla Debard and Eric Debard (both FRA) came home fourth and eighth in the #21 BMW M4 GT4 for the Debard Automobiles By Racetivity team.\n\nBMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux: Debutant Senna van Soelen dominates at Zandvoort.\n\nThe dune circuit at Zandvoort (NED) was the venue for the opening round of the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux at the weekend, and it was a debutant who dominated proceedings: Senna van Soelen (NED). The 17-year-old from the Bas Koeten Racing team won both races.\n\nVan Soelen shone in the first race. Starting from pole position, he led from lights to flag. The duo of Sen Roodenburg / Gianni van de Craats (both NED) was initially hot on his heels, but van Soelen opened a five-second lead after the mandatory pit stop. Jop Rappange / Dirk Warmerdam (both NED) were third, meaning the podium was occupied solely by Bas Koeten Racing drivers.\n\nDebutant van Soelen repeated his success in race two. This time too, he led from start to finish. Second place went to Berry van Elk (NED) from the BlueBerry Racing team, with Roodenburg / van de Craats having to settle for third place this time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you a regular overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams."}]}

Heavy rain, hail and strong winds resulted in two red flags before the race was terminated after 62 of the scheduled 82 laps. Spengler and Ara ended the chaotic race in sixth place.\n\n“The race was crazy,” said Spengler. “So much happened in that one race. We were running in a solid third place while it was still dry. Then it began to rain heavily and we changed tyres. We were a bit unlucky with the red light upon exiting the pit lane, and I was spun before I got to the garage. We lost a lot of positions as a result. We dropped back to 21st and fought our way back to sixth. That was a great comeback. We could definitely have finished on the podium in this race, but so much happened that we can be very satisfied with sixth place. The guys did a great job during the pit stops. It was very difficult for everyone. I thank the team for its hard work and the good job it did. This result is a good start to the season.”\n\nBritish GT Championship: Successful start to season for Century Motorsport.\n\nBMW M Motorsport team Century Motorsport made a successful start to this season’s British GT Championship on the Easter weekend. Among those in action was BMW M works driver Dan Harper (GBR), who shares the cockpit of the team’s #91 BMW M4 GT3 with Darren Leung (GBR) this year. The duo finished sixth in both races at Oulton Park (GBR). Harper also set the fastest lap time of the weekend.\n\nCentury Motorsport ran two new BMW M4 GT4s in the GT4 class – and claimed its first podiums at the season-opener. Carl Cavers and Lewis Plato (both GBR) in the #22 BMW M4 GT4 finished second in the Pro-Am class in the first of the two races, followed in third place by their team-mates Michael Johnston and Chris Salkeld (both GBR / #14 BMW M4 GT4). Johnston and Salkeld also came home third in race two.\n\nGT4 France: Easter Cup at Nogaro.\n\nGT4 France kicked off the 2023 season with the traditional Easter Cup at Nogaro (FRA). Here too, the BMW M Motorsport teams ran the new BMW M4 GT4. The L’Espace Bienvenue team finished sixth and fifth in the Silver class in the first two races of the year. The #17 BMW M4 GT4 was again driven by Ricardo van der Ende (NED) and Benjamin Lessennes (BEL). In the AM class, Carla Debard and Eric Debard (both FRA) came home fourth and eighth in the #21 BMW M4 GT4 for the Debard Automobiles By Racetivity team.\n\nBMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux: Debutant Senna van Soelen dominates at Zandvoort.\n\nThe dune circuit at Zandvoort (NED) was the venue for the opening round of the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux at the weekend, and it was a debutant who dominated proceedings: Senna van Soelen (NED). The 17-year-old from the Bas Koeten Racing team won both races.\n\nVan Soelen shone in the first race. Starting from pole position, he led from lights to flag. The duo of Sen Roodenburg / Gianni van de Craats (both NED) was initially hot on his heels, but van Soelen opened a five-second lead after the mandatory pit stop. Jop Rappange / Dirk Warmerdam (both NED) were third, meaning the podium was occupied solely by Bas Koeten Racing drivers.\n\nDebutant van Soelen repeated his success in race two. This time too, he led from start to finish. Second place went to Berry van Elk (NED) from the BlueBerry Racing team, with Roodenburg / van de Craats having to settle for third place this time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The 76th Cannes Film Festival is underway, but one particularly spectacular world premiere on the bill will be experienced in the port area of the southern French town rather than on a cinema screen. This is where the BMW brand and boat maker TYDE are presenting THE ICON, a new kind of flagbearer for sustainable mobility on water. THE ICON is the first battery-powered marine craft of its kind and brings together locally emission-free travel with a vision of luxury that embraces pleasure.\n\nAt 13.15 metres in length and with a top speed of 30 knots, THE ICON is a trailblazer for a new breed of watercraft with battery-electric drive. BMW came up with the idea and developed the concept for this pioneering collaborative endeavour. The innovative project is the result of an in-depth sharing of knowledge between experts from myriad branches of mobility, with the BMW team at the helm. Responsible for the design of THE ICON are the creatives at innovation hub Designworks, a BMW Group subsidiary with studios in Los Angeles, Munich and Shanghai. The development and realisation of the concept was entrusted to boat maker TYDE. And the powerful electric drive system sources its energy from high-voltage batteries supplied by BMW i. The marine travel experience created through this confluence of talents is accompanied by an exclusive soundtrack composed by award-winning film score luminary Hans Zimmer.\n\nBMW points the way for innovative concepts driving sustainable mobility.\n\nAs the pioneering force behind THE ICON, BMW is once again demonstrating a holistic commitment to sustainable mobility that encompasses not only road transportation but also travel on water. Pooling technological expertise from various fields creates ground-breaking solutions that have people at their heart.\n\nTHE ICON also encapsulates a future-facing form of luxury. The innovative craft appeals with its unique design, and it also offers passengers a totally new experience of mobility. Here, amid an exclusive on-board ambience, exquisite comfort converges with a significantly reduced environmental impact.\n\nInnovations from yacht racing enable electrification and decarbonisation on the water.\n\nTHE ICON uses a battery-electric drive system to set new standards in its sector in various ways. Up to now, marine electric mobility has been restricted to smaller, slower craft with comparatively little range. And the segment for faster boats with longer range is dominated by models with combustion engines. THE ICON redefines this relationship between the dimensions, top speed and range of an electrically powered watercraft.\n\nMaking this possible is an innovation from yacht racing: hydrofoils. These reduce the energy requirement by up to 80 per cent compared with a conventional hull. The foiling technology – whereby the craft rides on wing structures below the water level, while the hull floats above the surface of the water – also provides a higher level of travelling comfort and higher speeds.\n\nA pair of 100 kW electric motors convert the 240 kWh of energy supplied by six batteries from the BMW i3 into an eye-catching range of more than 50 nautical miles (approx. 100 km). The craft can deliver an operating speed of 24 knots, while its maximum speed is 30 knots (55 km/h). Spurred on by its innovative drive system and foiling technology, THE ICON makes almost silent progress, without vibrations or shocks and without sending out waves.\n\nEnsuring a similarly impressive on-board soundscape, meanwhile, is the Dolby Atmos system, with its ability to deliver superb audio quality. When it came to developing the sound concept – comprising the drive system note and pleasant, intuitive function tones – for the job at hand, BMW turned to double Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer. The revolutionary acoustic creations conjured by the Hollywood composer soundtrack a new era in the enjoyment of sustainable travel on water.\n\nTHE ICON: unparalleled innovative power also reflected in its design.\n\nThe design team had the task of translating the unique concept of THE ICON into an iconic experience – from its initial visual impact from the outside to the view out from the inside. The body of the watercraft, which is made up of a very flat hull and a central support element for the transparent architecture, is shaped by a technically precise design language. The basic outline, with its prism-like form, enables a width of 4.5 metres in the rear section. This creates a very spacious entrance into the luxurious lounge. The hull itself stands out with its origami lightweight structure. With the foiling technology enabling a particularly smooth traveling experience, the designers took the opportunity to replace the conventional side sections of a watercraft with large glass surfaces. Passengers therefore enjoy an extraordinary view while they glide above the water. Modern LED light strips at the bow and stern, and on the charging connection points feed into the iconic effect of THE ICON.\n\nTHE ICON: a social meeting place that’s at home in any port.\n\nAngled glass doors provide access to a lounge area which, with its artistically designed furniture on a luxurious carpet, brings to mind a kaleidoscope. Every piece is formed from sections of metal sheeting whose granular surface structure reflects the sunlight onto the floor like waves on the sea.\n\nThe 360° rotating seats are at the core of a user-focused experience, with all essential features – including a tablet-based infotainment system – arranged within reach. With a simple twist, the seats can be re-positioned to facilitate social interaction. This creates a fine meeting hub that will feel at home in any port or harbour.\n\nBMW interface groups nautical instruments within a digital control unit.\n\nThe craft’s command station is located centrally on the deck and represents a compelling proposition with its ship's wheel and instruments in authentic BMW design. Taking the place of the traditional array of nautical instruments is a fresh interpretation of the BMW interface containing all important functions within a digital control unit. The intersection between human and machine comes in the form of a 32-inch touchscreen display with 6k resolution and the look and feel of the BMW iDrive control/operation system. Teaming up with BMW Operating System 8, this unlocks a new dimension in information visualisation and digital interaction. Key functions such as range information and weather reports can be called up using voice commands.\n\nThe watercraft revealed in Cannes for the first time is not a design study or a concept, but instead a fully production-ready example of its kind boasting pioneering technology. THE ICON is underpinned by a platform concept offering comprehensive adaptability to individual wishes and needs in terms of both the emotional experience and interior design. It is focused on modern, urban lifestyles and can be used as a means of marine transport both by luxury-conscious private customers and in the commercial sector. The craft produced on the basis of THE ICON will accelerate the cause of emission-free luxury mobility on water and open up a whole new segment. Their mission will be to inspire CO2-free water-bound mobility – without polluting the environment, without any noise, but with comfort turned up to the max.\n\nTHE ICON impresses with a powerful drive system that creates neither noise nor emissions. Foiling technology allows it to reach high speeds without generating waves or dragging out a wake behind it.

With the foiling technology enabling a particularly smooth traveling experience, the designers took the opportunity to replace the conventional side sections of a watercraft with large glass surfaces. Passengers therefore enjoy an extraordinary view while they glide above the water. Modern LED light strips at the bow and stern, and on the charging connection points feed into the iconic effect of THE ICON.\n\nTHE ICON: a social meeting place that’s at home in any port.\n\nAngled glass doors provide access to a lounge area which, with its artistically designed furniture on a luxurious carpet, brings to mind a kaleidoscope. Every piece is formed from sections of metal sheeting whose granular surface structure reflects the sunlight onto the floor like waves on the sea.\n\nThe 360° rotating seats are at the core of a user-focused experience, with all essential features – including a tablet-based infotainment system – arranged within reach. With a simple twist, the seats can be re-positioned to facilitate social interaction. This creates a fine meeting hub that will feel at home in any port or harbour.\n\nBMW interface groups nautical instruments within a digital control unit.\n\nThe craft’s command station is located centrally on the deck and represents a compelling proposition with its ship's wheel and instruments in authentic BMW design. Taking the place of the traditional array of nautical instruments is a fresh interpretation of the BMW interface containing all important functions within a digital control unit. The intersection between human and machine comes in the form of a 32-inch touchscreen display with 6k resolution and the look and feel of the BMW iDrive control/operation system. Teaming up with BMW Operating System 8, this unlocks a new dimension in information visualisation and digital interaction. Key functions such as range information and weather reports can be called up using voice commands.\n\nThe watercraft revealed in Cannes for the first time is not a design study or a concept, but instead a fully production-ready example of its kind boasting pioneering technology. THE ICON is underpinned by a platform concept offering comprehensive adaptability to individual wishes and needs in terms of both the emotional experience and interior design. It is focused on modern, urban lifestyles and can be used as a means of marine transport both by luxury-conscious private customers and in the commercial sector. The craft produced on the basis of THE ICON will accelerate the cause of emission-free luxury mobility on water and open up a whole new segment. Their mission will be to inspire CO2-free water-bound mobility – without polluting the environment, without any noise, but with comfort turned up to the max.\n\nTHE ICON impresses with a powerful drive system that creates neither noise nor emissions. Foiling technology allows it to reach high speeds without generating waves or dragging out a wake behind it. Indeed, the only things THE ICON leaves behind during every journey are pleasure and joy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

From 21st to 25th June 2023, Golfclub München Eichenried hosts the BMW International Open. Tournament organiser BMW has again assembled a top-class field and put together a fantastic sporting and event experience for all the visitors to the course, as well as for all those golf fans unable to make it. Away from the fairways too, the 34th edition of this prestigious tournament has plenty to offer.\n\nThe long-term charity campaign “Eagles for Education” is making its debut at the BMW International Open in 2023. The BMW Group will donate 1,000 euros for every eagle achieved during the tournament. This sees BMW intensify its long commitment to education and future opportunities for all. The money will go to the organisations “JOBLINGE” and “Kick ins Leben”, with which the BMW Group has been working for many years.\n\n“The BMW Group is aware of its social responsibility and is expanding its commitment to the BMW International Open,” said Stefan Teuchert, Head of BMW Germany and Tournament President. “With the launch of the ‘Eagles for Education’ campaign, we will support two organisations at this year’s BMW International Open, with whom we are working to achieve better career opportunities for underprivileged children and young people. We are confident that we can make a sustainable contribution in this region through this commitment.”\n\nThe commitment to education enjoys a long tradition in the BMW Group. At the PGA TOUR Playoff event the BMW Championship, a total of 44.5 million US dollars (roughly 41.4 million euros) have been raised for the “Evans Scholar Foundation” since the start of the partnership with organiser the Western Golf Association back in 2007. This has allowed the foundation to provide full college scholarships for more than 3,300 caddies in need of financial support.\n\nNot only will the two partner organisations benefit from an eagle on the 17th hole, but also the player who scored it. This is because an eagle on a par-three hole is also an ace. This year’s Hole-in-One Award, which is traditionally up for grabs on the 17th hole at Golfclub München Eichenried, is the first ever fully-electric BMW 5 Series. The BMW i5 plays a leading role on the road to sustainable premium mobility in the upper middle class and, appropriately for the BMW International Open, is a true Bavarian: as with all previous generations of this model, the new BMW 5 Series saloon is built in the BMW Group plant at Dingolfing, where the electric motors and high-voltage batteries for the BMW i5 are also produced.\n\nAll you need to know about the BMW International Open 2023.\n\nBMW has organised the BMW International Open since 1989.

From 21st to 25th June 2023, Golfclub München Eichenried hosts the BMW International Open. Tournament organiser BMW has again assembled a top-class field and put together a fantastic sporting and event experience for all the visitors to the course, as well as for all those golf fans unable to make it. Away from the fairways too, the 34th edition of this prestigious tournament has plenty to offer.\n\nThe long-term charity campaign “Eagles for Education” is making its debut at the BMW International Open in 2023. The BMW Group will donate 1,000 euros for every eagle achieved during the tournament. This sees BMW intensify its long commitment to education and future opportunities for all. The money will go to the organisations “JOBLINGE” and “Kick ins Leben”, with which the BMW Group has been working for many years.\n\n“The BMW Group is aware of its social responsibility and is expanding its commitment to the BMW International Open,” said Stefan Teuchert, Head of BMW Germany and Tournament President. “With the launch of the ‘Eagles for Education’ campaign, we will support two organisations at this year’s BMW International Open, with whom we are working to achieve better career opportunities for underprivileged children and young people. We are confident that we can make a sustainable contribution in this region through this commitment.”\n\nThe commitment to education enjoys a long tradition in the BMW Group. At the PGA TOUR Playoff event the BMW Championship, a total of 44.5 million US dollars (roughly 41.4 million euros) have been raised for the “Evans Scholar Foundation” since the start of the partnership with organiser the Western Golf Association back in 2007. This has allowed the foundation to provide full college scholarships for more than 3,300 caddies in need of financial support.\n\nNot only will the two partner organisations benefit from an eagle on the 17th hole, but also the player who scored it. This is because an eagle on a par-three hole is also an ace. This year’s Hole-in-One Award, which is traditionally up for grabs on the 17th hole at Golfclub München Eichenried, is the first ever fully-electric BMW 5 Series. The BMW i5 plays a leading role on the road to sustainable premium mobility in the upper middle class and, appropriately for the BMW International Open, is a true Bavarian: as with all previous generations of this model, the new BMW 5 Series saloon is built in the BMW Group plant at Dingolfing, where the electric motors and high-voltage batteries for the BMW i5 are also produced.\n\nAll you need to know about the BMW International Open 2023.\n\nBMW has organised the BMW International Open since 1989. No other tournament on the DP World Tour has been held under the same name and with the same partner for as long.\n\n2 million US dollars, with 340,000 US dollars going to the winner.\n\nTop international players in the field.\n\nLuke Donald (ENG, Ryder Cup captain), Thomas Bjørn (DEN, vice captain), Edoardo Molinari (ITA, vice captain), Nicolas Colsaerts (BEL, vice captain), Haotong Li (CHN, defending champion), Nicolai Højgaard, Rasmus Højgaard (both DEN), Robert MacIntyre (SCO), Rafa Cabrera Bello, Pablo Larrazábal (both ESP), Victor Perez (FRA), Adrian Meronk (POL), Ryan Fox (NZL).\n\nGerman players in the field.\n\nMatti Schmid, Max Kieffer, Marcel Siem, Yannik Paul, Alex Cejka, Nick Bachem, Hurly Long, Marcel Schneider, Nicolai von Dellingshausen, Alexander Knappe, Freddy Schott, Maximilian Schmitt, Philipp Mejow, Jannik De Bruyn, Michael Hirmer, Marc Hammer, Sebastian Heisele, Velten Meyer.\n\nGerman amateurs in the field.\n\nJonas Baumgartner (GC Hösel), Tim Wiedemeyer (Münchner Golfclub).\n\nTournament invitations.\n\nTakumi Kanaya (JPN, winner of the BMW Japan Golf Championship), Rasmus Rosin (SWE, winner of the NEXT Golf Tour powered by Trackman), Thomas Rosenmüller (GER), Elvis Smylie (AUS), Filippo Celli (ITA), Alex Cejka (GER).\n\nThe Pro-Am takes place on Wednesday 22nd June and features big-name sports stars like Champions League winners Thomas Müller (GER) and Gareth Bale (WAL), and Long Drive world champion Martin Borgmeier (GER). Admission is free.\n\n2023 is a Ryder Cup year again. As Worldwide Partner of the legendary team competition, BMW is bringing the iconic trophy to the BMW International Open. Fans can get close to the coveted gold trophy and pose for photos/selfies with it. Each day, visitors also have the chance to win season tickets for the Ryder Cup in Rome at the “Longest Putt Challenge”.\n\nThe Ryder Cup also plays a major role on the fairways in Munich. The European team slowly takes shape in June, which is why captain Luke Donald and his three vice captains – Thomas Bjørn, Edoardo Molinari and Nicolas Colsaerts – are using the tournament to take a closer look at the form of the contenders, including a number of German pros.\n\nEyes firmly on youth.\n\nThe BMW International Open is looking to inspire the next generation of golfers. For this reason, children and youngsters aged 16 and under have free admission on each day of the tournament. As part of the German Golf Association’s project “Abschlag Schule”, school classes will visit the tournament on Wednesday and take a look behind the scenes. In cooperation with the Bavarian Golf Association, youth teams from around the region will be invited on Wednesday, when they can look forward to a special itinerary.\n\nFrom Thursday to Sunday, from the afternoon and after the close of play, a DJ in the beer garden will make for a relaxed and chilled out end to an exciting day of golf.\n\nVisitors can show off their own golfing skills in the “Nearest to the Pin” competition, in cooperation with TrackMan. In a simulator and with attractive prizes up for grabs, the goal is to get as close to the flag as possible on the virtual 12th hole of the Championship Course.\n\nIn addition to live images from the course, the central video wall in the Tournament Village will display extensive live statistics on the player currently on the screen, in collaboration with tournament partner NTT Data. This will make for a golfing experience of unparalleled depth.\n\nGolf fans can head to for a free multimedia offering that is as worthwhile for spectators on site as it is for fans following the tournament from afar. The highlights include a detailed livestream, live leaderboard, exciting live statistics and an interactive player locator. There will also be informative, entertaining content on the BMW International Open. BMW Golfsport will also be following the tournament on their social media channels, with entertaining content, exclusive productions and everything you need to know.\n\nBMW International Open live.\n\nGolf fans have several options for following the BMW International Open from afar.

During the DTM at the Norisring, we were able to celebrate a 1-2-3 for the BMW M4 GT4 in ADAC GT4 Germany. There was also reason to rejoice in numerous other racing series. In front of the impressive backdrop of the Truck Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, the FK Performance Motorsport team once again underlined their title ambitions in the ADAC GT Masters. In the IMSA series, there were some strong results, even though the leap to the very top unfortunately did not happen this time. Congratulations to Century Motorsport for a strong British GT weekend at Snetterton – and also to all other teams and drivers who have achieved success as ambassadors for the BMW brand in recent weeks.”\n\nADAC GT Masters (13th-14th July): Another podium for FK Performance Motorsport.\n\nLeon Köhler (GER) and Maxime Oosten (NED) are still at the forefront of the title race after a strong ADAC GT Masters race weekend during the Truck Grand Prix at the Nürburgring (GER). The FK Performance Motorsport duo secured third place on the podium in the #54 BMW M4 GT3 in the second race on Sunday. The day before, they also collected many important points by finishing fourth. Köhler and Oosten impressed with strong comebacks in each race – on Saturday from seventh to fourth, and on Sunday even from tenth to third. In the drivers' standings, the duo is in second place with 109 points each, just nine points behind the leaders. In the second BMW M4 GT3 from FK Performance Motorsport, Eduardo Coseteng (PHI) and Grégory de Sybourg (SUI) finished eleventh and sixteenth.\n\nIMSA Series (13th-14th July): Action-packed race weekend in Canada.\n\nAll IMSA series were present last weekend at the Continental Tire Motorsport Park in Canada. In the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, the GTP prototypes took a break this time, but in the GTD PRO and GTD classes, a BMW M4 GT3 was in action. Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) narrowly missed the GTD podium in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 of Turner Motorsport, finishing fourth. After 112 laps on the traditional track, the duo was less than three seconds behind third place. Paul Miller Racing finished eighth in the GTD PRO category with the #1 BMW M4 GT3 and drivers Madison Snow and Bryan Sellers (both USA).\n\nThe IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge also made a stop in Canada. Three BMW M4 GT4s entered the two-hour race, two of which had the podium in sight but ultimately had to settle for fourth and fifth places. The fourth place went to Sean McAlister and Jeff Westphal (both USA) in the #39 BMW M4 GT4 from CarBahn Motorsports. Right behind them, Robby Foley and Francis Selldorff (both USA) from Turner Motorsport crossed the finish line. Their teammates Dillon Machavern and Robert Megennis (both USA) finished twelfth.\n\nIn the VP Racing SportsCar Challenge, there was a podium finish to celebrate. In the second race, Patrick Wilmot (USA) in the #88 BMW M4 GT4 from Split Decision Motorsports finished third in the GSX class. In the first race, Wilmot was fifth.\n\nBritish GT Championship (13th-14th July): Class victory for the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nAt the British GT Championship race weekend at Snetterton (GBR), the Century Motorsport team had reason to celebrate. In the first of the two races, Ravi Ramyead and Charlie Robertson (both GBR) in the #71 BMW M4 GT4 secured class victory. In the second race, the duo retired. Their teammates Carl Cavers and Jason Plato (both GBR) were pleased with third place in the SA category in their #22 BMW M4 GT3 after the second race.\n\nBMW M works driver Max Hesse (GER) experienced a sportingly strong but ultimately bizarre weekend. He made his debut alongside John Ferguson (GBR) at the wheel of the #15 BMW M4 GT3 from RAM Racing in the British GT Championship, as Raffaele Marciello (SUI) was simultaneously competing in Brazil in the FIA World Endurance Championship. After finishing sixth in the first race, Hesse and Ferguson put on a great show and finished third on the podium in the second race.

MINI provides a first glimpse of the trend-setting design of the upcoming all-electric model family: Charismatic Simplicity is called the reduced design language that focuses on the essentials. Each new MINI model gains its own strong individual character that is expressed in distinctive design features, while exuding individuality with a clear brand affiliation. Sustainable materials are another essential part of the new design language.\n\n“With our new Charismatic Simplicity design language, we are completely rethinking the iconic MINI. Our purist, progressive approach combines the simplicity of functional elements with the emotionality that MINI is renowned for,” says Oliver Heilmer, Head of MINI Design. “We are convinced that the conscious reduction to a few, but expressive elements enable innovations that would have been unthinkable before.”\n\nRound OLED display combines tradition with state-of-the-art technology. At the centre of the visually reduced interior is the circular central instrument display iconic of MINI, which will be reinterpreted in the form of an OLED display in the upcoming model family. MINI is the world’s first car manufacturer to offer a touch display with a fully usable round surface. The OLED display has a diameter of 240 millimetres and combines the functions of the instrument cluster and the on-board monitor. The sleek design and frameless look give it a particularly highquality appearance. The touch control enables a completely new, minimalistic user interface that also controls the integrated infotainment and climate functions. With the purist dashboard as a stage for the circular central display, MINI continues the traditional design heritage of the classic MINI.\n\nSustainably inspired variety of materials: steering wheel and seats. In addition to the central display, the steering wheel of the next model family was also fundamentally redesigned. The standard version comes with a two-spoke design. The optional version adds a distinctive fabric finish as a third element in addition to a sporty geometry. The upcoming MINI model family inspires with its high-quality and sustainable variety of materials and colours as well as innovative textile designs. Vibrant Silver is a recurring colour accent, adding a special touch with its shimmering metallic appearance, both outside and in.\n\nThe range of seats is equally diverse. A fresh combination of new colours and patterns paired with classic style elements like the houndstooth pattern build a bridge from the past to the future. Laminated seat side panels look particularly valuable and show the attention to detail. Like the armrests integrated into the seats for the first time, they contribute to the homely atmosphere of the interior.\n\nNew rim design promotes dimensions and aerodynamics. The completely redesigned light-alloy wheels also follow the principle of the new design language. The MINI wheels of the upcoming model family no longer focus on the sculptural nature of the spoke structure, but on a graphic design characterised by strong colour contrasts. This creates an illusion of size, which is further emphasised by the outward-pointing spokes. The pared-back, two-dimensional wheel design contributes to improved aerodynamic qualities and increased range with its somewhat compact, two-dimensional design.\n\nWith these innovative design highlights, MINI is already dropping a hint of the ground-breaking step the Charismatic Simplicity principle is taking. The new MINI design language combines quality, sustainability, and purist reinvention in perfect synthesis with the historic DNA of the brand."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

We continue to steer our strategic course into the future, while avoiding short-term adjustments that could jeopardise our long-term success.\n\nOur commitment to technology openness has proven its value – and is paying off today more than ever.\n\nOur global positioning across sales, production and our supplier network secures us access to markets worldwide.\n\nBMW is a global company with a strong presence in all relevant economic regions. I regularly take the time to see this for myself. This doesn't work at a distance, but is best done when you are on the ground.\n\nSo, over the past three months, I have visited markets in all of our four sales regions – in Europe, the Americas, China and our emerging “Fourth Pillar Region”, which includes Southeast Asia and the Middle East, among others.\n\nOur global approach has often allowed us to compensate for fluctuating demand in individual markets. Of course, we are monitoring current developments in China very closely. The economic conditions there are challenging – and that applies to all market participants.\n\nHowever, it’s our ambition to perform better than our competitors, even in a challenging environment.\n\nThe key to this lies in our highly attractive product line-up. This enabled the BMW brand to deliver solid sales growth in Europe in the first nine months of the year.\n\nWith sales up by over 7 percent, we are significantly outperforming the total European market and expanding our market share.\n\nThere was particularly high demand\n\nand in France, with a gain of 14 percent.\n\nAnd the BMW brand is also growing in markets such as South Korea, Australia and India.\n\nGlobal demand for our high-margin models in the upper vehicle segments remains stable. The high-performance cars of BMW M reported sales growth of two percent in the year to the end of September. This month also sees the market launch of the latest M model many fans have been waiting for: the BMW M5 Touring*.\n\nWe are constantly expanding our product range across all drive variants in line with customer demand. Our highly flexible production network allows us to tap market potential.\n\nThis applies in particular to our all-electric models. In virtually every relevant segment, the BMW Group has at least one pure electric vehicle.\n\nAcross BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, customers have a choice of more than 15 different models. This means that the BMW Group has one of the broadest ranges of fully-electric vehicles among its competitors.\n\nSales in the first nine months of the year underscore the success of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy.\n\nWhile other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – are seeing a significant decrease in sales, battery-electric vehicles remain a growth driver for us in 2024.\n\nBy the end of September, we had sold almost 300,000 BEVs – an increase of more than 19 percent compared to the same period of last year. In the third quarter, battery-electric vehicles already accounted for 19 percent of the BMW Group’s total sales.\n\nThe BMW brand's fully-electric models performed particularly well in Europe – with sales climbing 36 percent in the first nine months.\n\nGlobally, BMW’s strong BEV portfolio fed growth in deliveries of more than 22 percent. The BMW i4* remains the brand's most popular electric vehicle.\n\nIt is closely followed by the BMW iX1*, which – like the BMW i7* – recorded double-digit growth. The first all-electric BMW iX2* is also on track for success following its market launch.\n\nThe new all-electric MINI models – led by the MINI Cooper SE* – are also being very well received. With a sales increase of 54 percent, MINI BEVs experienced highly dynamic growth in the third quarter. Starting this month, the all-electric MINI Aceman* will also be available in Europe.\n\nFor the first time, MINI is also electrifying its John Cooper Works variants. The MINI John Cooper Works Electric* and MINI John Cooper Works Aceman* celebrated their premiere at the Paris Motor Show.\n\nPerformance and driving dynamics are the clear focal point in both models. From January 2025 onwards, they will captivate even the most dedicated motorsport fans.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, we anticipate another significant increase in sales of fully and partially electrified vehicles. For that reason, we see no need to modify or delay the European Union's stricter CO2 fleet targets for 2025.\n\nWe have been working intensively to meet these new fleet targets for a very long time. We are therefore confident that we will also meet the stricter requirements for 2025, as we have consistently in the last years.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that a comprehensive and critical review of CO2 fleet legislation in the EU following 2025 is absolutely essential.\n\nWhat matters most is every tonne of CO2 we can save today – not sometime in the future. This is why the use of low-CO2 fuels, such as e-fuels, E25 or HVO100, should also be revisited. These fuels could immediately improve the carbon footprint of the more than 250 million vehicles already on roads in the EU.\n\nBy 2030, all-electric vehicles will account for more than 50 percent of our total sales. The rollout of our fully-electric NEUE KLASSE will play an important part in this.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is now entering the final straight – and we are keeping this forward-looking project on track. With a new design, the next generation of electric drives and a comprehensive digital experience, the NEUE KLASSE will set completely new standards.\n\nIn just under a year, the first series-production SAV model of the NEUE KLASSE will roll off the line at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary. This will soon be followed by a sporty sedan from our main plant in Munich.\n\nPreparations for the launch are progressing well:\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we will elevate our entire vehicle portfolio to a whole new level of innovation. This will be possible thanks to our use of technology clusters, which can be integrated into all future vehicles.\n\nIn this way, all our products will benefit from the technological leaps we will achieve with the NEUE KLASSE. This applies not only to our all-electric vehicles, but across all drive technologies.\n\nOur continued, systematic implementation of technology openness also ensures that we will continue to offer the latest ICE models in the coming years.\n\nIn 2028, we will introduce another element to our drive train portfolio: the BMW Group’s first series-produced fuel cell vehicle.\n\nHydrogen will play an increasingly important role in decarbonisation. This makes vehicles with a fuel cell drive train a logical complement to established drive technologies.\n\nTo develop the new generation of fuel cell drive trains, we are deepening our long-standing cooperation with Toyota. We announced this in September together with Toyota CEO Koji Sato.\n\nThis collaboration also shares the goal of expanding infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling and electric vehicle charging.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe European automotive industry currently faces fundamentally different challenges from those we have faced in the past.\n\nWe are not dealing with a singular, overarching occurrence.\n\nInstead, we are facing a tangle of critical influencing factors that keep growing in number.\n\nIn such a phase, we do not need short-term incentives that only create a fleeting impact. What global companies truly need is a reliable and binding framework for progress and prosperity.\n\nThe introduction of tariffs on electric vehicles imported into the EU from China is just one example. Import duties do NOT make European manufacturers any more competitive.\n\nOn the contrary: They undermine the business models of companies that operate globally.\n\nAnd, since these tariffs mainly affect small electric cars built by European manufacturers, they could even impede the growth of e-mobility.\n\nMeasures like these are also inconsistent with the EU value of free trade. Free movement of goods is a key success factor for economic growth – not just within the European Union, but globally.\n\nFree trade remains a guiding principle for the BMW Group – and we will continue to advocate for it. Because protectionism always carries the risk that measures will provoke countermeasures – ultimately hurting everyone involved, rather than benefitting any of them.\n\nWe operate as a global player, making it all the more important to maintain our strategy of balanced global positioning. This applies as much to our sales and production network as to our selection of suppliers.\n\nWe continue to systematically expand our “local for local” approach – making our supply chains more resilient and improving our access to different market regions.\n\nAnd while Germany’s future as an industrial location may be questioned by some, we are making investments here.\n\nIn Irlbach-Straßkirchen in Bavaria, we are building a new assembly plant for the latest generation of high-voltage batteries. They will be used for the first time in the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nA total of five new assembly plants are under construction near our production sites worldwide, across all three major sales regions – Europe, the Americas and China.\n\nIn this way, we are already laying the foundation today for successful growth in the future.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis past quarter, we faced a series of extraordinary challenges.\n\nOne of the BMW Group’s biggest strengths is our ability to consistently find the right solutions and implement the necessary steps swiftly and efficiently.\n\nOur company maintains a robust global presence. Our strategic direction for the future is solid. We are carefully adapting our approach to changing conditions and planning for a range of scenarios.\n\nWe continue to be guided by the developments we can realistically expect to see in different regions of the world.\n\nThe fourth quarter will demonstrate that our measures – despite all the ongoing challenges – yield positive results. We therefore approach the final quarter of the current financial year with a sense of confidence.\n\nWe are striking a balance between securing short-term earnings and long-term success: This year, we are investing more than ever in new products, technologies and our plants, so that we can continue the BMW success story with the NEUE KLASSE from next year onwards.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Touring: energy consumption weighted combined: 27,6 kWh/100 km and 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery: G; weighted combined: B; fuel consumption with unloaded battery: 10,9 l/100 km (WLTP) BMW i4 eDrive40 Gran Coupé: energy consumption weighted combined: 18,6 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A BMW iX1 eDrive20: energy consumption weighted combined: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 474 km (WLTP); performance: 150 kW (204 PS) BMW i7 eDrive50: energy consumption weighted combined: 19,2 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 610 km (WLTP); performance: 335 kW (455 PS) BMW iX2 eDrive20: energy consumption weighted combined: 15,3 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 478 km (WLTP); performance: 150 kW (204 PS) MINI Cooper SE: energy consumption (NEFZ) in kWh/100km: – ; energy consumption (WLTP) in kWh/100km: 14,8 – 14,1; electrical range (WLTP) in km: 385 – 402.

This enabled the BMW brand to deliver solid sales growth in Europe in the first nine months of the year.\n\nWith sales up by over 7 percent, we are significantly outperforming the total European market and expanding our market share.\n\nThere was particularly high demand\n\nand in France, with a gain of 14 percent.\n\nAnd the BMW brand is also growing in markets such as South Korea, Australia and India.\n\nGlobal demand for our high-margin models in the upper vehicle segments remains stable. The high-performance cars of BMW M reported sales growth of two percent in the year to the end of September. This month also sees the market launch of the latest M model many fans have been waiting for: the BMW M5 Touring*.\n\nWe are constantly expanding our product range across all drive variants in line with customer demand. Our highly flexible production network allows us to tap market potential.\n\nThis applies in particular to our all-electric models. In virtually every relevant segment, the BMW Group has at least one pure electric vehicle.\n\nAcross BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, customers have a choice of more than 15 different models. This means that the BMW Group has one of the broadest ranges of fully-electric vehicles among its competitors.\n\nSales in the first nine months of the year underscore the success of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy.\n\nWhile other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – are seeing a significant decrease in sales, battery-electric vehicles remain a growth driver for us in 2024.\n\nBy the end of September, we had sold almost 300,000 BEVs – an increase of more than 19 percent compared to the same period of last year. In the third quarter, battery-electric vehicles already accounted for 19 percent of the BMW Group’s total sales.\n\nThe BMW brand's fully-electric models performed particularly well in Europe – with sales climbing 36 percent in the first nine months.\n\nGlobally, BMW’s strong BEV portfolio fed growth in deliveries of more than 22 percent. The BMW i4* remains the brand's most popular electric vehicle.\n\nIt is closely followed by the BMW iX1*, which – like the BMW i7* – recorded double-digit growth. The first all-electric BMW iX2* is also on track for success following its market launch.\n\nThe new all-electric MINI models – led by the MINI Cooper SE* – are also being very well received. With a sales increase of 54 percent, MINI BEVs experienced highly dynamic growth in the third quarter. Starting this month, the all-electric MINI Aceman* will also be available in Europe.\n\nFor the first time, MINI is also electrifying its John Cooper Works variants. The MINI John Cooper Works Electric* and MINI John Cooper Works Aceman* celebrated their premiere at the Paris Motor Show.\n\nPerformance and driving dynamics are the clear focal point in both models. From January 2025 onwards, they will captivate even the most dedicated motorsport fans.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, we anticipate another significant increase in sales of fully and partially electrified vehicles. For that reason, we see no need to modify or delay the European Union's stricter CO2 fleet targets for 2025.\n\nWe have been working intensively to meet these new fleet targets for a very long time. We are therefore confident that we will also meet the stricter requirements for 2025, as we have consistently in the last years.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that a comprehensive and critical review of CO2 fleet legislation in the EU following 2025 is absolutely essential.\n\nWhat matters most is every tonne of CO2 we can save today – not sometime in the future. This is why the use of low-CO2 fuels, such as e-fuels, E25 or HVO100, should also be revisited. These fuels could immediately improve the carbon footprint of the more than 250 million vehicles already on roads in the EU.\n\nBy 2030, all-electric vehicles will account for more than 50 percent of our total sales. The rollout of our fully-electric NEUE KLASSE will play an important part in this.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is now entering the final straight – and we are keeping this forward-looking project on track. With a new design, the next generation of electric drives and a comprehensive digital experience, the NEUE KLASSE will set completely new standards.\n\nIn just under a year, the first series-production SAV model of the NEUE KLASSE will roll off the line at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary. This will soon be followed by a sporty sedan from our main plant in Munich.\n\nPreparations for the launch are progressing well:\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we will elevate our entire vehicle portfolio to a whole new level of innovation. This will be possible thanks to our use of technology clusters, which can be integrated into all future vehicles.\n\nIn this way, all our products will benefit from the technological leaps we will achieve with the NEUE KLASSE. This applies not only to our all-electric vehicles, but across all drive technologies.\n\nOur continued, systematic implementation of technology openness also ensures that we will continue to offer the latest ICE models in the coming years.\n\nIn 2028, we will introduce another element to our drive train portfolio: the BMW Group’s first series-produced fuel cell vehicle.\n\nHydrogen will play an increasingly important role in decarbonisation. This makes vehicles with a fuel cell drive train a logical complement to established drive technologies.\n\nTo develop the new generation of fuel cell drive trains, we are deepening our long-standing cooperation with Toyota. We announced this in September together with Toyota CEO Koji Sato.\n\nThis collaboration also shares the goal of expanding infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling and electric vehicle charging.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe European automotive industry currently faces fundamentally different challenges from those we have faced in the past.\n\nWe are not dealing with a singular, overarching occurrence.\n\nInstead, we are facing a tangle of critical influencing factors that keep growing in number.\n\nIn such a phase, we do not need short-term incentives that only create a fleeting impact. What global companies truly need is a reliable and binding framework for progress and prosperity.\n\nThe introduction of tariffs on electric vehicles imported into the EU from China is just one example. Import duties do NOT make European manufacturers any more competitive.\n\nOn the contrary: They undermine the business models of companies that operate globally.\n\nAnd, since these tariffs mainly affect small electric cars built by European manufacturers, they could even impede the growth of e-mobility.\n\nMeasures like these are also inconsistent with the EU value of free trade. Free movement of goods is a key success factor for economic growth – not just within the European Union, but globally.\n\nFree trade remains a guiding principle for the BMW Group – and we will continue to advocate for it. Because protectionism always carries the risk that measures will provoke countermeasures – ultimately hurting everyone involved, rather than benefitting any of them.\n\nWe operate as a global player, making it all the more important to maintain our strategy of balanced global positioning. This applies as much to our sales and production network as to our selection of suppliers.\n\nWe continue to systematically expand our “local for local” approach – making our supply chains more resilient and improving our access to different market regions.\n\nAnd while Germany’s future as an industrial location may be questioned by some, we are making investments here.\n\nIn Irlbach-Straßkirchen in Bavaria, we are building a new assembly plant for the latest generation of high-voltage batteries. They will be used for the first time in the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nA total of five new assembly plants are under construction near our production sites worldwide, across all three major sales regions – Europe, the Americas and China.\n\nIn this way, we are already laying the foundation today for successful growth in the future.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis past quarter, we faced a series of extraordinary challenges.\n\nOne of the BMW Group’s biggest strengths is our ability to consistently find the right solutions and implement the necessary steps swiftly and efficiently.\n\nOur company maintains a robust global presence. Our strategic direction for the future is solid. We are carefully adapting our approach to changing conditions and planning for a range of scenarios.\n\nWe continue to be guided by the developments we can realistically expect to see in different regions of the world.\n\nThe fourth quarter will demonstrate that our measures – despite all the ongoing challenges – yield positive results. We therefore approach the final quarter of the current financial year with a sense of confidence.\n\nWe are striking a balance between securing short-term earnings and long-term success: This year, we are investing more than ever in new products, technologies and our plants, so that we can continue the BMW success story with the NEUE KLASSE from next year onwards.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Touring: energy consumption weighted combined: 27,6 kWh/100 km and 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery: G; weighted combined: B; fuel consumption with unloaded battery: 10,9 l/100 km (WLTP) BMW i4 eDrive40 Gran Coupé: energy consumption weighted combined: 18,6 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A BMW iX1 eDrive20: energy consumption weighted combined: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 474 km (WLTP); performance: 150 kW (204 PS) BMW i7 eDrive50: energy consumption weighted combined: 19,2 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 610 km (WLTP); performance: 335 kW (455 PS) BMW iX2 eDrive20: energy consumption weighted combined: 15,3 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 478 km (WLTP); performance: 150 kW (204 PS) MINI Cooper SE: energy consumption (NEFZ) in kWh/100km: – ; energy consumption (WLTP) in kWh/100km: 14,8 – 14,1; electrical range (WLTP) in km: 385 – 402.

We continue to steer our strategic course into the future, while avoiding short-term adjustments that could jeopardise our long-term success.\n\nOur commitment to technology openness has proven its value – and is paying off today more than ever.\n\nOur global positioning across sales, production and our supplier network secures us access to markets worldwide.\n\nBMW is a global company with a strong presence in all relevant economic regions. I regularly take the time to see this for myself. This doesn't work at a distance, but is best done when you are on the ground.\n\nSo, over the past three months, I have visited markets in all of our four sales regions – in Europe, the Americas, China and our emerging “Fourth Pillar Region”, which includes Southeast Asia and the Middle East, among others.\n\nOur global approach has often allowed us to compensate for fluctuating demand in individual markets. Of course, we are monitoring current developments in China very closely.

This weekend marks the end of the long wait for the start of the new DTM season. Motorsport Arena Oschersleben (GER) will host the first two races out of a total of 16. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Team Schubert Motorsport aim to defend their titles in the driver and team championships. The Schubert team, based in Oschersleben, will have their first home races in the DTM since the circuit returns to the DTM calendar for the first time since 2015 after the series was taken over by the ADAC.\n\nAction begins on Thursday with a test day, allowing drivers and teams to adjust their cars to the track. Schubert Motorsport is naturally familiar with their home circuit, especially from their time in the ADAC GT Masters.

With the DTM title wins for Sheldon van der Linde and Team Schubert, the BMW M4 GT3 achieved its greatest successes in the debut season of 2022. The vehicle has since proved its capability to win and secure titles on different types of race tracks and in all race formats. Consequently, we are optimistic about playing a leading role in the upcoming season with our three high-calibre BMW M works drivers who together won a total of six DTM driver titles to date. At the same time, I look forward to seeing the new BMW M4 GT4 and the BMW M2 CS Racing in action as part of the DTM’s support programme.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “For us as the Schubert team, it is probably the biggest race weekend of the season right from the start, as it takes place just five minutes away from our headquarters. Consequently, many guests will come to support us for this home game on Saturday and Sunday. Naturally, my goal is to put on a good show for these fans and hopefully achieve podium finishes. Whether that will be possible remains to be seen, as we are still not a hundred percent sure about our position with the new Pirelli tyres. We are aware that as the defending champions, we are under special pressure, but we have done everything in preparation to enter the season optimally prepared.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “My first races as a BMW M works driver in the BMW M4 GT3 – finally!

This weekend marks the end of the long wait for the start of the new DTM season. Motorsport Arena Oschersleben (GER) will host the first two races out of a total of 16. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Team Schubert Motorsport aim to defend their titles in the driver and team championships. The Schubert team, based in Oschersleben, will have their first home races in the DTM since the circuit returns to the DTM calendar for the first time since 2015 after the series was taken over by the ADAC.\n\nAction begins on Thursday with a test day, allowing drivers and teams to adjust their cars to the track. Schubert Motorsport is naturally familiar with their home circuit, especially from their time in the ADAC GT Masters. Like van der Linde, his teammate René Rast (GER) will also compete in a DTM race at Oschersleben for the first time, despite all his experience – and it will also be his first race as a BMW M works driver behind the wheel of the BMW M4 GT3. Only Marco Wittmann (GER), who competes for the new Project 1 team, has previous DTM race experience on the track.\n\nQuotes ahead of the DTM season opener:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “After experiencing several highlights at race tracks around the world from the perspective of BMW M Motorsport in the past weeks and months, we are very excited to witness the start of the new DTM season, under the leadership of the ADAC. With the DTM title wins for Sheldon van der Linde and Team Schubert, the BMW M4 GT3 achieved its greatest successes in the debut season of 2022. The vehicle has since proved its capability to win and secure titles on different types of race tracks and in all race formats. Consequently, we are optimistic about playing a leading role in the upcoming season with our three high-calibre BMW M works drivers who together won a total of six DTM driver titles to date. At the same time, I look forward to seeing the new BMW M4 GT4 and the BMW M2 CS Racing in action as part of the DTM’s support programme.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “For us as the Schubert team, it is probably the biggest race weekend of the season right from the start, as it takes place just five minutes away from our headquarters. Consequently, many guests will come to support us for this home game on Saturday and Sunday. Naturally, my goal is to put on a good show for these fans and hopefully achieve podium finishes. Whether that will be possible remains to be seen, as we are still not a hundred percent sure about our position with the new Pirelli tyres. We are aware that as the defending champions, we are under special pressure, but we have done everything in preparation to enter the season optimally prepared.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “My first races as a BMW M works driver in the BMW M4 GT3 – finally! I am very excited and looking forward to starting my new career with BMW M Motorsport at Oschersleben. However, the weekend is not only special for me, but also for the Schubert team. It’s a great thing to compete at our home race as the defending champions with the number one on Sheldon’s car. I haven’t raced in Oschersleben for a long time, but I generally have good memories of the track. I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 BMW M4 GT3, Project 1): “Finally, it’s time to get back on track! After participating in several races and racing series this year, I am now very excited to begin the DTM season at Oschersleben with BMW M Motorsport, my new team Project 1, my long-time partner Schaeffler, and the ‘Green Machine’. Oschersleben returns to the racing calendar after a long time, but I still remember my DTM races there and my early days in motorsport very well. It was in the Formula BMW that I competed in my very first single-seater races at the Motorsport Arena. For the upcoming weekend, I hope for a good season start, although we are aware that as a new team, we need to find our way at this extremely high level. We will definitely give our best for good results.“"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport, GT Racing"}]}

The African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC) is set to arrive in Marrakech following the successful completion of its first workshops with African filmmakers and visual artists in Lagos, Tangier, and Nairobi. Continuing her BMW Art Car project, the AFMAC initiative was launched in April this year by internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu, in collaboration with Emmy-nominated film producer Mehret Mandefro and BMW. As the long-term mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival (28 November – 6 December), Smeia, the exclusive importer of BMW in Morocco, together with BMW AG, will offer insights into works from AFMAC lead artists Zeresenay Berhane Mehari, Wanuri Kahiu, Jim Chuchu and The Otolith Group, as well as impressions from the workshops next to Mehretu’s BMW Art Car on the festival grounds during the opening weekend.\n\n10 years of partnership between Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, and Marrakech International Film Festival Established in 2001, the Marrakech International Film Festival aims to support and promote both the art of cinema and the film industry in Morocco. Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, has been the mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival for the past ten years enhancing each guest’s journey with elegance and distinction. Over the last two decades, the festival has evolved into a vibrant platform for creativity and exploration, celebrating the values of diversity, cultural exchange, and mutual enrichment.\n\nFor its 22nd edition the Marrakech International Film Festival celebrates world cinema with a selection of 82 films from 31 countries, presented in several sections: the Official Competition, Gala Screenings, Horizons section, the 11th Continent, Moroccan Panorama, Young Audiences and Families, and films screened in parallel with Tributes given to film personalities. The Official Competition showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature films that compete for the Étoile d’or, awarded by a jury headed this year by South Korean director and multiple award winner Bong Joon-ho. Additionally, the festival will honour Jodie Foster, Guillermo del Toro, Raouya, and Hussein Fahmi – four exceptional figures whose careers showcase the diversity and richness of cinema. Highlights of this year's festival programme include screenings of film productions such as Dead Man’s Wire (opening film/ Gala) by Gus Van Sant and Akinola Davies Jr.'s My Father's Shadow (Official Competition). All details on this year’s official selection can be found here.\n\nSmeia, BMW and AFMAC are also collaborating with the festival’s Atlas Workshops, an industry and talent development programme. As part of this partnership, Mehret Mandefro and Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will share insights into their work with the Atlas Station participants on 30 November at 12noon. The panel “Beyond the Gaze: Authentic African Stories and the Creative Journey” explores the promise and perils of authentic storytelling as part of the creative process building AFMAC. Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will talk about his creative process and explore how to protect voice and vision in a global marketplace that often requires compromise.\n\nAFMAC at Marrakech International Film FestivalAt this year’s festival edition, Julie Mehretu's BMW Art Car #20 will be showcased on the festival grounds, surrounded by an AFMAC Hub. Julie Mehretu unveiled her BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car at the Centre Pompidou in 2024, marking the first time in the collection's history that an artist developed an Art Car that goes far beyond the car as a pure art object. In collaboration with BMW and Mehret Mandefro, Mehretu launched the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), which has been hosting workshops in 2025 and 2026 across African cities such as Dakar, Lagos, and Cape Town. The initiative aims to nurture creativity and foster collaboration with emerging African artists and filmmakers.\n\n“The magic of bringing people together starts with us. AFMAC creates forums for conversations in small, critical masses and surfaces resources to take the next steps. We build on the work of our local cultural partners: They already created a grounded cultural infrastructure, showing that art is not just a nice-to-have but a must-have. The talent and cultural energy emerging from these cities is electric – culture cannot be gated, it will always find a way to be heard,“ says Mehret Mandefro, co-founder of AFMAC.\n\nThe outcomes of the AFMAC workshops will be exhibited alongside the 20th BMW Art Car at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town at the end of 2026. The presentation at the Marrakech International Film Festival offers a unique opportunity to gain first insights into the ongoing project ahead of the final exhibition. The display of Mehretu’s BMW M Hybrid V8 in Marrakech is part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary BMW Art Car Collection this year. To mark this jubilee, the tour features an exhibition programme spanning all five continents and including numerous accompanying events.\n\nThe AFMAC hub on the festival grounds in Marrakech is open to all visitors and located some meters away from the epicentre of the Film Festival Masterclasses, the Meydene theatre at M Avenue Marrakech. It offers an exclusive opportunity to explore selected works by leading artists, Wanuri Kahiu , The Otolith Group, and Zeresenay Berhane Mehari :\n\nJim Chuchu “Invocations: Release” (2015), a single-channel video work, portrays an African body navigating tradition, expectation, and self-determination, using ritualistic movement and visual metaphors to transform constraint into liberation.\n\n“Carrying Capacities” (2025) is a rhythmic visual meditation using aerial perspectives and editing to explore Earth's landscapes, cities, human activity, and environmental alteration, reflecting on the planet's ability to sustain human impact.\n\nWanuri Kahiu Through the trailer to the Sci-Fi short film “Pumzi” (2009) visitors encounter a futuristic Africa, 35 years after World War III ‘The Water War’. In a world where nature is extinct and the outside is dead, museum curator Asha defies the Maitu Council's restrictions to plant a germinating seedling outside, hoping to uncover signs of life.\n\nThe Otolith Group Inspired by the poet Rabindranath Tagore's 1921 lecture “The Message of the Forest” at Berlin's Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität—recorded on shellac at the Hotel Esplanade—the Otolith Group's eponymous work bridges nearly a century of time. The digitized recording of Tagore's voice, which envisioned the world campus he would establish that same year at Visva Bharati University in West Bengal, now speaks to ancient Banyan trees and today's students. Through separate paths of image and sound, the work connects the ancient past to the distant future of a changing planet.\n\nZeresenay Berhane MehariThrough the trailer to the feature film “Difret” visitors encounter the story of a young Ethiopian girl and a lawyer who challenge deeply-rooted cultural traditions to fight for equal rights. When 14-year-old Hirut is abducted for marriage and kills her captor in self-defense, lawyer Meaza steps in to save her from a death sentence, risking everything to confront one of Ethiopia’s oldest traditions.\n\nAfrican Film and Media Arts Collective – Past and future stationsApril 2025: Lagos, Nigeria, in partnership with Angels & MuseLead artist: Coco Fusco\n\nJuly 2025: Tangier, Morocco, in partnership with Cinematheque de TangerLead artist: Zeresenay Berhane Mehari\n\nOctober 2025: Nairobi, Kenya, in partnership with DocuboxLead artists: Jim Chuchu and Wanuri Kahiu\n\nDecember 2025: Dakar, Senegal, in partnership with Fanta Sy and Raw Material CompanyLead artist: Mati Diop\n\nJanuary 2026: Cape Town, South Africa, in partnership with Chimurenga Lead artist: The Otolith Group\n\n10 December 2026 – 15 August 2027: Final exhibition at Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art (Zeitz MOCAA), Cape Town, South Africa\n\nBiographies of the founders and lead artists Julie Mehretu is a world-renowned American artist, born in Addis Ababa in 1970.

In collaboration with BMW and Mehret Mandefro, Mehretu launched the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), which has been hosting workshops in 2025 and 2026 across African cities such as Dakar, Lagos, and Cape Town. The initiative aims to nurture creativity and foster collaboration with emerging African artists and filmmakers.\n\n“The magic of bringing people together starts with us. AFMAC creates forums for conversations in small, critical masses and surfaces resources to take the next steps. We build on the work of our local cultural partners: They already created a grounded cultural infrastructure, showing that art is not just a nice-to-have but a must-have. The talent and cultural energy emerging from these cities is electric – culture cannot be gated, it will always find a way to be heard,“ says Mehret Mandefro, co-founder of AFMAC.\n\nThe outcomes of the AFMAC workshops will be exhibited alongside the 20th BMW Art Car at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town at the end of 2026.

The digitized recording of Tagore's voice, which envisioned the world campus he would establish that same year at Visva Bharati University in West Bengal, now speaks to ancient Banyan trees and today's students.

Commitment to a brand can be expressed in a variety of ways. MINI fans and customers can also underline this outside of their own vehicle in everyday life: with the new MINI Lifestyle Collection 2024, they are always and everywhere connected with their favourite brand. The collection combines brand-typical style and functionality. Graphic details of the MINI Cooper design characterise the new MINI lifestyle products. A high proportion of reclaimed materials characterises the responsible production of the new product line. For example, production waste is collected and reclaimed in the same way as nylon and PET.\n\nNew textiles for the MINI Lifestyle Collection 2024. The main motifs of the new collection are based on the front of the new MINI Cooper. One of the many highlights is the MINI Car Face Detail T-shirt with a stylised graphic of the typical MINI round headlight. If you like it particularly comfortable, slip into the MINI Outline Print Hoodie. The outline of the new MINI Cooper headlights and radiator grille playfully stretches across the front and back of the hoodie.\n\nThe colour concept for the MINI Lifestyle Collection 2024 is based on the contrasting colour scheme of the new MINI family. For example, the new MINI Caps combine the bright shade of Rebel Red with the new Vibrant Silver through colour blocking.\n\nAll garments are made from a mix of organic and recycled cotton or are made from 100% organic cotton. The entire fashion collection is produced in Portugal.\n\nLong-lasting companions for everyday life and travelling.

After missing two race weekends due to his severe crash at Magny-Cours (FRA), Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) made an impressive return. The BMW Motorrad factory rider made his comeback in the tenth round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) – both on track and on the podium. After not still being able to compete the previous week at Cremona (ITA) due to a mild pneumothorax, Razgatlioglu was back to his usual strength on his ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team BMW M 1000 RR, finishing second in all three races. That extended his lead in the championship standings, now giving him a 39-point advantage. Saturday even saw a double podium for the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family as Garrett Gerloff (USA) from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, who had another strong weekend in Spain, finished third behind Razgatlioglu.\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED / ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) and Scott Redding (GBR / Bonovo action BMW Racing Team) also collected valuable points at MotorLand Aragón.\n\nRace one on Saturday afternoon turned into a real thriller, ending with BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s first WorldSBK double podium in three years. The race was red-flagged on the first lap due to track conditions. After the restart, the nearly 28,000 fans witnessed 17 laps of action-packed racing. At the front, a group battled fiercely for the lead and podium spots. Razgatlioglu, starting from fifth, and van der Mark, coming from eleventh, were right in the mix. Van der Mark fell back mid-race, but Gerloff, after an excellent comeback, was now in the thick of things. Starting from tenth, Gerloff climbed to third by lap nine and was hunting down the leaders. In the following laps, Razgatlioglu and Gerloff swapped second place several times, putting pressure on the race leader, Andrea Iannone (ITA / Ducati). After a nail-biting finish, Razgatlioglu finished second, and Gerloff took third, both stepping onto the podium together. Van der Mark finished ninth. Redding, who was pushed off track at the start and rejoined the race in 17th, fought his way back to 11th.\n\nSunday morning’s Superpole Race was no less thrilling. This time, a three-way battle for the lead went down to the wire. Razgatlioglu moved into second in lap two and battled with the two Ducati factory riders, Nicolo Bulega (ITA) and Alvaro Bautista (ESP). After several lead changes, the race was decided in the final moments, with Razgatlioglu securing second place for his second podium since his comeback. Gerloff aimed to improve his grid position for race two, which he successfully did by finishing fifth. Van der Mark impressed with another comeback, recovering from 18th at the start to finish eighth. Like Razgatlioglu and Gerloff, he also improved his starting position. Redding ensured all four BMW M 1000 RRs finished in the top ten, missing out on ninth by just two-tenths of a second to finish tenth.\n\nIn Sunday afternoon’s second main race, Bautista and Razgatlioglu sprinted away from the field. The pair broke multiple lap records while fighting for the win, with Razgatlioglu sticking closely to Bautista’s rear, waiting for his chance. However, in the closing stages, Razgatlioglu had to drop back slightly but still finished second for the third time during his comeback weekend. Gerloff was again in the fight for the podium and finished fifth. Van der Mark raced with the lead group early on and crossed the finish line in seventh after 18 laps. Redding wrapped up his weekend with an 11th place finish.\n\nThe WorldSBK now takes a one-week break before heading to the penultimate round of the season at Estoril, Portugal, from 11th to 13th. The season finale will be held just one week later at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP).\n\nReactions after the MotorLand Aragón round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another exciting weekend, one that can definitely be summed up with the word ‘comeback.’ You really have to give Toprak credit for the mental strength he’s shown after coming back from such a serious crash. In my eyes, he had a perfect weekend considering that he’s just come out of an injury break. He collected a lot of points, extended his lead in every race, and was always ahead of his title rival Nicolo Bulega. I think we can be very happy with that. Now we’re already preparing for the next two race weekends. On Mickey’s side of the garage, you could see how he became more comfortable with the bike as the weekend progressed. He had some really good moments in the race but also a bit of bad luck. But overall, the pace was there.\n\nWith Garrett, the upward trend is clear. He had a very good race weekend, especially Saturday with his podium! You really have to highlight the hard but fair fight with Toprak. It was great to see how the BMW riders treated each other fairly on the track and brought out the best for BMW together. Scott’s weekend was better overall than the previous one. He managed to achieve some better results and continues to get full support to set up the bike as best as possible for the races.\n\nOur conclusion: We are back! The championship fight is fully on again, and we’re going into the last two race weekends with a good points cushion. We’re looking forward to Estoril!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 5 / R01: 2 / SP Race: 2 / R02: 2): “I am happy because I did an incredibly good job this weekend and I enjoyed being back on my bike. I was riding more than 100 percent. The Superpole race today was really fun because for the first time this weekend I felt that the bike was really good. The bike was stopping and turning like I wanted and the feeling was much better. I was fighting with Bulega and I was not expecting that Bautista would attack in the chicane. Anyway, I was very close to the win. Alvaro is always very strong here, but not only him but all Ducatis. In race two, I again did my best to battle with him but on the last laps my rear tyre started to drop, and on the last laps, the Ducatis had more grip than the other bikes. And Alvaro was really pushing hard so I thought, okay, I settle for second position as it was impossible to catch him. Especially in the long corners, he had a big advantage. He did an incredible job, it looks like he has come back. I am happy for him. Now we have two more rounds and I will focus now on Estoril. I need to win there. Physically I only feel some muscle pain now but this is normal after this time without training. Especially the last race was very hard because the pace was very strong, everyone was pushing hard. On the bike, I am feeling good and I just need some training now. When we come to Estoril it will be much better because the feeling is improving every day. In general I am happy. Thinking of Estoril, maybe we can be World Champions there but at the moment I just focus on winning there because I love Estoril and after many wins, second position is a bit difficult for me. I hope that we will come back at Estoril.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 10 / R01: 3 / SP Race: 5 / R02: 5): “This was probably the best weekend I’ve had for a very long time. That’s definitely really positive. I’m nevertheless a bit disappointed because I thought I would have a bit more pace today to be able to stay in third. It feels like for some reason I was lacking a bit of pace compared to Nicolo, Alvaro and Toprak. They really just had a super fast pace today. I did everything that I could, I had a great battle with Iannone, but on the last lap I missed the shift, that didn’t help me at all. All in all it was a super good weekend with always being in the top five except of Superpole. I was feeling really comfortable on the bike in the last races and I have the feeling I am able to really push. All I needed was that the bike gets predictable for me and that I can ride a bit beyond it, so a lot of things came together with me, the bike and the team and it feels good. Now I’m looking forward to go to Estoril - I think it’s a good track for the BMWs and I really like the track, it has a great flow.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 11 / R01: 9 / SP Race: 8 / R02: 7): “The weekend started pretty tough, we struggled somehow on Friday, but Saturday went already much better. Superpole was ok. I think I could have done a little better lap, but P11 was not too bad. In race one, I had a really good start but unfortunately I couldn’t maintain the pace and dropped back a lot. So it was a shame because I was in some nice battles, and finished 9th in the first race. During the Superpole race, I had an ok start but I had two overtakes where I went wide, nearly off track. So I had to come from almost last. Finishing in the top ten has shown that I had a good pace. It wasn’t bad though but I was a little bit angry because I lost a lot of time at the beginning. Anyways, I was ready for race two and I had a fantastic start but struggled with the front of the bike at the beginning of the race. That’s why I couldn’t really stay with the guys in front of me. After a couple of laps I found a good rhythm to avoid the problems and I had a nice and consistent pace. I was really fast, so we managed to get some good points. But for Estoril for sure we want more.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 14 / R01: 11 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 11): “My weekend was pretty good. Getting some feeling with the bike on Friday and in the race on Saturday gave me some confidence. The warm up was reasonably good. In the Superpole race, I was battling for ninth position, but didn’t quite get it. But I was happy enough for tenth at this moment, even though I really wanted to be in the top nine. In race two I had a good start and a clean first lap and felt pretty good. The pace was faster this afternoon, but I just missed actually something. Not the pace itself, I was riding fast, strong, consistent but I just didn’t have the pace of the group in front. Also again this weekend, I was struggling a little bit to overtake without costing me and the other rider too much time. Overall I’m happy, because coming into this weekend I think me and everybody else thought it was going to be a really hard weekend for me and honestly I expected to be fighting in 15th position this weekend, because Aragón has been very difficult for me in the past. But the team and BMW have done a good job to put a package underneath me that I could build confidence with this weekend and to come away with some for me reasonable results here at Aragón. Now I can go home and see my son.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After missing two race weekends due to his severe crash at Magny-Cours (FRA), Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) made an impressive return.

At the front, a group battled fiercely for the lead and podium spots. Razgatlioglu, starting from fifth, and van der Mark, coming from eleventh, were right in the mix. Van der Mark fell back mid-race, but Gerloff, after an excellent comeback, was now in the thick of things. Starting from tenth, Gerloff climbed to third by lap nine and was hunting down the leaders. In the following laps, Razgatlioglu and Gerloff swapped second place several times, putting pressure on the race leader, Andrea Iannone (ITA / Ducati). After a nail-biting finish, Razgatlioglu finished second, and Gerloff took third, both stepping onto the podium together. Van der Mark finished ninth. Redding, who was pushed off track at the start and rejoined the race in 17th, fought his way back to 11th.\n\nSunday morning’s Superpole Race was no less thrilling. This time, a three-way battle for the lead went down to the wire. Razgatlioglu moved into second in lap two and battled with the two Ducati factory riders, Nicolo Bulega (ITA) and Alvaro Bautista (ESP). After several lead changes, the race was decided in the final moments, with Razgatlioglu securing second place for his second podium since his comeback. Gerloff aimed to improve his grid position for race two, which he successfully did by finishing fifth. Van der Mark impressed with another comeback, recovering from 18th at the start to finish eighth. Like Razgatlioglu and Gerloff, he also improved his starting position. Redding ensured all four BMW M 1000 RRs finished in the top ten, missing out on ninth by just two-tenths of a second to finish tenth.\n\nIn Sunday afternoon’s second main race, Bautista and Razgatlioglu sprinted away from the field. The pair broke multiple lap records while fighting for the win, with Razgatlioglu sticking closely to Bautista’s rear, waiting for his chance. However, in the closing stages, Razgatlioglu had to drop back slightly but still finished second for the third time during his comeback weekend. Gerloff was again in the fight for the podium and finished fifth. Van der Mark raced with the lead group early on and crossed the finish line in seventh after 18 laps. Redding wrapped up his weekend with an 11th place finish.\n\nThe WorldSBK now takes a one-week break before heading to the penultimate round of the season at Estoril, Portugal, from 11th to 13th. The season finale will be held just one week later at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP).\n\nReactions after the MotorLand Aragón round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another exciting weekend, one that can definitely be summed up with the word ‘comeback.’ You really have to give Toprak credit for the mental strength he’s shown after coming back from such a serious crash. In my eyes, he had a perfect weekend considering that he’s just come out of an injury break. He collected a lot of points, extended his lead in every race, and was always ahead of his title rival Nicolo Bulega. I think we can be very happy with that. Now we’re already preparing for the next two race weekends. On Mickey’s side of the garage, you could see how he became more comfortable with the bike as the weekend progressed. He had some really good moments in the race but also a bit of bad luck. But overall, the pace was there.\n\nWith Garrett, the upward trend is clear. He had a very good race weekend, especially Saturday with his podium! You really have to highlight the hard but fair fight with Toprak. It was great to see how the BMW riders treated each other fairly on the track and brought out the best for BMW together. Scott’s weekend was better overall than the previous one. He managed to achieve some better results and continues to get full support to set up the bike as best as possible for the races.\n\nOur conclusion: We are back! The championship fight is fully on again, and we’re going into the last two race weekends with a good points cushion. We’re looking forward to Estoril!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 5 / R01: 2 / SP Race: 2 / R02: 2): “I am happy because I did an incredibly good job this weekend and I enjoyed being back on my bike. I was riding more than 100 percent. The Superpole race today was really fun because for the first time this weekend I felt that the bike was really good. The bike was stopping and turning like I wanted and the feeling was much better. I was fighting with Bulega and I was not expecting that Bautista would attack in the chicane. Anyway, I was very close to the win. Alvaro is always very strong here, but not only him but all Ducatis. In race two, I again did my best to battle with him but on the last laps my rear tyre started to drop, and on the last laps, the Ducatis had more grip than the other bikes. And Alvaro was really pushing hard so I thought, okay, I settle for second position as it was impossible to catch him. Especially in the long corners, he had a big advantage. He did an incredible job, it looks like he has come back. I am happy for him. Now we have two more rounds and I will focus now on Estoril. I need to win there. Physically I only feel some muscle pain now but this is normal after this time without training. Especially the last race was very hard because the pace was very strong, everyone was pushing hard. On the bike, I am feeling good and I just need some training now. When we come to Estoril it will be much better because the feeling is improving every day. In general I am happy. Thinking of Estoril, maybe we can be World Champions there but at the moment I just focus on winning there because I love Estoril and after many wins, second position is a bit difficult for me. I hope that we will come back at Estoril.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 10 / R01: 3 / SP Race: 5 / R02: 5): “This was probably the best weekend I’ve had for a very long time. That’s definitely really positive. I’m nevertheless a bit disappointed because I thought I would have a bit more pace today to be able to stay in third. It feels like for some reason I was lacking a bit of pace compared to Nicolo, Alvaro and Toprak. They really just had a super fast pace today. I did everything that I could, I had a great battle with Iannone, but on the last lap I missed the shift, that didn’t help me at all. All in all it was a super good weekend with always being in the top five except of Superpole. I was feeling really comfortable on the bike in the last races and I have the feeling I am able to really push. All I needed was that the bike gets predictable for me and that I can ride a bit beyond it, so a lot of things came together with me, the bike and the team and it feels good. Now I’m looking forward to go to Estoril - I think it’s a good track for the BMWs and I really like the track, it has a great flow.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 11 / R01: 9 / SP Race: 8 / R02: 7): “The weekend started pretty tough, we struggled somehow on Friday, but Saturday went already much better. Superpole was ok. I think I could have done a little better lap, but P11 was not too bad. In race one, I had a really good start but unfortunately I couldn’t maintain the pace and dropped back a lot. So it was a shame because I was in some nice battles, and finished 9th in the first race. During the Superpole race, I had an ok start but I had two overtakes where I went wide, nearly off track. So I had to come from almost last. Finishing in the top ten has shown that I had a good pace. It wasn’t bad though but I was a little bit angry because I lost a lot of time at the beginning. Anyways, I was ready for race two and I had a fantastic start but struggled with the front of the bike at the beginning of the race. That’s why I couldn’t really stay with the guys in front of me. After a couple of laps I found a good rhythm to avoid the problems and I had a nice and consistent pace. I was really fast, so we managed to get some good points. But for Estoril for sure we want more.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 14 / R01: 11 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 11): “My weekend was pretty good. Getting some feeling with the bike on Friday and in the race on Saturday gave me some confidence. The warm up was reasonably good. In the Superpole race, I was battling for ninth position, but didn’t quite get it. But I was happy enough for tenth at this moment, even though I really wanted to be in the top nine. In race two I had a good start and a clean first lap and felt pretty good. The pace was faster this afternoon, but I just missed actually something. Not the pace itself, I was riding fast, strong, consistent but I just didn’t have the pace of the group in front. Also again this weekend, I was struggling a little bit to overtake without costing me and the other rider too much time. Overall I’m happy, because coming into this weekend I think me and everybody else thought it was going to be a really hard weekend for me and honestly I expected to be fighting in 15th position this weekend, because Aragón has been very difficult for me in the past. But the team and BMW have done a good job to put a package underneath me that I could build confidence with this weekend and to come away with some for me reasonable results here at Aragón. Now I can go home and see my son.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "WorldSBK Aragón: Great comeback and celebrated podium finishes."}]}

But the team and BMW have done a good job to put a package underneath me that I could build confidence with this weekend and to come away with some for me reasonable results here at Aragón. Now I can go home and see my son.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

As in the past and present, so doubtless in the future too: a driver’s licence represents far more than just permission to take a car for a spin out on the road. Indeed, it is the key to myriad experiences, memories and character-forming moments. And even when the day inevitably comes that you can no longer responsibly pilot a vehicle on a public highway and take the decision to give up your licence, one thing will live on: the joy of driving that unites the generations. This is the message behind a short film that will touch the soul.\n\nCelebrating its premiere today on BMW’s social media channels under the banner “Freude forever”, the film shows in heart-warming scenes how the shared experience of personal mobility can become a formative part of a family’s history. Authentic storytelling and relatable characters take centre stage. The film tells the story of 85-year-old Robert, who realises it is time to hang up his driving gloves from good. The emotions this stirs are felt not only by him but also by his son Christopher, who goes with him to hand in his license at the relevant offices. The drive back in Christopher’s all-electric BMW i4 turns into a journey through the past and the present – and a very special experience full of happy memories together.\n\nThe setting for the opening scene of the 90-second festive film is austere, to say the least: a cold, grey waiting room, the monotonous ticking of a wall clock. Only a Christmas tree in the background attempts to add a little warmth. The dejected look on Robert’s face tells you that the time has come. Christopher tries in vain to cheer him up (“It’s only a piece of a plastic, you know...”). But for Robert, the piece of plastic he’s handing over at the counter is an expression of freedom and the pure joy of driving. The mood in the car on the way home is suitably melancholic – until Christopher suddenly turns off the road.\n\nThe two men draw up at the gates of a location at first unknown. On Christopher’s signal, a security guard opens the barrier. It turns out they are now in their company’s car park. Robert immediately recalls the place he taught his son to drive almost 40 years ago. And in a reversal of roles, Christopher invites his father to take the wheel of his BMW one final time.\n\nNow there’s a flashback to the 1980s, Robert swapping places with Christopher so his then 18-year-old son can take the controls of his BMW 3 Series. Back in the here and now, as Robert presses down on the accelerator of the BMW i4 and the all-electric gran coupé whirs dynamically into action, the past and present merge into a visually stunning spectacle. Robert’s joyful memories of car journeys with his son play out in his mind’s eye: the young Christopher fast asleep on night-time trips, unforgettable family holidays, all those miles around the country to cheer on his sporting exploits, collecting him from parties, driving him to his first date. In a dramatic climax, Robert brings the car to a halt and pauses for a moment: now he’s ready to vacate the driver’s seat for good. After all, the feeling of joy will endure forever.\n\nThe idea for this engrossing film came from creative/advertising agency Jung von Matt for THE GAME. Produced in collaboration with BMW Marketing, the film lasts around 90 seconds and will be available to view across the BMW brand’s social media channels – on YouTube, LinkedIn and Instagram.

Davis Bryant had a sensational day at the BMW International Open. The American, who is playing his first season on the DP World Tour, started on the 10th hole, made a birdie on the 11th, and then aced the 12th hole (Par 3, 166 yards). He would go on to make eight more birdies, finishing the second round at 12 under par to take the lead. On an otherwise perfect day, the 25-year-old might only regret making his ace on the “wrong” hole. This year’s hole-in-one prize – a BMW M5 Touring – is awarded for an ace on the 17th hole, which remains in play over the weekend.\n\nClosest behind Bryant are Kristoffer Reitan (NOR, -10), along with Yuto Katsuragawa (JPN), Daniel Brown (ENG), and Jordan Smith (ENG), all at -9. “I honestly don’t know what happened today. The hole-in-one really got things going – that’s always incredibly cool,” said Bryant. “I’m just very proud of how I executed everything, stuck to my process, and holed some key putts. That was a big factor. The spark really lit today – and then you just ride that momentum.”\n\nBryant’s ace – contributing to making him the first American since John Daly (2001) who could potentially win the BMW International Open – was one of 28 eagles recorded on Friday. For every eagle made during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group is donating €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint initiative aims to equip children and youth with key life skills in movement, nutrition, and personal development. Heading into the weekend, the donation total already stands at €44,000.\n\nWhile Bryant and Reitan have created a slight gap, the leaderboard remains tightly packed, promising an exciting weekend of golf. A total of 68 players made the cut – including seven Germans. Among the most promising are Marcel Siem (-7, T10), Marcel Schneider, Matti Schmid, and the sensationally performing amateur Tim Wiedemeyer (all -6, T15).\n\nSiem said: “I’m very happy. Apart from the 9th hole, I took advantage of all the chances I had. All in all, I’m really satisfied with my 6-under round today. I don’t think much more was possible – I really got the maximum out of it. My goal is to start the weekend confidently and go at the flags more aggressively when I’m in the fairway. That’s my game plan.”\n\nSchneider was also pleased with his performance: “Today went better than yesterday. The putter got really hot at times. Overall, the ball-striking was better. It wasn’t perfect yet, but overall, I’m satisfied. The four early birdies definitely gave me a push. My plan is to keep playing well, attack the course, and hit a lot of greens. I’ll take it shot by shot and see where that gets me.”\n\nAmateur Tim Wiedemeyer has been playing impressive golf this week. In his hometown, the 20-year-old followed up his even-par opening round with a 66 today and said: “I’m very happy. Six under par is pretty good. I tried to hit a lot of fairways and greens. And when the putter gets hot, you shoot a good score. The support – especially on the back nine – was really cool. It felt more like an evening round with friends. That definitely helped my game today. Now, I just want to have fun. The cut is made – let’s see what happens and enjoy it.”\n\nFor Martin Kaymer (-4, T37), the dream of a second win in Munich after 2008 is still alive – albeit with a steep task ahead, sitting seven shots behind the leader. The two-time Major champion said: “Overall, I was satisfied with my game and hit a lot of good shots, but I didn’t take advantage of the par-5s. Those are the real birdie chances this week, and I missed out there. On this course – especially if the weather is good – you can really go low. Marcel proved that today. I know what I need to do tomorrow and hope to shoot a good round to still be in contention on Sunday.”\n\nCompleting the group of Germans playing on the weekend are Yannik Paul (-4, T37) and Hurly Long (-3, T53).

The American, who is playing his first season on the DP World Tour, started on the 10th hole, made a birdie on the 11th, and then aced the 12th hole (Par 3, 166 yards). He would go on to make eight more birdies, finishing the second round at 12 under par to take the lead. On an otherwise perfect day, the 25-year-old might only regret making his ace on the “wrong” hole. This year’s hole-in-one prize – a BMW M5 Touring – is awarded for an ace on the 17th hole, which remains in play over the weekend.\n\nClosest behind Bryant are Kristoffer Reitan (NOR, -10), along with Yuto Katsuragawa (JPN), Daniel Brown (ENG), and Jordan Smith (ENG), all at -9. “I honestly don’t know what happened today. The hole-in-one really got things going – that’s always incredibly cool,” said Bryant. “I’m just very proud of how I executed everything, stuck to my process, and holed some key putts. That was a big factor. The spark really lit today – and then you just ride that momentum.”\n\nBryant’s ace – contributing to making him the first American since John Daly (2001) who could potentially win the BMW International Open – was one of 28 eagles recorded on Friday. For every eagle made during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group is donating €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint initiative aims to equip children and youth with key life skills in movement, nutrition, and personal development. Heading into the weekend, the donation total already stands at €44,000.\n\nWhile Bryant and Reitan have created a slight gap, the leaderboard remains tightly packed, promising an exciting weekend of golf. A total of 68 players made the cut – including seven Germans. Among the most promising are Marcel Siem (-7, T10), Marcel Schneider, Matti Schmid, and the sensationally performing amateur Tim Wiedemeyer (all -6, T15).\n\nSiem said: “I’m very happy. Apart from the 9th hole, I took advantage of all the chances I had. All in all, I’m really satisfied with my 6-under round today. I don’t think much more was possible – I really got the maximum out of it. My goal is to start the weekend confidently and go at the flags more aggressively when I’m in the fairway. That’s my game plan.”\n\nSchneider was also pleased with his performance: “Today went better than yesterday. The putter got really hot at times. Overall, the ball-striking was better. It wasn’t perfect yet, but overall, I’m satisfied. The four early birdies definitely gave me a push. My plan is to keep playing well, attack the course, and hit a lot of greens. I’ll take it shot by shot and see where that gets me.”\n\nAmateur Tim Wiedemeyer has been playing impressive golf this week. In his hometown, the 20-year-old followed up his even-par opening round with a 66 today and said: “I’m very happy. Six under par is pretty good. I tried to hit a lot of fairways and greens. And when the putter gets hot, you shoot a good score. The support – especially on the back nine – was really cool. It felt more like an evening round with friends. That definitely helped my game today. Now, I just want to have fun. The cut is made – let’s see what happens and enjoy it.”\n\nFor Martin Kaymer (-4, T37), the dream of a second win in Munich after 2008 is still alive – albeit with a steep task ahead, sitting seven shots behind the leader. The two-time Major champion said: “Overall, I was satisfied with my game and hit a lot of good shots, but I didn’t take advantage of the par-5s. Those are the real birdie chances this week, and I missed out there. On this course – especially if the weather is good – you can really go low. Marcel proved that today. I know what I need to do tomorrow and hope to shoot a good round to still be in contention on Sunday.”\n\nCompleting the group of Germans playing on the weekend are Yannik Paul (-4, T37) and Hurly Long (-3, T53). Missing the cut (-3) were defending champion Ewen Ferguson (SCO), Masters champion Patrick Reed (USA), and Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald (ENG).\n\nFull tee times for round three are attached."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Golf, BMW International Open"}]}

BMW Group Plant Steyr is switching entirely to district heating for warmth: in regular operations the Austrian engine facility now no longer uses natural gas, relying instead on heat from a nearby biomass powerplant. In a symbolic act, Milan Nedeljković, Board Member for Production at BMW AG, and Arnold Schwarzenegger turned on the new power supply. The change of energy source marks yet another step in the BMW Group’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nMilan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production: “We are optimising the carbon footprint of all our production facilities worldwide, using innovative technologies and the potential of the local area to generate energy from fossil fuel-free sources. Today, we are setting a new milestone here in Steyr.”\n\nConsistent reductions in energy consumption\n\nBMW Group Plant Steyr uses around 250 gigawatt hours of energy a year – enough to power about 59,000 homes. Over the last few years, energy consumption has fallen steadily: “Since 2006 we have succeeded in almost halving the amount of energy we use per engine,” explained Plant Director Klaus von Moltke.\n\nHeat supplies play a particularly important role in all of this: “The plant was first connected to the district heating grid in 2012. Since then, there have been multiple expansions,” Klaus von Moltke continued. The transition to purely district heating was expected to reach completion at the turn of the year 2024-2025 but has now been realised two and a half months earlier.\n\nWhere the heat comes from: regional district heating from wood chips\n\nThe switch would not have been possible without a strong partner in the region: BMW Group Plant Steyr now sources its heat from the biomass powerplant of Fernwärme Steyr, just under a kilometre away. This is operated by the state’s two energy providers – Energie AG Oberösterreich Erzeugung GmbH and EVN Wärme GmbH – in their joint subsidiary, Bioenergie Steyr GmbH. To provide the heat energy that Plant Steyr needs, an additional heat generation plant with a 10-megawatt biomass boiler is being erected at the site. So, Plant Steyr will source its heat from renewable resources: wood chips from the surrounding forests.\n\nKlaus von Moltke summarised the situation saying: “By switching to 100 percent heat from regenerative biomass, we are taking a major step today. Our plant now sources both its electricity and its heat for regular operations from renewables.”\n\nToday’s symbolic energy switch took place on stage as more than a thousand employees looked on. In his keynote speech Arnold Schwarzenegger called on everyone present to act on climate change. He then shut down the plant’s gas supply. Milan Nedeljković, Board Member for Production at BMW AG, then symbolically turned on the final expansion to the district heating supply.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger then joined Klaus von Moltke and Milan Nedeljcović for a tour of the training and education centre, engine assembly and BMW Group Plant Steyr’s recently opened electric motor production line, chatting with employees as he went."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Green electricity, and district heating from locally sourced wood chips +++ Announced for 2025, introduced ahead of schedule in September 2024 +++ Arnold Schwarzenegger and BMW Board Member for Production perform symbolic energy switch +++"}]}

The BMW Museum in Munich is using a special exhibition taking place as part of the international BMW Art Car World Tour to celebrate the 50-year anniversary of both the legendary BMW Art Car Collection and the iconic BMW 3 Series. The exhibition will open its doors to visitors from 17 June, hot on the heels of the Le Mans 24 Hours race weekend. Fittingly, it was at Le Mans in 1975 that the first BMW Art Car – created by Alexander Calder – staged its glittering premiere. The exhibition, which runs until 1 February 2026, will see the BMW Museum present a trio of Art Cars based on the BMW 3 Series: Sandro Chia’s BMW M3 GTR and the BMW M3 (Group A) cars designed by Michael Jagamara Nelson and Ken Done respectively. The exhibition at the BMW Museum – the home of the BMW Art Cars when they are not on display at destinations around the globe – is one of the attractions of the ongoing BMW Art Car World Tour, the largest exhibition project yet in the 50-year history of the collection. The Tour has so far visited 12 markets on five continents, and will continue to showcase the legendary BMW Art Cars across numerous art and car platforms, and at institutes worldwide, over the coming year. The BMW Museum will use the special exhibition to provide insights into the artistic brilliance and history of the BMW Art Car Collection, as well as inviting visitors to explore the technical excellence of the 3 Series and the innovative power of the BMW brand. 50 years of driving pleasure: the BMW 3 Series Since it first hit the roads in 1975, the BMW 3 Series has served as a byword for driving pleasure and a cornerstone for the success of BMW. Across five decades, it has reimagined the concept of the sports sedan, set new standards for performance and put smiles on the faces of millions of drivers around the world. From the groundbreaking first generation to today’s innovative models, the 3 Series has been an enduring, style-defining feature of the automotive landscape. 50 years of “rolling sculptures”: the BMW Art Car CollectionSince 1975, renowned artists from countries the world over have gone to work creating BMW Art Cars. The idea was the brainchild of French racing driver and art lover Hervé Poulain, who teamed up with BMW’s then Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch to invite friend and artist Alexander Calder to paint a design onto a car. The result was a BMW 3.0 CSL that competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975, becoming a darling of the crowd – and marking the birth of the BMW Art Car Collection. Famous names including Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer and Ólafur Elíasson have since added further BMW Art Cars bearing their own individual style to the collection. More recently, the American John Baldessari and Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei used the BMW M6 GTLM and BMW M6 GT3 respectively as a canvas for their takes on the BMW Art Car concept in 2016 and 2017. They therefore joined Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu in applying their creativity to dynamic racing cars in the last 15 years. BMW Art Cars at the BMW Museum from 17 June BMW M3 Group A by Ken Done (1989): Australian artist Ken Done created a vibrant and richly coloured design that captures the energy and dynamism of motor racing. His work represents a homage to the speed and power of the BMW M3. “It was a great honour to be asked to be part of this fabulous Art Car collection. I wanted to express the joy of speed and the brilliance of the machine itself.” Ken Done BMW M3 Group A by Michael Jagamara Nelson (1989):Michael Jagamara Nelson, also from Australia, brought the traditions of Aboriginal art to the bodywork of the BMW M3. His complex motifs using dot painting techniques tell Dreaming stories that are deeply rooted in the culture of his people. “A car is a landscape as it would be seen from a plane – I have included water, the kangaroo and the opossum.” Michael Jagamara Nelson BMW M3 GTR by Sandro Chia (1992): Italian artist Sandro Chia transformed a BMW M3 GTR into a painting on wheels that depicts human figures and emotions in vivid colours. His work symbolises the connection between man and machine, and invites us to reflect on the role of the car in modern society. “I have created both a picture and a world. Everything that is looked at closely turns into a face. A face is a focus, a focus of life and the world.” Sandro Chia The 10th BMW Art Car, a BMW 730i designed by Spanish artist César Manrique in 1990, is also on show at the BMW Museum as part of its permanent exhibition.

The anniversary weekend in #Sebring (USA), celebrating the 50th birthday of #BMW of North America, brought both highlights and setbacks for BMW M Motorsport. The 73rd edition of the famous Twelve Hours of #Sebring marked the second round of the #IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). As at the season opener in Daytona (USA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 of the BMW M Team RLL secured the pole position. In the race itself, the #24 fell far back due to an unavoidable collision. The #25 sister car finished fifth. The new BMW #M4 GT3 EVO celebrated a double podium in the GTD PRO class, with the two Paul Miller Racing cars taking second and third places. Additionally, there was a first victory for the new BMW M4 GT4 EVO in Sebring .\n\nFrom P10 on the grid, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER), and Robin Frijns (NED) in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 consistently moved forward. After a final yellow phase about 45 minutes before the end, Frijns was in sixth place and managed to gain one more position in the closing minutes.\n\nIn the pole car with number 24, Vanthoor, Philipp Eng (AUT), and Kevin Magnussen (DEN) started a comeback after a drive-through penalty and made their way back to the front of the field. However, about three hours before the end, there was a setback. The BMW M Hybrid V8 was hit on the right rear by another car after a pit stop. Magnussen initially returned to the track, but the car was so severely damaged that a lengthy repair was necessary. Only after more than an hour could the #24 crew rejoin the action and was classified twelfth in the GTP class.\n\nThe two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL have been sporting a special anniversary livery since this weekend in Sebring. Exactly 50 years ago, on 15th March 1975, BMW of North America was founded. A few days later, with the Sebring victory of the BMW 3.0 CSL, which was displayed over the weekend, came the first triumph of BMW Motorsport in North America. Jochen Neerpasch, co-founder and first CEO of BMW Motorsport GmbH, and Brian Redman (USA), Sebring winner of 1975, were also present at the anniversary weekend.\n\nGTD PRO: Paul Miller Racing celebrates a double podium.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT3 EVO added two more podium places to its already impressive success series in its debut season. The two Paul Miller Racing cars took second and third places in the GTD PRO class. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Jesse Krohn (FIN) narrowly edged out their teammates Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, and Connor De Phillippi (all USA). In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO finished sixth.\n\nFirst victory for the new BMW M4 GT4 EVO.\n\nAlready on Friday, a two-hour race of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge was on the schedule in Sebring. The new BMW M4 GT4 EVO is also in its debut season, and the BMW M Motorsport teams made a big impression with the new customer racing car in Sebring. The team from CarBahn Racing w/ Peregrine Racing achieved the first victory for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO with drivers Sean McAlister and Jeff Westphal (both USA). Dillon Machavern and Francis Selldorff (both USA) also reached the podium with Turner Motorsport, finishing third. Just behind them, the BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Auto Technic Racing, driven by Austin Krainz (USA) and Steven McAleer (GBR), finished fourth.\n\nComments after the 12h Sebring:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The start into the Sebring weekend was very positive with the pole position by Dries Vanthoor. Unfortunately, the race itself in the GTP category was disappointing – we have to be honest. Car number 24 managed to fight back to the front after the initial penalty but was ultimately taken out of the race by an unsafe release by a competitor. After the accident, a lengthy repair was necessary, and all chances for a good result were taken away. Car number 25 also didn't have a completely error-free race. In the end, it managed to finish fifth, but that is obviously not what we had hoped for after the good performance of our BMW M Hybrid V8 in qualifying. However, we are now looking forward, as our cars were reliable and performed well. The double podium by Paul Miller Racing with the two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs in second and third places in the GTD PRO is definitely pleasing. It's a great result at the 12 Hours of Sebring, and I am very happy for the whole team and the drivers. Additionally, there was a first victory to celebrate in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge race for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. Congratulations to CarBahn Racing w/ Peregrine Racing and also to Turner Motorsport for the first podium with our new GT4.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 5th place): “It was a weekend of mixed feelings. On one hand, we were overjoyed after qualifying about the pole position for car number 24. This shows that we have a car that is extremely good in qualifying for one lap. Unfortunately, the race didn't go as well. It looked good for a while, we worked our way back to the front and were on course for a podium. But in the end, it was 'only' fifth place for car number 25. That's somewhat disappointing, as we were good in terms of speed, even though the Porsches were stronger in the end. Now, we need to make the car even faster in the race. It's a bit of a shame because we all had higher hopes after qualifying and thought we might make it to the podium. So the conclusion is that we drivers remained error-free and ended up in fifth place.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 12th place): “Our weekend started perfectly. Our car had a very good balance from the beginning, and Dries' qualifying was again great. We were also doing well in the race after a yellow phase that came at the right time. Then, unfortunately, a competitor took us out in the pit lane. That's extremely disappointing. We had a bad day today, but we also showed with both cars that we are fast and reliable. I am sure that better days will come soon.“\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 2nd place GTD PRO): “P2 for us and P3 for our sister car here in Sebring – a great result for the team. We can be delighted with the results as we also scored important points at the four and eight-hour marks for the Endurance Cup. After our bad luck in Daytona we were all a bit disappointed an knew that we need to get ourselves back up and running here. We achieved that. In the end, the winning Porsche was just a little bit too quick. Although we didn’t have a perfect race, we can be happy to spray some champagne.”\n\nNeil Verhagen (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 3rd place GTD PRO): “It's a great way to end the Sebring 12 Hours. We feel like it’s a little bit of redemption to be on the podium here now as we think we should also have been up there in Daytona. Big thanks to all the guys at Paul Miller Racing for all the hard work that gave us the opportunity to make it onto the podium. We gave it our all und just fell a little bit short. We’ll try even harder next time.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The anniversary weekend in Sebring (USA), celebrating the 50th birthday of BMW of North America, brought both highlights and setbacks for BMW M Motorsport.

Navarran artist Amaya Suberviola has won the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura for her work \"ST25061 (Coger una pestaña con los dedos)\" (Catching an eyelash with your fingers). In the Digital Art category, the award went to Madrid-based Chino Moya for his audiovisual piece \"Metapope\".\n\nWith this edition, the Premio BMW de Pintura celebrates four decades of uninterrupted commitment to culture and artistic talent, consolidating its position as one of the most prestigious competitions in Europe. Since its creation in 1986, the award has advanced the careers of more than 29,000 artists, helping to strengthen the ties between business, art and society.\n\n\"Art is a driver of transformation in thinking, and culture is an essential tool for the development of societies,\" said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, during his speech. \"Our support for art is not an isolated gesture, but a global commitment that seeks to build bridges between creativity, innovation and corporate citizenship.\"\n\nFor his part, Manuel Terroba, Executive President of the BMW Group for Spain and Portugal, emphasised that \"having reached forty editions is living proof that art and innovation, tradition and modernity, can go hand in hand.\" He added that \"the BMW Painting Prize has evolved with the times, opening up to new forms of expression such as digital art and becoming a showcase for diversity, innovation and excellence.\"\n\nA gala celebrating art The Teatro Real in Madrid was the venue for a gala presided over by Her Majesty Queen Sofía, at which more than 1,300 guests from the cultural, artistic and social spheres celebrated the 40th anniversary of this award. The BMW Group paid an emotional tribute to Her Majesty for her constant support of culture and the arts, as well as her commitment to social and humanitarian causes.\n\nThe BMW Group also paid tribute to Her Royal Highness Princess Irene of Greece, whose work at the helm of the Mundo en Armonía Foundation began at the same time as the Premio BMW de Pintura was created, in a clear commitment to bringing together art, culture and solidarity with the most disadvantaged.\n\nIn the same vein, and following the cessation of the Mundo en Armonía Foundation's activities last year, the BMW Group will donate the proceeds from the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura Gala to the Food Bank, with the aim of alleviating the vulnerability experienced by children.\n\nForty years of culture: a journey through Spanish creativityActor and BMW ambassador Álex González hosted the gala and, from the stage, highlighted the cultural significance of this anniversary:\"Forty years of Spanish history, of the evolution of our habits, our customs and our ways of seeing, living and creating. Because culture is not a luxury: it is a necessity. It is the soul of a people. It is what unites us when everything seems to divide us,\" he said.\n\nUnder this premise, the gala featured a musical show with the participation of the RTVE Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Salvador Vázquez, together with the Dúo del Valle, Antonio Najarro and José Mercé, who took an emotional journey through Spanish creation over the last four decades, from Falla to Manuel Alejandro, culminating in a performance of \"Se nos rompió el amor\" in tribute to Rocío Jurado.\n\nThe artist Alaska, responsible for one of the most acclaimed performances of the night, recalled her experiences and the cultural effervescence of 1980s Spain, the era in which the award was born, and defended the value of creativity as a hallmark of identity: \"La Movida did not end in the 1980s. It is revived every time an artist dares to challenge the status quo, and every time Spain reinvents itself.

BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing will compete on 21st/22nd June 2025 in the Green Hell to continue their joint success story at the 24 Hours of #Nürburgring (GER). After the team secured BMW's 20th and most recent overall victory in the Eifel region in 2020, the 21st triumph is now the major goal. The new #BMW M4 GT3 EVO and a strong quartet of BMW M works drivers are taking on this mission.\n\nROWE Racing has been competing in #BMW M Motorsport race cars at the 24h Nürburgring since 2016 and boasts an impressive record. Besides the overall victory in 2020, the team, led by Team Principal Hans-Peter Naundorf, has finished second on the podium three times (2017, 2021, 2023). Last year, the BMW M Team RMG BMW M4 GT3 finished in third place.\n\nThis year, ROWE Racing aims for its second victory and BMW's 21st win at the endurance classic. Taking the wheel of the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO will be Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). Farfus (2010) and van der Linde (2017 and 2022) are already on the winners' list of the 24h Nürburgring, while it would be a first for Krohn and Marciello. To prepare for the highlight, ROWE Racing will compete in the first two season races of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on 22nd March and 26th April.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 EVO will also make its debut on the Nordschleife in the hands of BMW M Motorsport customer teams during the 2025 season. The BMW M2 Racing, which BMW M Motorsport will offer as a new entry-level car starting in 2026, will undergo test runs at the Nürburgring, including the 24-hour race. Additionally, many privately entered BMW race cars of various generations will excite the fans.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are highly motivated to clinch the 21st overall victory for BMW at this year's 24-hour race. Last year, we were very close, and this time we are doing everything we can to stand at the top of the podium for the first time since 2020. With a top team like ROWE Racing and four high-class works drivers, we have created the best possible conditions. The fact that the three most important 24-hour races of the year take place on three consecutive weekends is a massive logistical challenge and anything but ideal. Nevertheless, our goal is to make the most of the situation and provide a great show for our many fans at the Nordschleife. The many private BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers will also contribute to this, giving the event its unique character.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am very much looking forward to seeing the EVO versions of our BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 in action for the first time at the world's toughest endurance race. The 24 Hours of Nürburgring is an absolute highlight for customer racing at BMW M Motorsport every year. The 20 overall and countless class victories over the past 55 years speak for themselves: BMW and the Nordschleife are inseparably linked. Seeing our BMW M2 Racing, which is still in development, in race action is another highlight of what will surely be another great weekend.”\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): “Fundamentally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, our experienced team, and our strong driver line-up, we have all the prerequisites to win at the Nürburgring for the first time since 2020. That is our goal. ROWE Racing is competing for the 14th time, and our drivers, including former Nürburgring winners Augusto Farfus and Kelvin van der Linde, as well as Raffaele Marciello and Jesse Krohn, need not shy away from any other crew. At the same time, the race calendar gives us the unique opportunity to stand at the top of the podium at two 24-hour races within seven days. These are the positives, but it must also be said openly that the very unfortunate scheduling of the 24h Nürburgring presents us with unprecedented organisational challenges. It hurts us that we can only present ourselves with one car to the great fans at the Nürburgring, but given the double burden with the 24h Spa-Francorchamps, it was not possible otherwise.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing will compete on 21st/22nd June 2025 in the Green Hell to continue their joint success story at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER).

After the team secured BMW's 20th and most recent overall victory in the Eifel region in 2020, the 21st triumph is now the major goal.Munich. BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing will compete on 21st/22nd June 2025 in the Green Hell to continue their joint success story at the 24 Hours of #Nürburgring (GER). After the team secured BMW's 20th and most recent overall victory in the Eifel region in 2020, the 21st triumph is now the major goal. The new #BMW M4 GT3 EVO and a strong quartet of BMW M works drivers are taking on this mission.\n\nROWE Racing has been competing in #BMW M Motorsport race cars at the 24h Nürburgring since 2016 and boasts an impressive record. Besides the overall victory in 2020, the team, led by Team Principal Hans-Peter Naundorf, has finished second on the podium three times (2017, 2021, 2023). Last year, the BMW M Team RMG BMW M4 GT3 finished in third place.\n\nThis year, ROWE Racing aims for its second victory and BMW's 21st win at the endurance classic. Taking the wheel of the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO will be Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). Farfus (2010) and van der Linde (2017 and 2022) are already on the winners' list of the 24h Nürburgring, while it would be a first for Krohn and Marciello. To prepare for the highlight, ROWE Racing will compete in the first two season races of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on 22nd March and 26th April.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 EVO will also make its debut on the Nordschleife in the hands of BMW M Motorsport customer teams during the 2025 season. The BMW M2 Racing, which BMW M Motorsport will offer as a new entry-level car starting in 2026, will undergo test runs at the Nürburgring, including the 24-hour race. Additionally, many privately entered BMW race cars of various generations will excite the fans.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are highly motivated to clinch the 21st overall victory for BMW at this year's 24-hour race. Last year, we were very close, and this time we are doing everything we can to stand at the top of the podium for the first time since 2020. With a top team like ROWE Racing and four high-class works drivers, we have created the best possible conditions. The fact that the three most important 24-hour races of the year take place on three consecutive weekends is a massive logistical challenge and anything but ideal. Nevertheless, our goal is to make the most of the situation and provide a great show for our many fans at the Nordschleife. The many private BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers will also contribute to this, giving the event its unique character.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am very much looking forward to seeing the EVO versions of our BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 in action for the first time at the world's toughest endurance race. The 24 Hours of Nürburgring is an absolute highlight for customer racing at BMW M Motorsport every year. The 20 overall and countless class victories over the past 55 years speak for themselves: BMW and the Nordschleife are inseparably linked. Seeing our BMW M2 Racing, which is still in development, in race action is another highlight of what will surely be another great weekend.”\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): “Fundamentally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, our experienced team, and our strong driver line-up, we have all the prerequisites to win at the Nürburgring for the first time since 2020. That is our goal. ROWE Racing is competing for the 14th time, and our drivers, including former Nürburgring winners Augusto Farfus and Kelvin van der Linde, as well as Raffaele Marciello and Jesse Krohn, need not shy away from any other crew.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group has a strong global footprint. It serves as a local partner in individual regions of the world, contributing positively to industrial economic value in all. We currently have production sites at 31 locations on five continents. We also have research and development centres in 17 countries – not to mention 41 sales and marketing and financial services locations across the globe. This is how we make sure specific trends, technological innovations and the different needs of customers in the regions are incorporated in our products and their development. To achieve this, we enter into targeted strategic collaborations with strong and innovative local tech players.\n\nOur environment remains highly volatile and will likely continue to be shaped by unforeseeable circumstances. Many experts assume that the major economic areas are likely to drift further apart – both from a political and technological perspective, and also with regard to regulations. That is why it is so important for us to seize opportunities that will always present themselves at short notice in markets around the world. At the same time, our strategic thinking, our actions and our decision-making are always forward-looking, with a clear long-term focus.\n\nOur goal is for the BMW Group to maintain its profitable growth and always be in a position to make appropriate investments in our own future. In keeping with this logic, we are charting our own course for the future, step by step, with our rolling strategic approach and long-range corporate planning. On the one hand, our strength lies in the consistency with which we pursue our strategy. On the other, it comes from the flexibility and speed with which we tackle sudden changes.\n\nOnce again, we have ambitious plans for the current financial year. After the first three months, we are on track to meet our goals for the full year. As Nicolas Peter explained:\n\nThe financial results for the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 are not directly comparable – due to the one-time effect from the full consolidation of our BBA joint venture.\n\nAt the same time, our product line-up is younger, broader and more attractive than ever. Across all brands, all segments and all drive technologies, we have outstanding vehicles that were recently launched or will be released onto the market in the near future. We are exploiting potential everywhere – and experiencing a noticeable tailwind.\n\nAs you know: We expect Group deliveries to be slightly higher this year, compared to 2022, as we continue to build on our solid incoming orders. This applies equally – and that is a particular quality – to our all-electric models and to our conventionally-powered vehicles.\n\nThis proves once again that: Our long-term product strategy, including ramping up BEVs in line with demand, is delivering results. Through our balanced positioning in the world regions, we can compensate for regional market fluctuations, just as, for example, a certain market weakness in China can currently be offset by a stronger performance in the USA.\n\nOur BEV deliveries grew strongly in Q1 across all four major regions – Europe, Asia, the Americas and the rest of the world. BEV sales for the BMW brand alone grew by 112 percent on average. All regions contributed to this. In April, the BMW brand continued this trend by doubling BEV sales yet again.\n\nOur global balance in BEV growth fits perfectly with our local for local approach to our worldwide manufacturing activities, R&D and our BEV production. Together, all of these factors increase our resilience as a global company.\n\nNow, we are expanding this even more by adding an additional component: local manufacture of high-voltage batteries. This has already been established for current electric models at our facilities in Germany and China. In a next step, we are adding further capacity for the sixth generation of our battery technology – for example, in Woodruff, for our US plant in Spartanburg and in Debrecen, for our future plant in Hungary, as well as in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.\n\nWhat will be the key success factors for us this year?\n\nOur diverse range of products, with a clear focus on ramping up e-mobility.\n\nDigitalisation of our products and of the company.\n\nOn point preparations for the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nLet's take the first point:\n\nRegional differences in demand for alternative drive technologies are becoming increasingly evident. I experienced this for myself just recently. In April, I visited the Japanese market and the Shanghai Auto Show. In Japan, hybrids and efficient combustion-engine vehicles are especially popular with customers. There is also a lot of interest in hydrogen as an alternative method of propulsion. It was therefore not surprising that the BMW iX5 Hydrogen* from our global pilot fleet was welcomed with open arms. Demand for pure battery-electric vehicles, on the other hand, is developing steadily, but slowly, in Japan and remains at a low level.\n\nOn the other hand, you have China, where BEV demand is growing rapidly.\n\nToday, China is already the biggest growth driver for e-mobility. For the first time, BMW presented only electrified models at Auto Shanghai. These included the i7 M70xDrive*, the XM Label Red* and the iX1* long-wheelbase version which we build “in China for China”. It is no secret that China’s BEV market is highly competitive – and equally among both established and new players. Several manufacturers are currently lowering prices – in some cases, substantially – to gain market share. At the BMW Group, we have a strong position in China. In the first quarter of 2023, we sold significantly more BEVs there than our established competitors and also more than many new manufacturers. By the end of this year, the BMW Group will already offer 11 BEV vehicles in China across all our brands. And with our BEVs we are exclusively targeting the upper premium and luxury segments.\n\nAlso, in China and in the current context, we benefit from our broad technological approach. The comparison of the car markets in Japan and China illustrates clearly the extent to which automotive manufacturers face varied market requirements during their transformation. We are targeting profitable growth with all drive technologies and in all segments and therefore leveraging earnings potential.\n\nThe upper premium and luxury segments are a good example of this. Growth in this segment will get a major boost this year from new BMW models: the 7 Series and the XM*, as well as the X7 model update – not to mention the Rolls-Royce model family. We are currently releasing X5 and X6 updates onto the markets, including the particularly successful long wheelbase version of the X5 in China.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the popular and in-demand models from BMW M. Over the coming months we will release the model updates for the X5 M* and X6 M*. Many fans are also looking forward to the BMW M3 Touring* that was just released onto the market. It was recently named “Dream Car of 2023” by Autocar Awards. And the M2 Coupe* is also ready to hit the road.\n\nWith our strong portfolio, we are targeting growth in the mid-double-digit percentage range in the upper premium and luxury segments this year. We are aiming even higher with our fully-electric vehicles – and planning for high double-digit growth. Over the full year, BEVs are expected to account for 15 percent of our global deliveries. This will be another big leap and the highest absolute increase we have targeted to date. Key models, in particular, will drive our sales, including at BMW, the BMW i4* sport coupé, the iX, the iX3* and the new i7* and new iX1*; and at MINI, the Cooper SE*.\n\nAnd we will keep up the pace with additional new products: The new BMW 5 Series and new BMW X2 will be released onto the markets towards the end of the year, including the i5 and iX2 BEV variants. The BMW Group will then have at least one all-electric model in all its main model ranges on the roads. We recently conducted intensive testing of the BMW i5 under the most difficult conditions, including extremely low temperatures. It also impressed media representatives at our recent pre-launch test drive events, as the very positive coverage demonstrates. Bottom line: The BMW 5 Series is THE top business sedan, with all drivetrains — conventional and fully electric.\n\nOur BEV roadmap is precisely defined: By 2024, at least one in five of the BMW Group’s new vehicles should be a BEV; by 2025, it will be one in four; in 2026 one in three. That is another reason why we are in a better position with our targeted BEV ramp-up than our key competitors.\n\nAs a company, we remain innovative: In the field of battery technology, for example, we are in the top three for patent applications in Germany. There were only two battery specialists from Korea and China ahead of us last year.\n\nLet’s move on to the second topic.\n\nDigitalisation is the most dynamic field in the mobility of tomorrow. That is why we are making BMW digital – because digital products and features can only be created in an organisation that views digitalisation holistically as an opportunity. The know-how we have in our team is crucial in this respect. That is why we have launched the biggest individual training programme in the history of our company for key areas of digitalisation. This digital boost will create the knowledge and tools we need to identify and implement digital potential in every area of responsibility.\n\nLet me give you three examples to show how we are implementing this knowledge to create a seamless digital experience of mobility that benefits our customers:\n\nThis brings me to my third and final point:\n\nAlongside our current product line-up, we are also gearing up for the next big breakthrough in innovation. 2023 and 2024 will be the decisive phase of our preparations for the NEUE KLASSE. It will bring added momentum to our sales of all-electric vehicles from 2025 onwards. We plan to release at least six models of this entirely new BMW model generation onto the market in the first 24 months after the start of production.\n\nWe are deliberately starting out in high-volume segments with a Sports Activity Vehicle and a sedan in the 3 Series segment. The NEUE KLASSE embodies all three pillars of future mobility. It is entirely geared towards digitalisation and sustainability, and also fully-electric. Our BMW i Vision Circular from 2021 and this year's BMW i Vision Dee show the direction of our thinking. In just a few months, at the IAA MOBILITY, we will be sharing how the topics of digital, circular and electric complement each other to form a totally new and coherent overall concept.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs you can see, during the current financial year, we are once again taking a two-pronged approach: Internally, we are focusing on our operational excellence. Across all brands and all segments, we are offering our customers a new, modern, technologically diverse and innovative range of products. At the same time, we are systematically investing in our future and aligning the entire company for the launch of the NEUE KLASSE. The BMW Group remains focused on delivering its profitable growth and holding its successful course. For us, that means an EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment within our target range of eight to ten percent – even during the transformation towards e-mobility.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption/emissions data: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: consumption weighted (WLTP): 1,19 kg H2/100 km, combined NEFZ: – , CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - 0 g/km; electric range (WLTP) in km: 504 km (313 miles) BMW XM: Fuel consumption weighted, combined in l/100 km: - (NEDC)/1.6-1.4 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - (NEDC)/36-32 (WLTP); power consumption weighted, combined in kWh/100 km: - (NEDC)/301-28.6 (WLTP); electric range (WLTP) in km: 82-90 BMW XM Label Red: Fuel consumption weighted, combined in l/100 km: - (NEFZ) / 2,0–1,5 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - (NEFZ) / 45–35 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: (NEFZ) / 33,6–32,5 (WLTP); power consumption (WLTP) in km: 76–82.

Through our balanced positioning in the world regions, we can compensate for regional market fluctuations, just as, for example, a certain market weakness in China can currently be offset by a stronger performance in the USA.\n\nOur BEV deliveries grew strongly in Q1 across all four major regions – Europe, Asia, the Americas and the rest of the world. BEV sales for the BMW brand alone grew by 112 percent on average. All regions contributed to this. In April, the BMW brand continued this trend by doubling BEV sales yet again.\n\nOur global balance in BEV growth fits perfectly with our local for local approach to our worldwide manufacturing activities, R&D and our BEV production. Together, all of these factors increase our resilience as a global company.\n\nNow, we are expanding this even more by adding an additional component: local manufacture of high-voltage batteries. This has already been established for current electric models at our facilities in Germany and China. In a next step, we are adding further capacity for the sixth generation of our battery technology – for example, in Woodruff, for our US plant in Spartanburg and in Debrecen, for our future plant in Hungary, as well as in San Luis Potosí, Mexico.\n\nWhat will be the key success factors for us this year?\n\nOur diverse range of products, with a clear focus on ramping up e-mobility.\n\nDigitalisation of our products and of the company.\n\nOn point preparations for the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nLet's take the first point:\n\nRegional differences in demand for alternative drive technologies are becoming increasingly evident. I experienced this for myself just recently. In April, I visited the Japanese market and the Shanghai Auto Show. In Japan, hybrids and efficient combustion-engine vehicles are especially popular with customers. There is also a lot of interest in hydrogen as an alternative method of propulsion. It was therefore not surprising that the BMW iX5 Hydrogen* from our global pilot fleet was welcomed with open arms. Demand for pure battery-electric vehicles, on the other hand, is developing steadily, but slowly, in Japan and remains at a low level.\n\nOn the other hand, you have China, where BEV demand is growing rapidly.\n\nToday, China is already the biggest growth driver for e-mobility. For the first time, BMW presented only electrified models at Auto Shanghai. These included the i7 M70xDrive*, the XM Label Red* and the iX1* long-wheelbase version which we build “in China for China”. It is no secret that China’s BEV market is highly competitive – and equally among both established and new players. Several manufacturers are currently lowering prices – in some cases, substantially – to gain market share. At the BMW Group, we have a strong position in China. In the first quarter of 2023, we sold significantly more BEVs there than our established competitors and also more than many new manufacturers. By the end of this year, the BMW Group will already offer 11 BEV vehicles in China across all our brands. And with our BEVs we are exclusively targeting the upper premium and luxury segments.\n\nAlso, in China and in the current context, we benefit from our broad technological approach. The comparison of the car markets in Japan and China illustrates clearly the extent to which automotive manufacturers face varied market requirements during their transformation. We are targeting profitable growth with all drive technologies and in all segments and therefore leveraging earnings potential.\n\nThe upper premium and luxury segments are a good example of this. Growth in this segment will get a major boost this year from new BMW models: the 7 Series and the XM*, as well as the X7 model update – not to mention the Rolls-Royce model family. We are currently releasing X5 and X6 updates onto the markets, including the particularly successful long wheelbase version of the X5 in China.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the popular and in-demand models from BMW M. Over the coming months we will release the model updates for the X5 M* and X6 M*. Many fans are also looking forward to the BMW M3 Touring* that was just released onto the market. It was recently named “Dream Car of 2023” by Autocar Awards. And the M2 Coupe* is also ready to hit the road.\n\nWith our strong portfolio, we are targeting growth in the mid-double-digit percentage range in the upper premium and luxury segments this year. We are aiming even higher with our fully-electric vehicles – and planning for high double-digit growth. Over the full year, BEVs are expected to account for 15 percent of our global deliveries. This will be another big leap and the highest absolute increase we have targeted to date. Key models, in particular, will drive our sales, including at BMW, the BMW i4* sport coupé, the iX, the iX3* and the new i7* and new iX1*; and at MINI, the Cooper SE*.\n\nAnd we will keep up the pace with additional new products: The new BMW 5 Series and new BMW X2 will be released onto the markets towards the end of the year, including the i5 and iX2 BEV variants. The BMW Group will then have at least one all-electric model in all its main model ranges on the roads. We recently conducted intensive testing of the BMW i5 under the most difficult conditions, including extremely low temperatures. It also impressed media representatives at our recent pre-launch test drive events, as the very positive coverage demonstrates. Bottom line: The BMW 5 Series is THE top business sedan, with all drivetrains — conventional and fully electric.\n\nOur BEV roadmap is precisely defined: By 2024, at least one in five of the BMW Group’s new vehicles should be a BEV; by 2025, it will be one in four; in 2026 one in three. That is another reason why we are in a better position with our targeted BEV ramp-up than our key competitors.\n\nAs a company, we remain innovative: In the field of battery technology, for example, we are in the top three for patent applications in Germany. There were only two battery specialists from Korea and China ahead of us last year.\n\nLet’s move on to the second topic.\n\nDigitalisation is the most dynamic field in the mobility of tomorrow. That is why we are making BMW digital – because digital products and features can only be created in an organisation that views digitalisation holistically as an opportunity. The know-how we have in our team is crucial in this respect. That is why we have launched the biggest individual training programme in the history of our company for key areas of digitalisation. This digital boost will create the knowledge and tools we need to identify and implement digital potential in every area of responsibility.\n\nLet me give you three examples to show how we are implementing this knowledge to create a seamless digital experience of mobility that benefits our customers:\n\nThis brings me to my third and final point:\n\nAlongside our current product line-up, we are also gearing up for the next big breakthrough in innovation. 2023 and 2024 will be the decisive phase of our preparations for the NEUE KLASSE. It will bring added momentum to our sales of all-electric vehicles from 2025 onwards. We plan to release at least six models of this entirely new BMW model generation onto the market in the first 24 months after the start of production.\n\nWe are deliberately starting out in high-volume segments with a Sports Activity Vehicle and a sedan in the 3 Series segment. The NEUE KLASSE embodies all three pillars of future mobility. It is entirely geared towards digitalisation and sustainability, and also fully-electric. Our BMW i Vision Circular from 2021 and this year's BMW i Vision Dee show the direction of our thinking. In just a few months, at the IAA MOBILITY, we will be sharing how the topics of digital, circular and electric complement each other to form a totally new and coherent overall concept.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs you can see, during the current financial year, we are once again taking a two-pronged approach: Internally, we are focusing on our operational excellence. Across all brands and all segments, we are offering our customers a new, modern, technologically diverse and innovative range of products. At the same time, we are systematically investing in our future and aligning the entire company for the launch of the NEUE KLASSE. The BMW Group remains focused on delivering its profitable growth and holding its successful course. For us, that means an EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment within our target range of eight to ten percent – even during the transformation towards e-mobility.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption/emissions data: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: consumption weighted (WLTP): 1,19 kg H2/100 km, combined NEFZ: – , CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - 0 g/km; electric range (WLTP) in km: 504 km (313 miles) BMW XM: Fuel consumption weighted, combined in l/100 km: - (NEDC)/1.6-1.4 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - (NEDC)/36-32 (WLTP); power consumption weighted, combined in kWh/100 km: - (NEDC)/301-28.6 (WLTP); electric range (WLTP) in km: 82-90 BMW XM Label Red: Fuel consumption weighted, combined in l/100 km: - (NEFZ) / 2,0–1,5 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - (NEFZ) / 45–35 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: (NEFZ) / 33,6–32,5 (WLTP); power consumption (WLTP) in km: 76–82.

It serves as a local partner in individual regions of the world, contributing positively to industrial economic value in all. We currently have production sites at 31 locations on five continents. We also have research and development centres in 17 countries – not to mention 41 sales and marketing and financial services locations across the globe. This is how we make sure specific trends, technological innovations and the different needs of customers in the regions are incorporated in our products and their development. To achieve this, we enter into targeted strategic collaborations with strong and innovative local tech players.\n\nOur environment remains highly volatile and will likely continue to be shaped by unforeseeable circumstances. Many experts assume that the major economic areas are likely to drift further apart – both from a political and technological perspective, and also with regard to regulations. That is why it is so important for us to seize opportunities that will always present themselves at short notice in markets around the world. At the same time, our strategic thinking, our actions and our decision-making are always forward-looking, with a clear long-term focus.\n\nOur goal is for the BMW Group to maintain its profitable growth and always be in a position to make appropriate investments in our own future. In keeping with this logic, we are charting our own course for the future, step by step, with our rolling strategic approach and long-range corporate planning. On the one hand, our strength lies in the consistency with which we pursue our strategy. On the other, it comes from the flexibility and speed with which we tackle sudden changes.\n\nOnce again, we have ambitious plans for the current financial year. After the first three months, we are on track to meet our goals for the full year. As Nicolas Peter explained:\n\nThe financial results for the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 are not directly comparable – due to the one-time effect from the full consolidation of our BBA joint venture.\n\nAt the same time, our product line-up is younger, broader and more attractive than ever. Across all brands, all segments and all drive technologies, we have outstanding vehicles that were recently launched or will be released onto the market in the near future. We are exploiting potential everywhere – and experiencing a noticeable tailwind.\n\nAs you know: We expect Group deliveries to be slightly higher this year, compared to 2022, as we continue to build on our solid incoming orders.

We are currently releasing X5 and X6 updates onto the markets, including the particularly successful long wheelbase version of the X5 in China.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the popular and in-demand models from BMW M. Over the coming months we will release the model updates for the X5 M* and X6 M*. Many fans are also looking forward to the BMW M3 Touring* that was just released onto the market. It was recently named “Dream Car of 2023” by Autocar Awards. And the M2 Coupe* is also ready to hit the road.\n\nWith our strong portfolio, we are targeting growth in the mid-double-digit percentage range in the upper premium and luxury segments this year. We are aiming even higher with our fully-electric vehicles – and planning for high double-digit growth. Over the full year, BEVs are expected to account for 15 percent of our global deliveries. This will be another big leap and the highest absolute increase we have targeted to date. Key models, in particular, will drive our sales, including at BMW, the BMW i4* sport coupé, the iX, the iX3* and the new i7* and new iX1*; and at MINI, the Cooper SE*.\n\nAnd we will keep up the pace with additional new products: The new BMW 5 Series and new BMW X2 will be released onto the markets towards the end of the year, including the i5 and iX2 BEV variants. The BMW Group will then have at least one all-electric model in all its main model ranges on the roads. We recently conducted intensive testing of the BMW i5 under the most difficult conditions, including extremely low temperatures. It also impressed media representatives at our recent pre-launch test drive events, as the very positive coverage demonstrates. Bottom line: The BMW 5 Series is THE top business sedan, with all drivetrains — conventional and fully electric.\n\nOur BEV roadmap is precisely defined: By 2024, at least one in five of the BMW Group’s new vehicles should be a BEV; by 2025, it will be one in four; in 2026 one in three. That is another reason why we are in a better position with our targeted BEV ramp-up than our key competitors.\n\nAs a company, we remain innovative: In the field of battery technology, for example, we are in the top three for patent applications in Germany. There were only two battery specialists from Korea and China ahead of us last year.\n\nLet’s move on to the second topic.\n\nDigitalisation is the most dynamic field in the mobility of tomorrow. That is why we are making BMW digital – because digital products and features can only be created in an organisation that views digitalisation holistically as an opportunity. The know-how we have in our team is crucial in this respect. That is why we have launched the biggest individual training programme in the history of our company for key areas of digitalisation. This digital boost will create the knowledge and tools we need to identify and implement digital potential in every area of responsibility.\n\nLet me give you three examples to show how we are implementing this knowledge to create a seamless digital experience of mobility that benefits our customers:\n\nThis brings me to my third and final point:\n\nAlongside our current product line-up, we are also gearing up for the next big breakthrough in innovation. 2023 and 2024 will be the decisive phase of our preparations for the NEUE KLASSE. It will bring added momentum to our sales of all-electric vehicles from 2025 onwards. We plan to release at least six models of this entirely new BMW model generation onto the market in the first 24 months after the start of production.\n\nWe are deliberately starting out in high-volume segments with a Sports Activity Vehicle and a sedan in the 3 Series segment. The NEUE KLASSE embodies all three pillars of future mobility. It is entirely geared towards digitalisation and sustainability, and also fully-electric. Our BMW i Vision Circular from 2021 and this year's BMW i Vision Dee show the direction of our thinking. In just a few months, at the IAA MOBILITY, we will be sharing how the topics of digital, circular and electric complement each other to form a totally new and coherent overall concept.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs you can see, during the current financial year, we are once again taking a two-pronged approach: Internally, we are focusing on our operational excellence. Across all brands and all segments, we are offering our customers a new, modern, technologically diverse and innovative range of products. At the same time, we are systematically investing in our future and aligning the entire company for the launch of the NEUE KLASSE. The BMW Group remains focused on delivering its profitable growth and holding its successful course. For us, that means an EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment within our target range of eight to ten percent – even during the transformation towards e-mobility.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption/emissions data: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: consumption weighted (WLTP): 1,19 kg H2/100 km, combined NEFZ: – , CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - 0 g/km; electric range (WLTP) in km: 504 km (313 miles) BMW XM: Fuel consumption weighted, combined in l/100 km: - (NEDC)/1.6-1.4 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - (NEDC)/36-32 (WLTP); power consumption weighted, combined in kWh/100 km: - (NEDC)/301-28.6 (WLTP); electric range (WLTP) in km: 82-90 BMW XM Label Red: Fuel consumption weighted, combined in l/100 km: - (NEFZ) / 2,0–1,5 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: - (NEFZ) / 45–35 (WLTP); CO2 emissions weighted, combined in g/km: (NEFZ) / 33,6–32,5 (WLTP); power consumption (WLTP) in km: 76–82.

BMW M Motorsport embarks on the most spectacular racing week of the year with the slogan “BMW M is back at Le Mans”. Exactly 25 years after the victory of the BMW V12 LMR, the start of the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the Hypercar class marks the return of the BMW brand to the top category at the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 will play a very special role as it competes as the 20th BMW Art Car. Designed by the internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu, the car will be a highlight in the paddock. In the LMGT3 class of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC), two BMW M4 GT3s will compete for victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe.\n\nIn the Hypercar class, BMW M Team WRT and six BMW M works drivers face what is probably the toughest competition in current motorsport. 23 Hypercars from nine manufacturers are registered for the endurance highlight of the year. In the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) will take turns driving. The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car will be raced by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). The design of the 20th BMW Art Car by Julie Mehretu was unveiled on May 21 at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (FRA). It was created based on one of the artist’s works as a “performative painting.” More details can be found in the BMW M Motorsport Media Guide: \n\nIn the LMGT3 category, Team WRT fields two BMW M4 GT3s in new liveries. The #31 BMW M4 GT3 will be driven by the winners of the 6 Hours of Imola (ITA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR). The #46 car will be shared by Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA).\n\nHistory of BMW at Le Mans.\n\nOn the occasion of the comeback in the top class after 25 years, BMW is also celebrating its history at Le Mans. Legendary vehicles such as the BMW V12 LMR winning car from 1999 and the BMW 3.0 CSL Art Car by Alexander Calder from 1975 can be admired by the more than 300,000 expected fans.\n\nBMW’s first successful start at Le Mans took place back in 1939 with a BMW 328 Touring Coupé. It won its class and finished fifth overall. It wasn’t until the 1970s that BMW once again made waves at Le Mans, especially with the invention of the BMW Art Cars by Jochen Neerpasch and Hervé Poulain. The Calder Art Car debuted in 1975. That was followed by the BMW 3.0 CSL by Frank Stella in 1976, the BMW 320i Turbo by Roy Lichtenstein in 1977, and the BMW M1 by Andy Warhol in 1979. Other BMW Art Cars at Le Mans included the BMW V12 LMR by Jenny Holzer in 1999 and the BMW M3 GT2 by Jeff Koons in 2010.\n\nBMW M Motorsport achieved its greatest sporting successes in the 1990s. Above all stands the overall victory for Yannick Dalmas (FRA), Pierluigi Martini (ITA), and Joachim Winkelhock (GER) in the #15 BMW V12 LMR in 1999. By 1995, a car powered by a BMW engine had already won, namely the BMW McLaren F1 GTR. Most recently, BMW M Motorsport competed in 2018 and 2019 with the BMW M8 GTE.\n\nThe following link contains video interviews with preview statements from all Hypercar drivers, as well as from Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, and Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \n\nFurther quotes before the 24 Hours of Le Mans:\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “It is the fourth time that we go to Le Mans, but it will be our debut in the top class. Just to be there, defending the colours of a top manufacturer such as BMW, and bringing the largest entry we have ever brought to Le Mans, makes us proud of what we have achieved as a team. Still, this is a reflection that keeps our minds busy for no more than a couple of minutes. The really important thing is the competition ahead of us. In Hypercar, it is difficult to tell what our ambitions can be. We have had a start of the season that was eventful and promising at the same time. It’s difficult to make predictions until we’re on track at Le Mans. That’s when we’ll know where we stand. Concerning the LMGT3 the objective is to make up the points lost at Spa. We won on strategy at Imola but were very unlucky at Spa. We had an ideal plan to arrive at Le Mans leading the standings, and this is not the case, so the objective is to close the gap here. We have a competitive car and great drivers, so we’ll aim at making a perfect and faultless race. We all know that in 24-hour races that generally pays off.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3): “I have unfinished business with Le Mans, as I always had bad luck there during my time with BMW M Motorsport and could never finish the race. I want to change that this time, of course. Our BMW M4 GT3 has shown very strong pace in the first FIA WEC races of the season, even though we unfortunately couldn’t convert that into points recently at Spa-Francorchamps. I think, with an experienced team like WRT, we can go into the 24 Hours of Le Mans with high expectations.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3): “The big moment has arrived, and it will be my first time at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the most famous race in the world. I am very happy and proud to be associated with BMW and Team WRT for this big race. I have known the track since last year, having participated in the Road to Le Mans race, and I like the Circuit de La Sarthe a lot. We’ll be there for a long week and we are ready. We had some good performances in the first races of the season, but now we need to understand our level, speed, and competitiveness at Le Mans. We hope to be strong and I cannot wait to live this experience!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport embarks on the most spectacular racing week of the year with the slogan “BMW M is back at Le Mans”.

That was followed by the BMW 3.0 CSL by Frank Stella in 1976, the BMW 320i Turbo by Roy Lichtenstein in 1977, and the BMW M1 by Andy Warhol in 1979. Other BMW Art Cars at Le Mans included the BMW V12 LMR by Jenny Holzer in 1999 and the BMW M3 GT2 by Jeff Koons in 2010.\n\nBMW M Motorsport achieved its greatest sporting successes in the 1990s. Above all stands the overall victory for Yannick Dalmas (FRA), Pierluigi Martini (ITA), and Joachim Winkelhock (GER) in the #15 BMW V12 LMR in 1999. By 1995, a car powered by a BMW engine had already won, namely the BMW McLaren F1 GTR. Most recently, BMW M Motorsport competed in 2018 and 2019 with the BMW M8 GTE.\n\nThe following link contains video interviews with preview statements from all Hypercar drivers, as well as from Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, and Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \n\nFurther quotes before the 24 Hours of Le Mans:\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “It is the fourth time that we go to Le Mans, but it will be our debut in the top class. Just to be there, defending the colours of a top manufacturer such as BMW, and bringing the largest entry we have ever brought to Le Mans, makes us proud of what we have achieved as a team. Still, this is a reflection that keeps our minds busy for no more than a couple of minutes. The really important thing is the competition ahead of us. In Hypercar, it is difficult to tell what our ambitions can be. We have had a start of the season that was eventful and promising at the same time. It’s difficult to make predictions until we’re on track at Le Mans. That’s when we’ll know where we stand. Concerning the LMGT3 the objective is to make up the points lost at Spa. We won on strategy at Imola but were very unlucky at Spa. We had an ideal plan to arrive at Le Mans leading the standings, and this is not the case, so the objective is to close the gap here. We have a competitive car and great drivers, so we’ll aim at making a perfect and faultless race. We all know that in 24-hour races that generally pays off.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3): “I have unfinished business with Le Mans, as I always had bad luck there during my time with BMW M Motorsport and could never finish the race. I want to change that this time, of course. Our BMW M4 GT3 has shown very strong pace in the first FIA WEC races of the season, even though we unfortunately couldn’t convert that into points recently at Spa-Francorchamps. I think, with an experienced team like WRT, we can go into the 24 Hours of Le Mans with high expectations.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3): “The big moment has arrived, and it will be my first time at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the most famous race in the world. I am very happy and proud to be associated with BMW and Team WRT for this big race. I have known the track since last year, having participated in the Road to Le Mans race, and I like the Circuit de La Sarthe a lot. We’ll be there for a long week and we are ready. We had some good performances in the first races of the season, but now we need to understand our level, speed, and competitiveness at Le Mans. We hope to be strong and I cannot wait to live this experience!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Viktor Hovland has won the BMW Championship 2023 with one of the best-ever performances in the final round of a PGA TOUR event. The Norwegian carded seven birdies on the back nine on his way to a course record of 61 strokes (9 under par). It was the lowest score in the history of the Playoffs and good enough to reel in the leaders after three rounds, Scottie Scheffler (USA) and Matt Fitzpatrick (ENG). With his fifth win on the PGA TOUR, the 25-year-old moved up to second place in the FedExCup rankings. It is a second BMW title for Hovland, to add to his win at the BMW International Open 2021 in Munich (GER).\n\n“Congratulations to Viktor Hovland on his incredible performance, especially in the final round, to become the 2023 BMW Champion,” said Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate. “It has been a historic tournament week at a fantastic venue with great fans. Many thanks to the Olympia Fields Country Club, all our partners, volunteers and everyone involved. In addition to hosting a great tournament, the BMW Group is especially proud to know that the BMW Championship makes a difference in the lives of so many young people.”\n\nAll proceeds from the BMW Championship will benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF). Since the tournament’s inception in 2007, the BMW Championship has raised over 45 million US dollars for the ESF and sent 3,300 caddies to college. These totals do not include the BMW Championship 2023. Currently, the ESF is helping a record number of 1,130 caddies to study.\n\nHovland had started the final round three shots behind Scheffler and Fitzpatrick, and it seemed likely to remain a battle between the two Major winners for some time. However, the Norwegian then put on a memorable performance as every shot hit its mark. With the exception of the two par 3 holes, he birdied everything on the difficult back nine of the North Course. Scheffler and Fitzpatrick were unable to counter this brilliant display.\n\n“To win the BMW Championship at a course like Olympia Fields against the world’s best players is a really incredible feeling,” said Hovland. “That has to be the best round I've ever played. Given the circumstances - a playoff event, this golf course - the way I played the last holes was pretty special.\"\n\nFor Scheffler and Fitzpatrick (both -15) shared second place ahead of Rory McIlroy (NIR, -12), with Open champion Brian Harman and Max Homa (both USA, -11) tied for fifth.\n\nSecond place for world no. 1 Scheffler was enough to defend his FedExCup lead and secure a spot at the Playoff final, the TOUR Championship, which will take place next week at the East Lake Golf Club (Atlanta) with the BMW Group as “Official Vehicle Partner”. Hovland climed up to second place, with McIlroy still third. Fitzpatrick leapt up from 40th position to tenth.\n\nThe BMW Championship is the penultimate Playoff tournament at which just 30 of the 50 players who started the event in Chicago qualify for the season final. The last three tickets were secured by Tyrrell Hatton (ENG, +1, T34), Jordan Spieth (USA, +1, T34) and Sepp Straka (AUT, +2, T37). Despite a strong tournament performance, Sahith Theegala (USA, -6, T15) was marooned in 31st place.\n\nThis week also heralded some key decisions for the American Ryder Cup team. The BMW Championship was the final opportunity to score points and qualify for the team led by captain Zach Johnson (USA). Scottie Scheffler, Wyndham Clark, Patrick Cantlay, Brian Harman, Max Homa and Xander Schauffele have all secured their spot in the team. Johnson will use his Captain’s Pick on 29th August to select another six pros and round off the team that will go up against the Europeans from 25th September to 1st October 2023 in Rome (ITA). BMW will support the legendary team competition as Worldwide Partner.\n\nNext year will see the BMW Championship make a first visit to the Castle Pines Golf Club, south of Denver. In 2025, the tournament will repeat its 2021 visit to the Caves Valley Golf Club (Baltimore), while the 2026 schedule features the Bellerive Country Club (St. Louis) as host for the first time since 2008.

However, the Norwegian then put on a memorable performance as every shot hit its mark. With the exception of the two par 3 holes, he birdied everything on the difficult back nine of the North Course. Scheffler and Fitzpatrick were unable to counter this brilliant display.\n\n“To win the BMW Championship at a course like Olympia Fields against the world’s best players is a really incredible feeling,” said Hovland. “That has to be the best round I've ever played.

Hovland climed up to second place, with McIlroy still third. Fitzpatrick leapt up from 40th position to tenth.\n\nThe BMW Championship is the penultimate Playoff tournament at which just 30 of the 50 players who started the event in Chicago qualify for the season final.

The BMW M2 Racing performed excellently under typically chaotic Eifel conditions and proved that it delivers everything we expect from our new entry-level race car. Many thanks to the team at FK Performance Motorsport, the drivers, and the BMW M Motorsport engineers for this strong and professional performance. With a total of 13 class victories, our teams have demonstrated that they are capable of winning with various BMW M Motorsport race cars – and will certainly play a leading role in the 24-hour race. That only increases my anticipation for the season highlight. Congratulations also to BMW Italia Ceccato Racing and Century Motorsport on their successes in the Italian GT and British GT. The ‘Crazy Month of June’ with three major 24-hour races in a row – along with many other customer racing highlights – can come!”\n\n24h Nürburgring Qualifiers: Baptism by rain for the BMW M2 Racing.\n\nThe BMW M2 Racing experienced the full toughness of the “Green Hell” last weekend at the 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers, passing its ultimate test ahead of the endurance classic in June with flying colors. The first of two four-hour races on Saturday evening in particular, held in pouring rain, put the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car, the FK Performance Motorsport team, and the three drivers – BMW M works drivers Ugo de Wilde and Charles Weerts (both BEL), along with motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER) – to the test. The BMW M2 Racing ran flawlessly however, and crossed the finish line second in its SP3T class. In Sunday’s race, the car emerged largely unscathed from an unavoidable collision and secured third place in class.\n\n“The BMW M2 Racing completed both races without any technical problems,” said Weerts. “It’s a lot of fun to drive. It has a lot of mechanical grip, which allows for quite high cornering speeds. Even under Saturday’s extreme conditions with heavy rain, the car gave us a good feeling and performed strongly. On Sunday I was hit pretty hard by another competitor, but there was hardly any damage to the car, and we were able to finish the weekend successfully and gain a lot of insights.” De Wilde added: “It was my first time with the BMW M2 Racing on the Nordschleife – and it was a fantastic experience. I earned my permit with the BMW M240i Racing, and the differences to the new car are enormous. The BMW M2 Racing is easier to drive, the suspension and brakes are significantly improved. I felt very comfortable. For me personally, it was important to get to know the Nordschleife better – especially under crazy conditions. After this weekend, I understand why it’s called the ‘Green Hell’. Still, I’m really looking forward to the 24-hour race.”\n\nThe 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers were generally a great success for the BMW M Motorsport teams. With six class wins on Saturday and seven on Sunday, the teams had an impressive dress rehearsal for June’s season highlight. The new BMW M4 GT4 EVO dominated the SP8T class with quadruple victories on both days. First place on each occasion went to FK Performance Motorsport. A BMW M4 GT4 EVO also competed in the AT3 class, where the Giti Tire Motorsport by WS Racing team won both races. No BMW M4 GT3 EVO participated in the top SP9 class. ROWE Racing will return to action at the 24-hour race.\n\nItalian GT Championship: BMW Italia Ceccato Racing starts the Sprint season with a victory.\n\nBMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN), along with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing, made a strong start to the Sprint season of the Italian GT Championship at Vallelunga (ITA). Klingmann and the team led by Roberto Ravaglia (ITA) are defending champions, and Krohn has now rejoined as a full-time driver for the sprint races. In the first race on Saturday, the duo took victory in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Due to regulations, they had to serve pit stop penalties in Sunday’s race but still managed seventh overall and fifth in the GT3 Pro class.\n\n“Vallelunga was a very strong weekend for us,” said Klingmann. “With Saturday’s win, we’ve started our title defense mission for the third year in a row. That gave us and the team a lot of confidence that we’re competitive and can fight for the title again. On Sunday, we tried to make the most of the pit stop penalties, which are based on Saturday’s results, and to limit the damage. At the next sprint race at Mugello, we’ll be penalty-free again and ready to go all out. Our mission this year is clear: we want to defend the title. I’m very happy to have made a strong statement with Roberto Ravaglia’s team and my teammate Jesse.”\n\n“I’m very happy to be back with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing in the Italian GT Championship, and it was great to start the season with a win,” said Krohn. “I’m here to help the team win a third title, and I’ll do everything I can to make that happen. I’m also thrilled to be racing with Jens again. He was one of my first teammates when I joined BMW M Motorsport eleven years ago.”\n\nTheir teammates William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) also started the Sprint season successfully in the #2 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. On Saturday, they finished third overall and took victory in the GT3 Pro-Am class. On Sunday, however, the duo retired early.\n\nBritish GT Championship: Century Motorsport wins with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO at Oulton Park.\n\nFans witnessed two dramatic races in the British GT Championship on Monday at Oulton Park (GBR). Branden Templeton and Chris Salkeld (both GBR) claimed their first win of the season in the #14 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Century Motorsport after previously scoring two second-place finishes. They won the GT4 Silver class in the first race and took third overall among the GT4 cars. In the second race, which saw some rain-related chaos, they finished second in their class and returned to the podium.\n\nThings took a dramatic turn on Monday for their teammates Ravi Ramyead and Charlie Robertson (both GBR) in the #71 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. After a win and a second-place finish earlier in the season, they arrived at Oulton Park as GT4 class leaders. In the first race, Ramyead built a solid lead in the GT4 field – but then suffered a heavy crash into the barriers. The good news was that Ramyead was uninjured. Unfortunately, the #71 was too badly damaged to compete in the second race of the day.\n\nIn the GT4 drivers’ standings of the British GT Championship, Ramyead and Robertson now sit in second place after four races, directly followed by Templeton/Salkeld in third."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers: Baptism by rain for the BMW M2 Racing +++ BMW Italia Ceccato Racing kicks off the Sprint season in Italy with a victory +++ Century Motorsport wins with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO at Oulton Park +++"}]}

On Sunday I was hit pretty hard by another competitor, but there was hardly any damage to the car, and we were able to finish the weekend successfully and gain a lot of insights.” De Wilde added: “It was my first time with the BMW M2 Racing on the Nordschleife – and it was a fantastic experience. I earned my permit with the BMW M240i Racing, and the differences to the new car are enormous. The BMW M2 Racing is easier to drive, the suspension and brakes are significantly improved. I felt very comfortable. For me personally, it was important to get to know the Nordschleife better – especially under crazy conditions. After this weekend, I understand why it’s called the ‘Green Hell’. Still, I’m really looking forward to the 24-hour race.”\n\nThe 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers were generally a great success for the BMW M Motorsport teams. With six class wins on Saturday and seven on Sunday, the teams had an impressive dress rehearsal for June’s season highlight. The new BMW M4 GT4 EVO dominated the SP8T class with quadruple victories on both days. First place on each occasion went to FK Performance Motorsport. A BMW M4 GT4 EVO also competed in the AT3 class, where the Giti Tire Motorsport by WS Racing team won both races. No BMW M4 GT3 EVO participated in the top SP9 class. ROWE Racing will return to action at the 24-hour race.\n\nItalian GT Championship: BMW Italia Ceccato Racing starts the Sprint season with a victory.\n\nBMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN), along with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing, made a strong start to the Sprint season of the Italian GT Championship at Vallelunga (ITA). Klingmann and the team led by Roberto Ravaglia (ITA) are defending champions, and Krohn has now rejoined as a full-time driver for the sprint races. In the first race on Saturday, the duo took victory in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Due to regulations, they had to serve pit stop penalties in Sunday’s race but still managed seventh overall and fifth in the GT3 Pro class.\n\n“Vallelunga was a very strong weekend for us,” said Klingmann. “With Saturday’s win, we’ve started our title defense mission for the third year in a row. That gave us and the team a lot of confidence that we’re competitive and can fight for the title again. On Sunday, we tried to make the most of the pit stop penalties, which are based on Saturday’s results, and to limit the damage. At the next sprint race at Mugello, we’ll be penalty-free again and ready to go all out. Our mission this year is clear: we want to defend the title. I’m very happy to have made a strong statement with Roberto Ravaglia’s team and my teammate Jesse.”\n\n“I’m very happy to be back with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing in the Italian GT Championship, and it was great to start the season with a win,” said Krohn. “I’m here to help the team win a third title, and I’ll do everything I can to make that happen. I’m also thrilled to be racing with Jens again. He was one of my first teammates when I joined BMW M Motorsport eleven years ago.”\n\nTheir teammates William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) also started the Sprint season successfully in the #2 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. On Saturday, they finished third overall and took victory in the GT3 Pro-Am class. On Sunday, however, the duo retired early.\n\nBritish GT Championship: Century Motorsport wins with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO at Oulton Park.\n\nFans witnessed two dramatic races in the British GT Championship on Monday at Oulton Park (GBR). Branden Templeton and Chris Salkeld (both GBR) claimed their first win of the season in the #14 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Century Motorsport after previously scoring two second-place finishes. They won the GT4 Silver class in the first race and took third overall among the GT4 cars. In the second race, which saw some rain-related chaos, they finished second in their class and returned to the podium.\n\nThings took a dramatic turn on Monday for their teammates Ravi Ramyead and Charlie Robertson (both GBR) in the #71 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. After a win and a second-place finish earlier in the season, they arrived at Oulton Park as GT4 class leaders. In the first race, Ramyead built a solid lead in the GT4 field – but then suffered a heavy crash into the barriers. The good news was that Ramyead was uninjured. Unfortunately, the #71 was too badly damaged to compete in the second race of the day.\n\nIn the GT4 drivers’ standings of the British GT Championship, Ramyead and Robertson now sit in second place after four races, directly followed by Templeton/Salkeld in third."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Today, on World Children’s Day, the BMW Group and UNICEF are announcing their long-term partnership under the slogan “BRIDGE. Educating young people for tomorrow, today.”\n\nThe partnership will contribute to UNICEF’s global aim to reach 10 million children and young people each year through education. The BMW Group’s long-term support, with an initial commitment over seven years, will help provide science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education and skills development to children and young people in Africa, Asia and Central and South America.\n\nSTEM-related jobs are the engine of global economic growth, yet millions of these jobs are projected to go unfilled due to a gap in skills. The problem is more acute in low- and middle-income countries and much more prevalent among girls and women. Today, women constitute a minority in both STEM education and careers, representing only 28 per cent of engineering graduates, 22 per cent of artificial intelligence workers and less than one third of tech sector employees globally.\n\n“Young people around the world have the power and creativity to influence societies for the better,” says Georg Graf Waldersee, Chairman of the Board at UNICEF Germany. “We need to empower and support them so they can become the innovators and change makers of tomorrow. Because sustainable transformation and the path to a fairer, safer world begin where young minds come together and discover their potential – in classrooms or working labs. We are proud and grateful that the BMW Group is accompanying and supporting us on this journey as a strong private sector partner.”\n\n“At the BMW Group, we believe that education is the engine that drives the development of our society,” states Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management at BMW AG, People and Real Estate, Labour Relations Director. “With UNICEF, we have a long-standing partner at our side who shares this opinion. Therefore, I am beyond delighted that we are joining forces with our global collaboration over the long term from now on. Together, we will bridge the gap between schooling and working life as well as enable the transfer of knowledge.”\n\nIlka Horstmeier continues: “With our multinational workforce on five continents, we consider ourselves as a true corporate citizen. It is not only important for us to be engaged on a global level, but also on a local one. That’s why, together with UNICEF, we get involved at the BMW Group sites worldwide. Additionally, it is great that we can give our diverse network of stakeholders the chance to engage and participate in the partnership to ensure basic education for children in crisis situations.”\n\nFollowing the launch of the collaboration between the BMW Group and UNICEF in South Africa in 2023, the partnership will be expanded in 2024 to Brazil, India, Mexico and Thailand – all of which have programme needs and have BMW Group presence. The collaboration will support programmes ranging from providing laboratory equipment to developing a customized teacher training curriculum, and from mentorships to job-shadowing. With this in mind, the BMW Group is not only providing financial support amounting to two million euros each year until 2030, but also contributing its own expertise and network.\n\nIn addition, in 2024, the BMW Group will join forces with its global network of affiliates and with the involvement of stakeholders to raise funds to support the UNICEF’s work in emergencies and protracted crisis thereby ensuring continuity of children’s learning in safe environments.\n\nFor further information, please contact:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, on World Children’s Day, the BMW Group and UNICEF are announcing their long-term partnership under the slogan “BRIDGE.

The 2023 DTM season came to a close at the Hockenheimring (GER), with an impressive crowd of 88,000 spectators. René Rast (GER) treated fans to a remarkable comeback in the Sunday race, climbing from 23rd on the grid to secure a third-place finish. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) wrapped up his last DTM race for now with the number 1 finishing in fourth place. He had already congratulated his successor, Thomas Preining (AUT, Porsche), for his title win after the qualifying session. Marco Wittmann (GER) concluded a disappointing for him season with ninth and 17th-place finishes in the two Hockenheim races.\n\nSchubert Motorsport managed to secure two season wins and a total of eight podium finishes after 16 races. Van der Linde finished the season in fourth place in the driver standings with 151 points, closely followed by Rast in fifth place with 140 points. This was a remarkable performance for Rast in his first season as a BMW M works driver, especially considering he missed the race weekend at Zandvoort (NED) due to a scheduling conflict. Schubert Motorsport finished fourth in the team standings, and Wittmann concluded his eleventh DTM season in 13th place in the overall rankings.\n\nFrom BMW M Motorsport's perspective, the highlights of the year were the race weekends at the Norisring (GER) and the Red Bull Ring (AUT). Van der Linde secured his only season win at the city race in Nürnberg (GER) and finished third in the second race. Rast achieved his first podium finishes as a BMW M works driver by securing second place in both races. He celebrated his first victory in the BMW M4 GT3 at Spielberg (AUT), where van der Linde sealed a one-two victory for Schubert Motorsport on Sunday. Unfortunately, Wittmann missed out on a podium finish in the 2023 season. He finished fourth in the Sunday races at Zandvoort (NED) and Spielberg as part of the new Project 1 team.\n\nReactions on the DTM season finale:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The final race of the DTM season in front of this fantastic crowd at Hockenheim ended on a positive note with third and fourth places for René Rast and Sheldon van der Linde. René’s comeback from 23rd place to third was truly impressive! Overall, we cannot be satisfied with our performance in the DTM this time. When you start the year as the defending champion in the driver and team standings, you naturally want to repeat that success. In the 2023 season, we didn't manage to show consistent performance at all race weekends for various reasons with the BMW M4 GT3. I would like to thank our drivers, teams, and all BMW M Motorsport employees involved in the DTM project. Congratulations to Thomas Preining, Manthey EMA Racing, and Porsche Motorsport on their well-deserved titles!”\n\nRené Rast (#33 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “This podium finish at the end is a huge surprise for me. To climb from 23rd to third in the DTM is usually impossible, but I got lucky, was in the right place at the right time, and managed to gain ten places in the first few laps. After that, my pace was very good, and with the late pit stop, which was absolutely great with a time of 5.9 seconds, I executed the overcut to reach the top. I am very happy with fifth place in the driver standings in my first year with BMW M Motorsport, especially considering I had to skip a weekend. It wasn't easy at the beginning to adjust to a new car and a new team, but overall, it went really well.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “Both the race and the entire season were bittersweet for me. A podium was still within reach at the end, but unfortunately, it didn't quite happen. Overall, this year, we didn't always maximise our potential, even though the team did a great job. Congratulations to Thomas Preining on winning the title! He had a fantastic season.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 BMW M4 GT3, Project 1): “This was my worst DTM season in eleven years, and I'm honestly glad it's over. It's extremely unfortunate that we couldn't show the fans and ourselves what we set out to achieve. We had two reasonably good race weekends at Zandvoort and Spielberg, but otherwise, we have to admit that as a new team in this high-calibre field, we were simply out of contention. Personally, this is very frustrating for me because I have higher expectations. I am now looking forward to the winter break.

Congratulations to Thomas Preining, Manthey EMA Racing, and Porsche Motorsport on their well-deserved titles!”\n\nRené Rast (#33 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “This podium finish at the end is a huge surprise for me. To climb from 23rd to third in the DTM is usually impossible, but I got lucky, was in the right place at the right time, and managed to gain ten places in the first few laps. After that, my pace was very good, and with the late pit stop, which was absolutely great with a time of 5.9 seconds, I executed the overcut to reach the top. I am very happy with fifth place in the driver standings in my first year with BMW M Motorsport, especially considering I had to skip a weekend. It wasn't easy at the beginning to adjust to a new car and a new team, but overall, it went really well.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “Both the race and the entire season were bittersweet for me. A podium was still within reach at the end, but unfortunately, it didn't quite happen. Overall, this year, we didn't always maximise our potential, even though the team did a great job. Congratulations to Thomas Preining on winning the title! He had a fantastic season.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 BMW M4 GT3, Project 1): “This was my worst DTM season in eleven years, and I'm honestly glad it's over. It's extremely unfortunate that we couldn't show the fans and ourselves what we set out to achieve. We had two reasonably good race weekends at Zandvoort and Spielberg, but otherwise, we have to admit that as a new team in this high-calibre field, we were simply out of contention. Personally, this is very frustrating for me because I have higher expectations. I am now looking forward to the winter break. After that, we'll see what challenges await me in 2024.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Customer Racing, BMW M Motorsport, GT Racing"}]}

The 2023 DTM season came to a close at the Hockenheimring (GER), with an impressive crowd of 88,000 spectators. René Rast (GER) treated fans to a remarkable comeback in the Sunday race, climbing from 23rd on the grid to secure a third-place finish. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) wrapped up his last DTM race for now with the number 1 finishing in fourth place. He had already congratulated his successor, Thomas Preining (AUT, Porsche), for his title win after the qualifying session. Marco Wittmann (GER) concluded a disappointing for him season with ninth and 17th-place finishes in the two Hockenheim races.\n\nSchubert Motorsport managed to secure two season wins and a total of eight podium finishes after 16 races. Van der Linde finished the season in fourth place in the driver standings with 151 points, closely followed by Rast in fifth place with 140 points. This was a remarkable performance for Rast in his first season as a BMW M works driver, especially considering he missed the race weekend at Zandvoort (NED) due to a scheduling conflict. Schubert Motorsport finished fourth in the team standings, and Wittmann concluded his eleventh DTM season in 13th place in the overall rankings.\n\nFrom BMW M Motorsport's perspective, the highlights of the year were the race weekends at the Norisring (GER) and the Red Bull Ring (AUT). Van der Linde secured his only season win at the city race in Nürnberg (GER) and finished third in the second race. Rast achieved his first podium finishes as a BMW M works driver by securing second place in both races. He celebrated his first victory in the BMW M4 GT3 at Spielberg (AUT), where van der Linde sealed a one-two victory for Schubert Motorsport on Sunday. Unfortunately, Wittmann missed out on a podium finish in the 2023 season. He finished fourth in the Sunday races at Zandvoort (NED) and Spielberg as part of the new Project 1 team.\n\nReactions on the DTM season finale:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The final race of the DTM season in front of this fantastic crowd at Hockenheim ended on a positive note with third and fourth places for René Rast and Sheldon van der Linde. René’s comeback from 23rd place to third was truly impressive! Overall, we cannot be satisfied with our performance in the DTM this time. When you start the year as the defending champion in the driver and team standings, you naturally want to repeat that success. In the 2023 season, we didn't manage to show consistent performance at all race weekends for various reasons with the BMW M4 GT3.

MINI's fully electric future will start in 2023 with, among other things, the new MINI Countryman at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig. This will be the first time that a MINI model is produced entirely in Germany. The locally emission-free all-rounder is an excellent fit for the BMW Group's sustainable production site in Leipzig, one of the most modern and sustainable automotive factories in the world. As the company's pilot project for establishing a \"green plant,\" a long-term, sustainable strategy for energy generation and consumption comes into play here. \"We are looking forward to handing over the first MINI \"Made in Germany\" to our customers. The new, all-electric MINI Countryman demonstrates what the brand stands for: electrified go-kart feeling and a strong focus on a minimal environmental footprint,\" says Stefanie Wurst, Head of MINI. Petra Peterhaensel as Plant Director and Sonja Hengstler as Project Manager for the new MINI Countryman are responsible in Leipzig for the transformation toward more electromobility and sustainable production of the E-components as well as the entire vehicles. A core workforce of 5,600 employees produces around 1,000 vehicles every day. The new MINI Countryman comes off the production line in Leipzig together with the BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé and BMW 2 Series Active Tourer. This makes the location the first plant at which vehicles of the BMW and MINI brands are manufactured together, once again demonstrating maximum flexibility. Electromobility as a driver. The expansion of electromobility is an integral part of the BMW Group's sustainability strategy. Today, one in five MINI models is already electrified, a testament to MINI fans' enthusiasm for locally emission-free driving fun. The next major milestone and stimulus for the plant is the production of the new MINI Countryman, which will roll off the production line in Leipzig from the end of this year. The high-voltage batteries for the all-electric MINI Countryman will then come from the plant's own production facilities. To this end, the BMW Group is expanding its capacities for e-component production at the Leipzig site by eight production lines by 2024 and investing more than 800 million euros. The future production area of 150,000 square meters on which E-components will be manufactured represents a sustainable investment in the future viability of the Leipzig plant. The expansion is associated with job security and even job growth. By 2024, more than 1,000 employees are to be employed in E-component production. Long-term commitment to sustainability.Sustainability is in the genes of the plant Leipzig. Part of the energy required for automotive production can be generated by four wind turbines 190 meters high directly on the Leipzig plant site. In 2021, 21.9 GWh of electricity was generated from wind power. This corresponds to the annual electricity consumption of over 5,000 3-person households. Since 2017, the electricity generated can be temporarily stored in the battery storage farm in up to 700 high-voltage batteries from BMW i3 models. \"Our Leipzig vision is the complete decarbonization of production by replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen. At the BMW Group plant in Leipzig, we are the first automotive plant in the world to use a newly developed burner technology in our paint shop that can use green hydrogen instead of natural gas.

Dense fog was the dominant theme at the 52nd edition of the 24h Nürburgring (GER). Only just under seven and a half hours could be driven under regular conditions, followed by a break of over 14 hours, before the race ended after five formation laps behind the safety car. As a result, the #72 BMW M4 GT3 of BMW M Team RMG, which started from pole position and with good chances of victory, was ultimately classified in third place. The result is provisional, and the official final result is still pending. The car, in the design of BMW M Motorsport Premium Technology Partner Shell, was shared by the three BMW M Motorsport Gen2K drivers Max Hesse (GER), Dan Harper (GBR), and Charles Weerts (BEL). The ROWE Racing #98 BMW M4 GT3 driven by Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Marco Wittmann (GER), Maxime Martin (BEL), and Augusto Farfus (BRA) was classified in seventh position. The ROWE Racing #99 BMW M4 GT3, in which Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), Robin Frijns (NED), and Farfus took turns, led the race in the early stages but retired after an unavoidable accident.\n\nJust before the start, the 24-hour race was already typically turbulent. It began to rain on the starting grid, and tyre choice became a lottery. In the pole car, the #72 BMW M4 GT3, starting driver Harper came into the pits after the formation lap to switch to drying wets, as did Wittmann in the #98 BMW M4 GT3. Meanwhile, Farfus in the #99 had already started on those tyres and sprinted from seventh on the grid to the front of the field within 20 minutes. Behind him, Harper and Wittmann also gained position after position and worked their way back to the front. After about two hours of racing, the first driver changes took place.\n\nVan der Linde took over the #99 car and continued to fight at the front. However, in the fourth hour of the race, the leading BMW M4 GT3 was forced to retire through no fault of its own. While lapping, van der Linde was hit on the left rear by a slower car and collided with another car. The fight for victory ended in the track barrier.\n\nThe focus then shifted to the other two BMW M4 GT3s which were still promisingly positioned in the race. As the fog on the Nordschleife thickened, the race was suspended at 23:22, with car #72 in second place and #98 in seventh. After more than 14 hours, at 13:30 on Sunday afternoon, the field went back on track behind the safety car for five formation laps. The order of the cars was based on the standings of the race in the lap in which the class leader had crossed the finish line for the penultimate time before the red flag. The minimum pitstop times that had accrued at that point were also taken into account. For the #72, that meant third place, and for the #98, eighth place. Eventually, the race director decided that the race would not be restarted after the five formation laps. The #72 remained in third place, and the #98, which had made a pit stop, finished in seventh place.\n\nIn the other classes of the 24-hour race, BMW M Motorsport teams achieved nine victories. In the SP10 class, FK Performance Motorsport celebrated a one-two triumph with the BMW M4 GT4. In the SP8T class, the BMW M4 GT4 even took all three podium places. First place went, among others, to the two former BMW M works drivers Timo Glock and Timo Scheider (both GER).\n\nAn overview of all class winners:\n\nComments after the 24h Nürburgring:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): “It was a very short 24-hour race, with seven and a half hours of racing. We were doing great with all three cars. The drivers and the teams did a great job. We were unlucky when Sheldon, who was leading, had to retire through no fault of his own. After that, the other two cars flew our flag very high. It's a pity that the race was not restarted. I would have liked to see where we would have ended up. We were highly motivated.”\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “This was an extremely unusual 24-hour race on the Nordschleife. The bad weather was very unfortunate for the participants and especially for the 240,000 fans on site. We had chances to win with all three BMW M4 GT3s. We laid the foundation with a fantastic qualifying, in which Max Hesse became the youngest driver ever to secure pole position. Unfortunately, we lost the leading #99 early on through no fault of our own. Then the fog came, and we could no longer use the good performance of our BMW M4 GT3 and the excellent work of the teams. A big thank you to all BMW M works drivers, BMW M Team RMG and ROWE Racing, and our BMW M Motorsport employees who once again faced the challenges of the Green Hell. Congratulations also to all BMW teams that were successful in the individual classes.”\n\nMax Hesse (#72 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team RMG): “I have mixed feelings. Of course, we are super happy that we finished and are on the podium with P3. We would have liked to make more use of our pace, but we couldn't race again today, although it must be said that we were a bit lucky because other cars went to the pits. If it had been a green flag, it might have been difficult for us with the fuel but we are on the podium, although of course, we would have liked to have landed two steps higher.”\n\nDan Harper (#72 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team RMG): “P3 in the 24h Nürburgring, I think it’s an amazing result for us. It has been the first time with Charles as part of the team. It was fantastic to be back with BMW M Team RMG; we have been competitive the whole week and been at the front. BMW M Team RMG and BMW M Motorsport gave us an amazing car It’s a shame with the conditions as the race was stopped for most of the time and we could not really get back racing. But we came away with the podium and it’s a great feeling.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#72 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team RMG): “I’m very happy to finish third in my first ever 24h Nürburgring on the Nordschleife. If I would have known this before I would have been of course extremely happy. It was quite a special race with a lot of time under the red flag which is not something we want to have as a racer and as the spectators, but today it was safety first and it was probably the right call. We don’t know how the race would have finished without the red flag. We could have won it, maybe we would not have been on the podium. Now we finished third, a big thank you to BMW M Motorsport, to BMW M Team RMG and to my team-mates who were incredible during the whole weekend.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#99 BMW M4 GT3, ROWE Racing): “My heart hurts after such an accident, and it wasn't my fault. If I were in that situation again, I would do exactly the same thing. I believe the driver in the other car didn't see me. I was in her blind spot as I passed. I was almost past, and then she hit me on the left rear. Then I hit another car that was completely uninvolved, and that's how it happened. A racing incident. But at the end of the day, we were out after leading for so long and that hurts, also for the team, which puts so much work into it. We work almost half a year towards a 24-hour race, and then it goes so wrong.”\n\nVideo statements for editorial use.\n\nWe also provide video statements for editorial use from the 24h Nürburgring.

Dense fog was the dominant theme at the 52nd edition of the 24h Nürburgring (GER). Only just under seven and a half hours could be driven under regular conditions, followed by a break of over 14 hours, before the race ended after five formation laps behind the safety car. As a result, the #72 BMW M4 GT3 of BMW M Team RMG, which started from pole position and with good chances of victory, was ultimately classified in third place. The result is provisional, and the official final result is still pending. The car, in the design of BMW M Motorsport Premium Technology Partner Shell, was shared by the three BMW M Motorsport Gen2K drivers Max Hesse (GER), Dan Harper (GBR), and Charles Weerts (BEL). The ROWE Racing #98 BMW M4 GT3 driven by Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Marco Wittmann (GER), Maxime Martin (BEL), and Augusto Farfus (BRA) was classified in seventh position. The ROWE Racing #99 BMW M4 GT3, in which Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), Robin Frijns (NED), and Farfus took turns, led the race in the early stages but retired after an unavoidable accident.\n\nJust before the start, the 24-hour race was already typically turbulent. It began to rain on the starting grid, and tyre choice became a lottery. In the pole car, the #72 BMW M4 GT3, starting driver Harper came into the pits after the formation lap to switch to drying wets, as did Wittmann in the #98 BMW M4 GT3. Meanwhile, Farfus in the #99 had already started on those tyres and sprinted from seventh on the grid to the front of the field within 20 minutes. Behind him, Harper and Wittmann also gained position after position and worked their way back to the front. After about two hours of racing, the first driver changes took place.\n\nVan der Linde took over the #99 car and continued to fight at the front. However, in the fourth hour of the race, the leading BMW M4 GT3 was forced to retire through no fault of its own. While lapping, van der Linde was hit on the left rear by a slower car and collided with another car. The fight for victory ended in the track barrier.\n\nThe focus then shifted to the other two BMW M4 GT3s which were still promisingly positioned in the race. As the fog on the Nordschleife thickened, the race was suspended at 23:22, with car #72 in second place and #98 in seventh. After more than 14 hours, at 13:30 on Sunday afternoon, the field went back on track behind the safety car for five formation laps. The order of the cars was based on the standings of the race in the lap in which the class leader had crossed the finish line for the penultimate time before the red flag. The minimum pitstop times that had accrued at that point were also taken into account. For the #72, that meant third place, and for the #98, eighth place. Eventually, the race director decided that the race would not be restarted after the five formation laps. The #72 remained in third place, and the #98, which had made a pit stop, finished in seventh place.\n\nIn the other classes of the 24-hour race, BMW M Motorsport teams achieved nine victories. In the SP10 class, FK Performance Motorsport celebrated a one-two triumph with the BMW M4 GT4. In the SP8T class, the BMW M4 GT4 even took all three podium places. First place went, among others, to the two former BMW M works drivers Timo Glock and Timo Scheider (both GER).\n\nAn overview of all class winners:\n\nComments after the 24h Nürburgring:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): “It was a very short 24-hour race, with seven and a half hours of racing. We were doing great with all three cars. The drivers and the teams did a great job. We were unlucky when Sheldon, who was leading, had to retire through no fault of his own. After that, the other two cars flew our flag very high. It's a pity that the race was not restarted. I would have liked to see where we would have ended up. We were highly motivated.”\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “This was an extremely unusual 24-hour race on the Nordschleife. The bad weather was very unfortunate for the participants and especially for the 240,000 fans on site. We had chances to win with all three BMW M4 GT3s. We laid the foundation with a fantastic qualifying, in which Max Hesse became the youngest driver ever to secure pole position. Unfortunately, we lost the leading #99 early on through no fault of our own. Then the fog came, and we could no longer use the good performance of our BMW M4 GT3 and the excellent work of the teams. A big thank you to all BMW M works drivers, BMW M Team RMG and ROWE Racing, and our BMW M Motorsport employees who once again faced the challenges of the Green Hell. Congratulations also to all BMW teams that were successful in the individual classes.”\n\nMax Hesse (#72 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team RMG): “I have mixed feelings. Of course, we are super happy that we finished and are on the podium with P3. We would have liked to make more use of our pace, but we couldn't race again today, although it must be said that we were a bit lucky because other cars went to the pits. If it had been a green flag, it might have been difficult for us with the fuel but we are on the podium, although of course, we would have liked to have landed two steps higher.”\n\nDan Harper (#72 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team RMG): “P3 in the 24h Nürburgring, I think it’s an amazing result for us. It has been the first time with Charles as part of the team. It was fantastic to be back with BMW M Team RMG; we have been competitive the whole week and been at the front. BMW M Team RMG and BMW M Motorsport gave us an amazing car It’s a shame with the conditions as the race was stopped for most of the time and we could not really get back racing. But we came away with the podium and it’s a great feeling.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#72 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team RMG): “I’m very happy to finish third in my first ever 24h Nürburgring on the Nordschleife. If I would have known this before I would have been of course extremely happy. It was quite a special race with a lot of time under the red flag which is not something we want to have as a racer and as the spectators, but today it was safety first and it was probably the right call. We don’t know how the race would have finished without the red flag. We could have won it, maybe we would not have been on the podium. Now we finished third, a big thank you to BMW M Motorsport, to BMW M Team RMG and to my team-mates who were incredible during the whole weekend.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#99 BMW M4 GT3, ROWE Racing): “My heart hurts after such an accident, and it wasn't my fault. If I were in that situation again, I would do exactly the same thing. I believe the driver in the other car didn't see me. I was in her blind spot as I passed. I was almost past, and then she hit me on the left rear. Then I hit another car that was completely uninvolved, and that's how it happened. A racing incident. But at the end of the day, we were out after leading for so long and that hurts, also for the team, which puts so much work into it. We work almost half a year towards a 24-hour race, and then it goes so wrong.”\n\nVideo statements for editorial use.\n\nWe also provide video statements for editorial use from the 24h Nürburgring.

The third round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship 2024 (WorldSBK) brings BMW Motorrad Motorsport to the ‘Cathedral of Speed’. From 19th to 21st April, WorldSBK visits the famous Assen TT Circuit, Netherlands. Following a successful season start with wins and podium finishes for BMW Motorrad factory rider Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, the goal is to bring the BMW M 1000 RR onto the podium at Assen as well.\n\nAssen is the home race for Razgatlioglu’s teammate, BMW Motorrad factory rider Michael van der Mark (NED), who recently showed his return to the top field with top-four results at Barcelona (ESP). The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team can also consider the round in the Netherlands a home race, as its team base in northern German Cuxhaven is only two and a half hours away from Assen. The team aims to continue where it left off in race two at Barcelona and to fight for the top ten with both BMW Motorrad factory riders Garrett Gerloff (USA) and Scott Redding (GBR).\n\nQuotes ahead of the Assen round.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Assen is always something special. The circuit has a long history, and the enthusiasm of the fans there is always great. The first two race weekends of the season have gone excellently, and accordingly, we come to Assen with a lot of optimism. We have shown on tracks that don’t necessarily suit us well how competitive the BMW M 1000 RR is, not only with Toprak’s wins and podiums, but with good results for our entire WorldSBK squad. However, we do not rest on our laurels, but we all work hard to continue this path at Assen. The past races have once again confirmed how tight it is in WorldSBK, but our goal is to be contenders in the top field at Assen as well.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff (#31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “I’m looking forward to Assen. It’s a track that I really enjoy and a track that I feel that I flow very well with. I think also that with some of the changes we have made with the bike it will be a good track for the BMW M 1000 RR and something that I can flow on. I’m looking forward to getting to the track and to seeing my team again after a couple of weeks off and putting our heads down and try to do the best we can.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#54 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “I am very happy to come back to Assen again. We don’t know yet how the weather will be, but it is always a bit difficult there. It looks like it will be cold and with maybe some rain; we will see. It’s Mickey’s home race and maybe he can help me a little bit because it’s my first time there with BMW and Mickey is always strong there so maybe he can help me with some lines and some data. We are always working together and I am very happy for that. My target is to fight for the podium again, but I am there with the BMW M 1000 RR for the first time and maybe my feeling is very good and I will be fighting for the win. We will see at the race weekend. In general I am happy, and as it is Mickey’s home race, I hope that we finish the race on the podium together. I am ready, I keep training every day, and I was pushing especially in the past five days with training two or three times per day. I’m feeling really ready to fight, and everyone in the team works a lot. This is also a very good motivation for me. We have done a very good job so far and I think we can also do so at Assen. We will see at the race weekend.”\n\nScott Redding (#45 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “I’m really looking forward to Assen. It is a track that I really love! A lot of history there and I enjoy racing on circuits like this. This weekend I am hoping for more potentially after finding some good directions at the end of the Barcelona race weekend. I hope for good weather and I look forward to seeing all the fans at the Cathedral of Speed.”\n\nMichael van der Mark (#60 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It’s really nice to come to Assen, my home round, and I think that we come there at the right time. We had two very good rounds before arriving at Assen with a lot of confidence which is always nice so I’m looking forward to it. It will be a busy weekend for me with a lot of friends and family but it’s great. It’s only once a year so I will enjoy it and I think we’ve shown now that the base of the bike is really good and we can be really competitive.

The third round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship 2024 (WorldSBK) brings BMW Motorrad Motorsport to the ‘Cathedral of Speed’. From 19th to 21st April, WorldSBK visits the famous Assen TT Circuit, Netherlands. Following a successful season start with wins and podium finishes for BMW Motorrad factory rider Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, the goal is to bring the BMW M 1000 RR onto the podium at Assen as well.\n\nAssen is the home race for Razgatlioglu’s teammate, BMW Motorrad factory rider Michael van der Mark (NED), who recently showed his return to the top field with top-four results at Barcelona (ESP). The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team can also consider the round in the Netherlands a home race, as its team base in northern German Cuxhaven is only two and a half hours away from Assen. The team aims to continue where it left off in race two at Barcelona and to fight for the top ten with both BMW Motorrad factory riders Garrett Gerloff (USA) and Scott Redding (GBR).\n\nQuotes ahead of the Assen round.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Assen is always something special. The circuit has a long history, and the enthusiasm of the fans there is always great. The first two race weekends of the season have gone excellently, and accordingly, we come to Assen with a lot of optimism. We have shown on tracks that don’t necessarily suit us well how competitive the BMW M 1000 RR is, not only with Toprak’s wins and podiums, but with good results for our entire WorldSBK squad. However, we do not rest on our laurels, but we all work hard to continue this path at Assen. The past races have once again confirmed how tight it is in WorldSBK, but our goal is to be contenders in the top field at Assen as well.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff (#31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “I’m looking forward to Assen. It’s a track that I really enjoy and a track that I feel that I flow very well with. I think also that with some of the changes we have made with the bike it will be a good track for the BMW M 1000 RR and something that I can flow on. I’m looking forward to getting to the track and to seeing my team again after a couple of weeks off and putting our heads down and try to do the best we can.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#54 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “I am very happy to come back to Assen again. We don’t know yet how the weather will be, but it is always a bit difficult there. It looks like it will be cold and with maybe some rain; we will see. It’s Mickey’s home race and maybe he can help me a little bit because it’s my first time there with BMW and Mickey is always strong there so maybe he can help me with some lines and some data. We are always working together and I am very happy for that. My target is to fight for the podium again, but I am there with the BMW M 1000 RR for the first time and maybe my feeling is very good and I will be fighting for the win. We will see at the race weekend. In general I am happy, and as it is Mickey’s home race, I hope that we finish the race on the podium together. I am ready, I keep training every day, and I was pushing especially in the past five days with training two or three times per day. I’m feeling really ready to fight, and everyone in the team works a lot. This is also a very good motivation for me. We have done a very good job so far and I think we can also do so at Assen. We will see at the race weekend.”\n\nScott Redding (#45 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “I’m really looking forward to Assen. It is a track that I really love!

The fourth DTM race event of the season at the Norisring (GER) was German René Rast’s weekend. In the Saturday race, he used his full experience in the rain gamble of Nürnberg (GER), made the right tyre choice, and celebrated his first season victory in the Schubert Motorsport #33 BMW M4 GT3. His performance on Sunday was equally strong. Starting from 19th place and with 20 kilograms of success ballast, he stormed up to fifth position and collected valuable points in the DTM title race. At the halfway point of the season, Rast is third in the drivers' standings with 93 points, while Schubert Motorsport leads the team standings with 186 points. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER) also scored points .\n\nBefore full stands on the city circuit at the Dutzendteich, Rast drove from seventh on the grid to victory in the first race, because when the rain began, unlike nearly all the other drivers, he did not come in for a tyre change but instead weathered the brief shower on slicks. Thanks to the saved pit stop, he was unstoppable on his way to his 27th DTM win. After two third-places in 2022 and two second-places in 2023, it was the fifth consecutive podium for Rast at the Norisring. Although the series ended with a fifth place on Sunday, his comeback over 14 positions was such strong damage limitation that it felt like another podium. After eight of 16 season races, Rast is just eleven points behind the leader in the overall standings with his 93 points. Schubert Motorsport has a 16-point advantage over second place in the team standings.\n\nFor Rast’s teammates Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER), the weekend did not go optimally. Van der Linde had strong pace in the #31 BMW M4 GT3 and started the Saturday race from the front row. However, he fell back to seventh place in the rain gamble with victory in sight. On Sunday, the 2022 DTM champion was classified in 14th place after a penalty. Wittmann, celebrated by fans at his home game in Nürnberg, could not match his great victory at Zandvoort (NED) a few weeks ago. He finished in twelfth and eleventh places in the #11 BMW M4 GT3.\n\nADAC GT4 Germany: 1-2-3 for the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nIn ADAC GT4 Germany, BMW M Motorsport teams celebrated a 1-2-3 on Saturday. Gabriele Piana (ITA) and Michael Schrey (GER) in the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport #2 BMW M4 GT4 took their fourth season win and thus extended their lead in the overall standings. Their teammates Tim Reiter and Leon Wassertheurer (both GER) finished third. Leyton Fourie (RSA) and Max Rosam (GER) in the #46 BMW M4 GT4 from FK Performance Motorsport squeezed into second place. On Sunday, the BMW M Motorsport teams had a much harder time. Piana and Schrey finished in eighth place as the best-placed crew. In the team standings, Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport is at the top.\n\nComments after the races:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): “As always at the Norisring, it was a great weekend. The atmosphere was fantastic – and the performances of the BMW M4 GT3, our drivers, and the Schubert team were top-notch. René Rast's victory on Saturday and his comeback on Sunday stand out, but overall I am very satisfied with our performances.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “Saturday here at the Norisring was fantastic in every respect. With the victory for René Rast in the DTM and the triple podium for the BMW M4 GT4 in the ADAC GT4 Germany, everything just came together. DTM qualifying on Sunday was not so good, but we can be proud of how our guys fought in the race. René Rast from 19 to five – and Sheldon van der Linde also took important points in both races. That's exactly what it's all about if you want to win the title at the end of the year. Unfortunately, Marco Wittmann had a bit of bad luck at his home game, but we all push together in the second half of the season.”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “Overall, we achieved strong results this weekend and are very well placed with two cars in the drivers' standings and also in the team standings at the halfway point of the season. René Rast's victory on Saturday was great. A bit of luck was also involved because if it had rained a little more, it would not have been him at the front, but Sheldon van der Linde, for whom we had strategically bet on more rain. On Sunday we had problems getting the tyres into the right window – especially in qualifying, but also in the race at times. Nevertheless, we drove into the top ten again. Why it didn't work out so well for Marco Wittmann, we have to analyse.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3): “A gigantic weekend! I would not have thought it possible to leave Nürnberg with a win, a fifth place, and third place in the drivers' standings, just eleven points behind. On Saturday, my decision not to switch to rain tyres was spot on. The race on Sunday from the last row could not have gone better. I had a great first lap and also benefited a little from penalties for others. But still, making up so many places in a DTM race is incredible.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 GT3): “It was a weekend of 'could have, would have, should have.' On Saturday, the victory slipped through our fingers due to the difficult conditions. That would have been extremely good for me in the championship, but it was not to be. On Sunday, there was no more to be had in qualifying, and in the end, the race was tough. But that's how it is sometimes. Next up is the Nürburgring in August.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3): “The atmosphere at my home event was once again great. It makes me proud to have such a fan base behind me. All the more frustrating is that I couldn't excite the spectators with good results on the track. Overall, it was a super weekend for the team, but I had hoped for more personally. We now have to analyse why I couldn't keep up with the pace of my teammates here and get the problem under control with a view to the second half of the season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fourth DTM race event of the season at the Norisring (GER) was German René Rast’s weekend.

But still, making up so many places in a DTM race is incredible.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 GT3): “It was a weekend of 'could have, would have, should have.' On Saturday, the victory slipped through our fingers due to the difficult conditions. That would have been extremely good for me in the championship, but it was not to be. On Sunday, there was no more to be had in qualifying, and in the end, the race was tough. But that's how it is sometimes. Next up is the Nürburgring in August.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3): “The atmosphere at my home event was once again great. It makes me proud to have such a fan base behind me. All the more frustrating is that I couldn't excite the spectators with good results on the track. Overall, it was a super weekend for the team, but I had hoped for more personally. We now have to analyse why I couldn't keep up with the pace of my teammates here and get the problem under control with a view to the second half of the season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

BMW M Motorsport experienced the full range of emotions that this legendary event has to offer during its comeback in the top class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) after 25 years. After a turbulent race under challenging weather conditions, Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR) in the Team WRT #31 BMW M4 GT3 celebrated second place on the LMGT3 podium. It was the first time since 2011 that a BMW crew has celebrated on the podium at Le Mans. In the Hypercar class, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 and the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car had strong pace but were – like the #46 BMW M4 GT3 – taken out of the race by accidents .\n\nVideo: Statements from Andreas Roos, Vincent Vosse, and the #31 drivers: .\n\nBMW M Motorsport celebrated its return to the mecca of endurance racing with an extensive programme for fans and guests. The focus was on the 20th BMW Art Car, the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 designed by artist Julie Mehretu, and on the sporting performance of BMW M Team WRT, which is fielding two Hypercars and two LMGT3 cars at Le Mans and throughout the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season.\n\nA spectacular week began with scrutineering in the city centre and ended on Sunday after 24 turbulent racing hours with a podium for the #31 BMW M4 GT3 in the LMGT3 category. Farfus, Gelael, and Leung maintained their composure despite adverse weather conditions including occasional heavy rain showers that even led to a multi-hour safety car period during the night. They made no mistakes and were rewarded with second place. The trio, which won the 6 Hours of Imola (ITA) earlier this season, is the first BMW crew since 2011 to make it onto the podium at Le Mans. The sister #46 car, driven by Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), was very well placed in the race for the LMGT3 victory before Al Harthy slid into the track barrier on a wet track during the night.\n\nIn the Hypercar class, both car crews, after strong pace in all sessions, could not fulfill hopes for top places. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, which had made it to Hyperpole thanks to Dries Vanthoor's (BEL) fastest qualifying time, retired after a severe accident on Saturday evening. Vanthoor was pushed off the track by a Ferrari at around 300 km/h on the straight and hit the track barrier hard. Fortunately, Vanthoor was unharmed, but the race was over for the car, which had been making its way back into the top ten after an early spin. The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car had also fought its way into the top ten from 16th on the grid when Robin Frijns (NED) lost control and crashed into the tyre barriers. To honour the Art Car project and reward the WRT team for their hard work, the car returned to the track shortly before the end after a long repair break and crossed the finish line.\n\nComments after the 24 Hours of Le Mans:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): “It was a very emotional weekend for the entire BMW M community. There were many ups and downs, but that has only brought us all closer together. The first hours of the race were difficult with mistakes and accidents, and we quickly lost three of our four cars. With united strength, however, we got the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car back on track so it could resume the race at the end and cross the finish line. For the #31 BMW M4 GT3, there was second place in the end. It was the first podium for BMW at Le Mans since 2011. That was a conciliatory end on the sporting side. On the customer and community side, we had great experiences with the new BMW M5 in the Closed Room as well as with the new BMW M2 update and the BMW M4 CS. All in all, we experienced great moments together, it was a great event.”\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The 24 Hours of Le Mans 2024 were definitely a rollercoaster of emotions. We had a great start with first place for the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 in qualifying. Also, in the race itself, we had a good start, but unfortunately, we then made mistakes, especially in the first hours, where we lost the our Hypercars’ good positions. However, we fought back with one car, number 15, into the leading group. Unfortunately, there was an unavoidable accident in which Dries Vanthoor was hit at high speed. Fortunately, Dries was unharmed, and that was the most important thing. On the GT3 side, the race was especially difficult at night due to the varying weather conditions. Unfortunately, we also lost the #46 due to an accident but the #31 fought its way back to the top with a strong team performance. We raced for the win until the end and finished second. It was a great debut for our BMW M4 GT3 at the 24-hour race at Le Mans. Many thanks for the huge effort that BMW M Team WRT, all drivers, BMW M Motorsport, and all participants have made here.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “I am not at all disappointed with our performance with the Hypercars, but with the results. Somehow it was not our weekend. After we lost the #46 in the LMGT3 class, all our hopes were on number 31. They did an incredible job – drivers, mechanics, and engineers. They fought very hard, and we finished second after 24 hours. That is a great success.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#31 BMW M4 GT3): “I think if we look at how our performance was at the start of the race and where we finished, we have a lot of reasons to celebrate. It shows how important it is to have an incredible team, and that good processes within a team lead to good results. We were the last BMW in the field and we brought home the podium. That is the deserved reward for everyone at Team WRT and BMW. We are very close to the lead in the championship, so we remain focused and set our sights on winning the title.”\n\nSean Gelael (#31 BMW M4 GT3): “Le Mans is always a very special event with its atmosphere, history, and more than 300,000 spectators. It's great to be part of the fantastic BMW and WRT family that works tirelessly so that we can be successful. We made the most of the performance available to us this weekend. We fought for the win and in the end achieved a good second place. We are happy to take that.”\n\nDarren Leung (#31 BMW M4 GT3): “This is something very special. If someone had told me at the beginning of the weekend that we would finish second, I would have been very surprised. This is the result of good teamwork, good strategy, good people on the car – and the support of a manufacturer like BMW that takes the risk of employing a relative newcomer like me. Such successes as we've had this season are flattering at first, but they also raise one's own expectations. Now I want to win the world championship.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#15 BMW M Hybrid V8): “Being taken out of the race by such an accident is very disappointing. The most important thing is that Dries was not injured because such a crash at around 300 km/h is extremely dangerous and can have much worse consequences. At that point in the race, after my mistake in the opening phase, we had already fought our way back into the top-ten and were doing well. Then, after many weeks of intensive preparation, to be essentially out before midnight with both Hypercars is, of course, extremely frustrating for the entire team. What remains for me are the impressions of this unique Le Mans vibe, this incredible atmosphere at this event, which I was able to experience for the first time.”\n\nRené Rast (#20 BMW M Hybrid V8): “Being at Le Mans is always the highlight of the year. For me, it was a very special honour to start as a driver of the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car. The parade on Friday was as fantastically crazy as every year. From a sporting perspective, the race result was, of course, anything but satisfactory, as we had expected much more. We simply didn't implement it well and made too many mistakes. We need to improve on that.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3): “In the first part of the race, we were very competitive. We were able to make up many positions thanks to good strategy and strong pace. We led the race for two to three hours, and I really enjoyed driving in first place. Unfortunately, the conditions then worsened, and Ahmad made a mistake with slicks on a wet track, which forced us to retire. That is a shame.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport experienced the full range of emotions that this legendary event has to offer during its comeback in the top class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) after 25 years.

For the #31 BMW M4 GT3, there was second place in the end. It was the first podium for BMW at Le Mans since 2011. That was a conciliatory end on the sporting side. On the customer and community side, we had great experiences with the new BMW M5 in the Closed Room as well as with the new BMW M2 update and the BMW M4 CS. All in all, we experienced great moments together, it was a great event.”\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The 24 Hours of Le Mans 2024 were definitely a rollercoaster of emotions. We had a great start with first place for the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 in qualifying. Also, in the race itself, we had a good start, but unfortunately, we then made mistakes, especially in the first hours, where we lost the our Hypercars’ good positions. However, we fought back with one car, number 15, into the leading group. Unfortunately, there was an unavoidable accident in which Dries Vanthoor was hit at high speed. Fortunately, Dries was unharmed, and that was the most important thing. On the GT3 side, the race was especially difficult at night due to the varying weather conditions. Unfortunately, we also lost the #46 due to an accident but the #31 fought its way back to the top with a strong team performance. We raced for the win until the end and finished second. It was a great debut for our BMW M4 GT3 at the 24-hour race at Le Mans. Many thanks for the huge effort that BMW M Team WRT, all drivers, BMW M Motorsport, and all participants have made here.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “I am not at all disappointed with our performance with the Hypercars, but with the results. Somehow it was not our weekend. After we lost the #46 in the LMGT3 class, all our hopes were on number 31. They did an incredible job – drivers, mechanics, and engineers. They fought very hard, and we finished second after 24 hours. That is a great success.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#31 BMW M4 GT3): “I think if we look at how our performance was at the start of the race and where we finished, we have a lot of reasons to celebrate. It shows how important it is to have an incredible team, and that good processes within a team lead to good results. We were the last BMW in the field and we brought home the podium. That is the deserved reward for everyone at Team WRT and BMW. We are very close to the lead in the championship, so we remain focused and set our sights on winning the title.”\n\nSean Gelael (#31 BMW M4 GT3): “Le Mans is always a very special event with its atmosphere, history, and more than 300,000 spectators. It's great to be part of the fantastic BMW and WRT family that works tirelessly so that we can be successful. We made the most of the performance available to us this weekend. We fought for the win and in the end achieved a good second place. We are happy to take that.”\n\nDarren Leung (#31 BMW M4 GT3): “This is something very special. If someone had told me at the beginning of the weekend that we would finish second, I would have been very surprised. This is the result of good teamwork, good strategy, good people on the car – and the support of a manufacturer like BMW that takes the risk of employing a relative newcomer like me. Such successes as we've had this season are flattering at first, but they also raise one's own expectations. Now I want to win the world championship.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#15 BMW M Hybrid V8): “Being taken out of the race by such an accident is very disappointing. The most important thing is that Dries was not injured because such a crash at around 300 km/h is extremely dangerous and can have much worse consequences. At that point in the race, after my mistake in the opening phase, we had already fought our way back into the top-ten and were doing well. Then, after many weeks of intensive preparation, to be essentially out before midnight with both Hypercars is, of course, extremely frustrating for the entire team. What remains for me are the impressions of this unique Le Mans vibe, this incredible atmosphere at this event, which I was able to experience for the first time.”\n\nRené Rast (#20 BMW M Hybrid V8): “Being at Le Mans is always the highlight of the year. For me, it was a very special honour to start as a driver of the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car. The parade on Friday was as fantastically crazy as every year. From a sporting perspective, the race result was, of course, anything but satisfactory, as we had expected much more. We simply didn't implement it well and made too many mistakes. We need to improve on that.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3): “In the first part of the race, we were very competitive. We were able to make up many positions thanks to good strategy and strong pace. We led the race for two to three hours, and I really enjoyed driving in first place. Unfortunately, the conditions then worsened, and Ahmad made a mistake with slicks on a wet track, which forced us to retire. That is a shame.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at summarizing BMW news articles. Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nMunich. History-rich British brand MINI is taking a quantum leap into the digital age with its new model family. At the heart of the action is the iconic central instrument – the MINI Interaction Unit. The round OLED display, with its 240 mm diameter and rich colours, blends perfectly into the interior of the new MINI family. Its positioning within the cabin allows it to be used comfortably by the driver and front passenger.\n\n“We are taking a massive leap into the digital world with the new MINI family and, in so doing, underscoring the charismatic heritage of the brand. The iconic central display in the new MINI family is round and will be filled with round content for the first time. I am convinced that the digital power of the new models will delight MINI customers around the world,” says Stefanie Wurst, Head of the MINI brand.\n\nFrank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development: “We are presenting our all-new MINI family with a unique technology package. It is based on the latest tech stack from BMW and brings a very specific MINI flavour to signature brand-defining functions such as the Experience Modes and the voice assistant. The result is a display of cutting-edge digital fireworks with a sharp eye for detail.”\n\nAn overview of the digital highlights of the new MINI family*:\n\nThe new MINI Operating System 9 – optimised interaction for touch and voice control.\n\nThe new “Charismatic Simplicity” design language is also reflected in the aesthetic of the user interface, which brings together functional and emotional elements. The reduced design uses all-new graphics to create an extremely modern look. Static and dynamic elements blend naturally into the circular form of the OLED display, following a clear structure. Micro-animations enhance the already extremely intuitive interaction between the driver and central instrument and underscore the digital character of the new MINI family.\n\nMINI Operating System 9 is an in-house development by the BMW Group and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. Operation is intuitive and follows the standards familiar from consumer electronics.\n\nAt the centre of the screen is the start menu, where personalised content can be selected and launched by swiping to the side. In the lower section of the screen is the fixed status bar containing the menu items “Navigation”, “Media”, “Telephony”, “All Apps” and, depending on the situation, “Home”, which can be selected directly. Swiping up from the lower edge of the screen reveals a tool belt, a process customers will be familiar with from many consumer electronics devices. Favourite functions can be stored here and called up again rapidly, i. e. navigation destinations and radio stations. The tool belt can also be activated via the star button on the multifunction steering wheel. The upper screen area is reserved for driving-relevant content such as the vehicle speed and important information on the vehicle status. The optional Head-up display shows the most important information for the driver in their field of view.\n\nThe temperature for the driver and front passenger is permanently displayed on the left- and right-hand edge of the screen. The climate control settings are integrated into the MINI Interaction Unit and can always be adjusted on the top layer by touch or voice command.\n\nDepending on the Experience Mode selected, a single tap on the speed display transforms the entire MINI Interaction Unit into a MINI-typical speedometer.\n\nMINI Experience Modes for intensely MINI moments.\n\nThe emotional connection between the new MINIs and their drivers steps up another degree in intensity with the MINI Experience Modes. Standard specification includes the Core, Green and Go-Kart Modes, each of which has its own specific user interface design. The Experience Modes can optionally be taken to the next level by the additional, coordinated use of light and sound. Drivers can immerse themselves in up to eight different worlds in the interior of the new-generation MINIs thanks to the MINI Experience Modes, with a distinctive jingle for each Mode indicating it has been activated.\n\nThe MINI Interaction Unit displays different designs and content according to the mode selected. A standout feature of the interior experience is a fresh interpretation of the signature MINI interior lighting. An optional projector on the back of the OLED display bathes the dashboard in coordinated colour worlds and patterns. The interplay of the projection, ambient lighting and MINI Interaction Unit creates a unique, immersive experience that extends into the door trim.\n\nA particular highlight is Personal Mode, which breaks new ground in terms of personalisation and adjustability. It allows customers to turn their own pictures from their smartphone gallery into the background for the MINI Interaction Unit using the MINI App. The ambient lighting is set automatically in a colour that matches the picture selected.\n\nThe colour design in the optional Head-up display likewise adapts to the MINI Experience Mode selected. This also contributes to an emotionally engaging and consistent digital user experience.\n\nUnmistakable sound for all-electric MINI models.\n\nThe brand-typical soundscapes of the new MINI family are also part of the digital user experience. The spread of options includes all-new driving sounds in the interior, an unmistakable MINI brand sound to confirm the car’s identity from the outside, jingles for the new MINI Experience Modes and 30 new sound signals with information and warning functions.\n\nThe new sounds bring extra emotional appeal to the interior of the MINI and shape its acoustic statement to the world beyond. They provide the cars with a distinctive, MINI-typical identifying feature on an acoustic level. The first customers to experience the new sounds will be drivers of the new MINI Cooper Electric.\n\nThe new MINI sound DNA is based on the fundamental values of the brand and embodies a positive, charismatic aura. The MINI Experience Modes provide the stage on which the all-new soundscapes are performed. Familiar MINI sounds conveying information while also sparking emotions are generated using analogue instruments, digital technology and artificial intelligence. These MINI Experience Modes deliver immersive driving experiences.\n\nMINI Intelligent Personal Assistant – visually accompanied by “MINI” or “Spike”.\n\nThis is the first time a full-capability voice assistant will be included in models from the MINI brand. The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated using the greeting “Hey MINI” or by pressing the push-to-talk button on the steering wheel. The voice-controlled interaction on the circular OLED display takes place in the form of an animation made up of graphical elements, typography and an avatar. For the visualisation, users can choose between “MINI” – a stylised representation of a MINI – and optionally “Spike”, a familiar figure already to many MINI fans.\n\nMany important functions, such as navigation, telephony, radio and temperature, can be controlled by voice command. The driver can make travel-related requests or wishes, such as “What’s the weather in... /at my destination?” and “Show me charging stations along the route”. If the customer expresses a wish, e.g. “I’m hungry” or “I’d like a coffee”, relevant options in the vicinity are displayed and route guidance to the desired destination can be started directly. Two microphones at the front of the headliner enable the system to automatically detect whether it is the driver or front passenger currently speaking.\n\nThe brand-typical character of the MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be experienced by customers through chit-chat, which will bring up MINI-specific answers, jokes and stories. Such as the question “Do you like me” or “Tell me a joke”.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant will already be based on the Alexa Custom Assistant’s AI technology stack at market launch, allowing it to engage in natural dialogue with the driver with a brand-defining voice. In many other markets, the new voice and other features also enabled by using the Alexa Custom Assistant will be introduced at a later stage over the air.\n\nMINI Navigation: Fresh map designs and cloud-based navigation with charging-optimised route planning.\n\nThe cloud-based navigation system represents a major improvement in performance over the preceding generation and offers exceptionally intuitive destination entry. It enables very fast and dynamic route calculation based on precise real-time traffic data transmitted at short intervals, which is then combined with forecasting models. When the navigation app is selected, the map takes up the entirety of the circular display. The colour scheme for the map graphics changes to match the selected MINI Experience Mode, while buildings can also be shown in 3D if desired.\n\nIn all-electric MINI models, as soon as the destination has been entered, a charging-optimised route will be calculated if the vehicle’s current range is not enough to reach the destination. Both the calculation algorithm and the speed of calculation for charging-optimised routes are subject to a process of constant improvement. Important information for the charging stops is displayed in the route overview, such as the estimated state of charge upon arrival, recommended charging time and target state of charge for the onward journey. Live data is processed during the journey, allowing new charging stations to be automatically added to the itinerary if any of the stations originally planned for charging stops no longer have availability. The driver is also offered alternative charging-optimised routes, where available. By default, the system is set to ensure that the vehicle reaches both the final destination and the charging stops with a charge level of at least 10 per cent. Drivers are able to adjust this spare charge setting if required.\n\nCharging is also made easier by the integration of the authorisation and start/stop functions for the charging process into the MINI App.\n\nThe optional Augmented View function enables exceptionally accurate navigational guidance. It provides a perfect complement to the navigation system’s instructions in crucial situations. For this, a live video stream from the driver’s perspective is shown on the MINI Interaction Unit and augmented by supplementary information that matches the context. At confusing junctions, for instance, an animated directional arrow is integrated into the video image to help the driver take the best turn-off for the planned route. In addition to this, information on applicable local parking regulations also appears in the live video stream in augmented reality form.\n\nFurther innovative navigation functions such as precise visualizations of lane guidance are part of the optional MINI Connected Package.\n\nMINI Connected Store: AirConsole gaming, video streaming, Spotify and a constantly evolving range of apps.\n\nThe new MINI Connected Store combines with the optionally available MINI Connected package to provide access to a constantly evolving variety of practical and entertaining apps, including apps for gaming and music or video streaming. The availability of the apps varies from region to region in order to be able to offer customers the most tailored offer possible.\n\nFollowing its introduction in current BMW models, a form of in-car gaming unique in the automotive sector now also awaits customers of the new MINI family. For example, the driver and passengers can play casual games in the AirConsole App when the vehicle is stationary as a way of passing time while waiting for the high-voltage battery to recharge.\n\nSetting up the gaming experience with AirConsole is perfectly straightforward. All that players need is their smartphone, which acts as the controller, and the MINI Interaction Unit. Once the AirConsole App has been launched in the vehicle, the smartphone and car can be connected by scanning a QR code on the OLED display. Players can then get straight down to the action.\n\nThe AirConsole technology enables games to be made instantly available over the air and controlled using smartphones. This unique set-up means that multiple players – including passengers in the rear – can get involved in the in-car gaming fun during breaks in the journey. Generally speaking, it is possible to play alone or with all the other vehicle occupants, either as a team or in competition mode.\n\nThe games offered are casual games, so called because they are easy to pick up with intuitive control of gameplay. A range of racing, sport, general-knowledge quiz and music quiz games are available, along with simulation, strategy, jump-and-run and puzzle games, with titles including Go-Kart Go, Golazo, Music Guess and Overcooked. The portfolio of available games is constantly evolving.\n\nMusic streaming apps such as Spotify have been adapted for MINI Operating System 9 so that they integrate perfectly into the circular MINI Interaction Unit. This allows MINI customers to enjoy an intuitive and very visually appealing music streaming experience. The user’s Spotify account can be connected by simply scanning a QR code.\n\nThe MINI Connected services will be rolled out afresh in over 40 countries when the new MINI family is launched.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are likewise included as part of MINI Operating System 9 for connecting smartphones wirelessly.\n\nGreater flexibility and digital vehicle access with the MINI Digital Key Plus.\n\nThe new MINI family of models will offer customers another highlight feature in the form of the MINI Digital Key Plus. Once this has been set up on a compatible Apple, Google or Samsung device, drivers will be given a friendly welcome as soon as they approach the new MINIs thanks to their ultra-wideband technology. The welcome sequence is continued inside the car after the door has been opened and concludes with a personalised greeting courtesy of the MINI ID functionality. And this all happens without the driver even having to take their smartphone out of their pocket or bag. Keys can be passed on to friends or family easily and securely from the Apple or Google wallet using the native “share” function familiar from many apps.\n\nRemote Software Upgrades now standard for MINI too.\n\nAs a member of the BMW Group family, the MINI brand is benefiting from over five years of experience in over-the-air upgrades with BMW. The software architecture of the new MINI family employs the same software for Remote Software Upgrades that has benefited from ongoing development in BMW models since 2018 and ensures updates are carried out smoothly and securely. In this way, the new MINIs will receive free Remote Software Upgrades several times a year for quality improvements. Depending on the country, vehicle model, specification and vehicle status, the upgrades may also add new features or improvements to functions free of charge.\n\n*The availability of digital services varies by country, vehicle model and equipment. Selected functions can be rolled out via remote software upgrade after market launch."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Premiere in the automotive industry: MINI Interaction Unit is the first round OLED display with a refreshing user interface design +++ MINI Experience Modes use special designs, light projections and sound to create unique moments +++ Introduction of the MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant +++"}]}

The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated using the greeting “Hey MINI” or by pressing the push-to-talk button on the steering wheel. The voice-controlled interaction on the circular OLED display takes place in the form of an animation made up of graphical elements, typography and an avatar. For the visualisation, users can choose between “MINI” – a stylised representation of a MINI – and optionally “Spike”, a familiar figure already to many MINI fans.\n\nMany important functions, such as navigation, telephony, radio and temperature, can be controlled by voice command. The driver can make travel-related requests or wishes, such as “What’s the weather in... /at my destination?” and “Show me charging stations along the route”. If the customer expresses a wish, e.g. “I’m hungry” or “I’d like a coffee”, relevant options in the vicinity are displayed and route guidance to the desired destination can be started directly. Two microphones at the front of the headliner enable the system to automatically detect whether it is the driver or front passenger currently speaking.\n\nThe brand-typical character of the MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be experienced by customers through chit-chat, which will bring up MINI-specific answers, jokes and stories. Such as the question “Do you like me” or “Tell me a joke”.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant will already be based on the Alexa Custom Assistant’s AI technology stack at market launch, allowing it to engage in natural dialogue with the driver with a brand-defining voice. In many other markets, the new voice and other features also enabled by using the Alexa Custom Assistant will be introduced at a later stage over the air.\n\nMINI Navigation: Fresh map designs and cloud-based navigation with charging-optimised route planning.\n\nThe cloud-based navigation system represents a major improvement in performance over the preceding generation and offers exceptionally intuitive destination entry. It enables very fast and dynamic route calculation based on precise real-time traffic data transmitted at short intervals, which is then combined with forecasting models. When the navigation app is selected, the map takes up the entirety of the circular display. The colour scheme for the map graphics changes to match the selected MINI Experience Mode, while buildings can also be shown in 3D if desired.\n\nIn all-electric MINI models, as soon as the destination has been entered, a charging-optimised route will be calculated if the vehicle’s current range is not enough to reach the destination. Both the calculation algorithm and the speed of calculation for charging-optimised routes are subject to a process of constant improvement. Important information for the charging stops is displayed in the route overview, such as the estimated state of charge upon arrival, recommended charging time and target state of charge for the onward journey. Live data is processed during the journey, allowing new charging stations to be automatically added to the itinerary if any of the stations originally planned for charging stops no longer have availability. The driver is also offered alternative charging-optimised routes, where available. By default, the system is set to ensure that the vehicle reaches both the final destination and the charging stops with a charge level of at least 10 per cent. Drivers are able to adjust this spare charge setting if required.\n\nCharging is also made easier by the integration of the authorisation and start/stop functions for the charging process into the MINI App.\n\nThe optional Augmented View function enables exceptionally accurate navigational guidance. It provides a perfect complement to the navigation system’s instructions in crucial situations. For this, a live video stream from the driver’s perspective is shown on the MINI Interaction Unit and augmented by supplementary information that matches the context. At confusing junctions, for instance, an animated directional arrow is integrated into the video image to help the driver take the best turn-off for the planned route. In addition to this, information on applicable local parking regulations also appears in the live video stream in augmented reality form.\n\nFurther innovative navigation functions such as precise visualizations of lane guidance are part of the optional MINI Connected Package.\n\nMINI Connected Store: AirConsole gaming, video streaming, Spotify and a constantly evolving range of apps.\n\nThe new MINI Connected Store combines with the optionally available MINI Connected package to provide access to a constantly evolving variety of practical and entertaining apps, including apps for gaming and music or video streaming. The availability of the apps varies from region to region in order to be able to offer customers the most tailored offer possible.\n\nFollowing its introduction in current BMW models, a form of in-car gaming unique in the automotive sector now also awaits customers of the new MINI family. For example, the driver and passengers can play casual games in the AirConsole App when the vehicle is stationary as a way of passing time while waiting for the high-voltage battery to recharge.\n\nSetting up the gaming experience with AirConsole is perfectly straightforward. All that players need is their smartphone, which acts as the controller, and the MINI Interaction Unit. Once the AirConsole App has been launched in the vehicle, the smartphone and car can be connected by scanning a QR code on the OLED display. Players can then get straight down to the action.\n\nThe AirConsole technology enables games to be made instantly available over the air and controlled using smartphones. This unique set-up means that multiple players – including passengers in the rear – can get involved in the in-car gaming fun during breaks in the journey. Generally speaking, it is possible to play alone or with all the other vehicle occupants, either as a team or in competition mode.\n\nThe games offered are casual games, so called because they are easy to pick up with intuitive control of gameplay. A range of racing, sport, general-knowledge quiz and music quiz games are available, along with simulation, strategy, jump-and-run and puzzle games, with titles including Go-Kart Go, Golazo, Music Guess and Overcooked. The portfolio of available games is constantly evolving.\n\nMusic streaming apps such as Spotify have been adapted for MINI Operating System 9 so that they integrate perfectly into the circular MINI Interaction Unit. This allows MINI customers to enjoy an intuitive and very visually appealing music streaming experience. The user’s Spotify account can be connected by simply scanning a QR code.\n\nThe MINI Connected services will be rolled out afresh in over 40 countries when the new MINI family is launched.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are likewise included as part of MINI Operating System 9 for connecting smartphones wirelessly.\n\nGreater flexibility and digital vehicle access with the MINI Digital Key Plus.\n\nThe new MINI family of models will offer customers another highlight feature in the form of the MINI Digital Key Plus. Once this has been set up on a compatible Apple, Google or Samsung device, drivers will be given a friendly welcome as soon as they approach the new MINIs thanks to their ultra-wideband technology. The welcome sequence is continued inside the car after the door has been opened and concludes with a personalised greeting courtesy of the MINI ID functionality. And this all happens without the driver even having to take their smartphone out of their pocket or bag. Keys can be passed on to friends or family easily and securely from the Apple or Google wallet using the native “share” function familiar from many apps.\n\nRemote Software Upgrades now standard for MINI too.\n\nAs a member of the BMW Group family, the MINI brand is benefiting from over five years of experience in over-the-air upgrades with BMW. The software architecture of the new MINI family employs the same software for Remote Software Upgrades that has benefited from ongoing development in BMW models since 2018 and ensures updates are carried out smoothly and securely. In this way, the new MINIs will receive free Remote Software Upgrades several times a year for quality improvements. Depending on the country, vehicle model, specification and vehicle status, the upgrades may also add new features or improvements to functions free of charge.\n\n*The availability of digital services varies by country, vehicle model and equipment. Selected functions can be rolled out via remote software upgrade after market launch."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "New MINI family takes digital quantum leap with cutting-edge technology stack, round OLED display and MINI Operating System 9."}]}

History-rich British brand MINI is taking a quantum leap into the digital age with its new model family. At the heart of the action is the iconic central instrument – the MINI Interaction Unit. The round OLED display, with its 240 mm diameter and rich colours, blends perfectly into the interior of the new MINI family. Its positioning within the cabin allows it to be used comfortably by the driver and front passenger.\n\n“We are taking a massive leap into the digital world with the new MINI family and, in so doing, underscoring the charismatic heritage of the brand. The iconic central display in the new MINI family is round and will be filled with round content for the first time. I am convinced that the digital power of the new models will delight MINI customers around the world,” says Stefanie Wurst, Head of the MINI brand.\n\nFrank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development: “We are presenting our all-new MINI family with a unique technology package. It is based on the latest tech stack from BMW and brings a very specific MINI flavour to signature brand-defining functions such as the Experience Modes and the voice assistant. The result is a display of cutting-edge digital fireworks with a sharp eye for detail.”\n\nAn overview of the digital highlights of the new MINI family*:\n\nThe new MINI Operating System 9 – optimised interaction for touch and voice control.\n\nThe new “Charismatic Simplicity” design language is also reflected in the aesthetic of the user interface, which brings together functional and emotional elements. The reduced design uses all-new graphics to create an extremely modern look. Static and dynamic elements blend naturally into the circular form of the OLED display, following a clear structure. Micro-animations enhance the already extremely intuitive interaction between the driver and central instrument and underscore the digital character of the new MINI family.\n\nMINI Operating System 9 is an in-house development by the BMW Group and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. Operation is intuitive and follows the standards familiar from consumer electronics.\n\nAt the centre of the screen is the start menu, where personalised content can be selected and launched by swiping to the side. In the lower section of the screen is the fixed status bar containing the menu items “Navigation”, “Media”, “Telephony”, “All Apps” and, depending on the situation, “Home”, which can be selected directly. Swiping up from the lower edge of the screen reveals a tool belt, a process customers will be familiar with from many consumer electronics devices. Favourite functions can be stored here and called up again rapidly, i. e. navigation destinations and radio stations. The tool belt can also be activated via the star button on the multifunction steering wheel. The upper screen area is reserved for driving-relevant content such as the vehicle speed and important information on the vehicle status. The optional Head-up display shows the most important information for the driver in their field of view.\n\nThe temperature for the driver and front passenger is permanently displayed on the left- and right-hand edge of the screen. The climate control settings are integrated into the MINI Interaction Unit and can always be adjusted on the top layer by touch or voice command.\n\nDepending on the Experience Mode selected, a single tap on the speed display transforms the entire MINI Interaction Unit into a MINI-typical speedometer.\n\nMINI Experience Modes for intensely MINI moments.\n\nThe emotional connection between the new MINIs and their drivers steps up another degree in intensity with the MINI Experience Modes. Standard specification includes the Core, Green and Go-Kart Modes, each of which has its own specific user interface design. The Experience Modes can optionally be taken to the next level by the additional, coordinated use of light and sound. Drivers can immerse themselves in up to eight different worlds in the interior of the new-generation MINIs thanks to the MINI Experience Modes, with a distinctive jingle for each Mode indicating it has been activated.\n\nThe MINI Interaction Unit displays different designs and content according to the mode selected. A standout feature of the interior experience is a fresh interpretation of the signature MINI interior lighting. An optional projector on the back of the OLED display bathes the dashboard in coordinated colour worlds and patterns. The interplay of the projection, ambient lighting and MINI Interaction Unit creates a unique, immersive experience that extends into the door trim.\n\nA particular highlight is Personal Mode, which breaks new ground in terms of personalisation and adjustability. It allows customers to turn their own pictures from their smartphone gallery into the background for the MINI Interaction Unit using the MINI App. The ambient lighting is set automatically in a colour that matches the picture selected.\n\nThe colour design in the optional Head-up display likewise adapts to the MINI Experience Mode selected. This also contributes to an emotionally engaging and consistent digital user experience.\n\nUnmistakable sound for all-electric MINI models.\n\nThe brand-typical soundscapes of the new MINI family are also part of the digital user experience. The spread of options includes all-new driving sounds in the interior, an unmistakable MINI brand sound to confirm the car’s identity from the outside, jingles for the new MINI Experience Modes and 30 new sound signals with information and warning functions.\n\nThe new sounds bring extra emotional appeal to the interior of the MINI and shape its acoustic statement to the world beyond. They provide the cars with a distinctive, MINI-typical identifying feature on an acoustic level. The first customers to experience the new sounds will be drivers of the new MINI Cooper Electric.\n\nThe new MINI sound DNA is based on the fundamental values of the brand and embodies a positive, charismatic aura. The MINI Experience Modes provide the stage on which the all-new soundscapes are performed. Familiar MINI sounds conveying information while also sparking emotions are generated using analogue instruments, digital technology and artificial intelligence. These MINI Experience Modes deliver immersive driving experiences.\n\nMINI Intelligent Personal Assistant – visually accompanied by “MINI” or “Spike”.\n\nThis is the first time a full-capability voice assistant will be included in models from the MINI brand. The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated using the greeting “Hey MINI” or by pressing the push-to-talk button on the steering wheel.

For the visualisation, users can choose between “MINI” – a stylised representation of a MINI – and optionally “Spike”, a familiar figure already to many MINI fans.\n\nMany important functions, such as navigation, telephony, radio and temperature, can be controlled by voice command. The driver can make travel-related requests or wishes, such as “What’s the weather in... /at my destination?” and “Show me charging stations along the route”. If the customer expresses a wish, e.g. “I’m hungry” or “I’d like a coffee”, relevant options in the vicinity are displayed and route guidance to the desired destination can be started directly.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at summarizing BMW news articles. Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\n- Check against delivery –\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nSLIDE 2: BMW Group Quarterly Statement to 31 March 2024\n\nThe BMW Group had a successful start into 2024.\n\nBoth sales and earnings for the first quarter were in line with our expectations. This results from the focused implementation of our strategic priorities.\n\nAt the BMW Group, we have strong brands and attractive products, which create ongoing high demand and a profitable operational business.\n\nSLIDE 3: Highlights of BMW Group Performance in Q1 2024\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered just under 595,000 vehicles to customers. This is a slight increase of 1.1 percent over the same period of last year.\n\nOur all-electric vehicles, in particular, made an important contribution, with growth of 27.9 percent.\n\nIf we look at the BMW brand alone, that number was 40.6 percent.\n\nAt the same time, sales of models in the upper premium segment also recorded significant double-digit growth of more than 21 percent.\n\nThe Group EBT margin for the first quarter came in at 11.4 percent, which is above our strategic target of 10 percent.\n\nThe EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment was 8.8 percent. This falls clearly within our target corridor of 8 to 10 percent.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis quarter confirms once again that the BMW Group's operating business consistently delivers strong results.\n\nWe have a clearly defined long-term plan. And we have significant flexibility in our systems and processes. This allows us to adapt quickly to developments and take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nOn this basis, we expect to operate at a consistent level throughout 2024.\n\nSLIDE 4: BMW Group in Q1\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the first quarter in more detail.\n\nI’ll start with a brief overview at Group level.\n\nBMW Group revenues were on par with the previous year.\n\nGroup earnings before tax totalled around 4.2 billion euros, resulting in a Group EBT margin of 11.4 percent.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nAnd now more details on how the Automotive Segment performed across key metrics.\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered 595,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers.\n\nThe BMW brand reported growth of 2.5 percent.\n\nDue to the upcoming model changeovers MINI sales were down 9.4 percent from the previous year. The New MINI Family, comprising the Countryman*, the Cooper* and the Aceman*, will boost MINI sales – particularly in the second half of the year.\n\nThis sales development is also reflected in segment revenues. Adjusted for currency translation effects, revenues saw a slight increase of 1.5 percent.\n\nBoth the higher sales volume and positive product mix effects from the upper price segment and BEV contributed to the increase in revenues in Q1 2024.\n\nThis is expected to provide a tailwind for revenues also in the remainder of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, prices across the product portfolio are expected to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nThe electrification of our product line-up continued to generate substantial sales momentum in the most recent quarter.\n\nAlmost 83,000 fully-electric vehicles were sold – or 13.9 percent of our total sales.\n\nTaken together, BEV and plug-in hybrids accounted for about 21 percent of total sales in the first quarter.\n\nEBIT for the period from January to March was 2.7 billion euros, with an EBIT margin of 8.8 percent.\n\nThis means that the first quarter of 2024 is in line with the consistent trend in profitability since the beginning of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 was exceptional, as the effects of inflation were not yet fully reflected in the operating result.\n\nI will provide more details on the Q1 year-on-year development with the EBIT bridge.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q1\n\nChanges in commodity prices accounted for a positive impact of around 200 million euros. Currency effects remained neutral.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model-mix and pricing effects is about 300 million euros lower than for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIncrease in volumes made a slight positive contribution.\n\nThe double-digit growth by models in the upper price segment almost entirely compensated the effect from the higher BEV share.\n\nStarting with the second quarter of 2023, we began to see increased competition due to better availability of vehicles in the market. This led to a gradual softening of the global price environment for new and used cars, which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect the net effect from volume, mix and pricing to be slightly positive, as planned.\n\nWe expect additional momentum from models like the new BMW 5 Series, which is currently ramping up in markets across the globe. In China, it launched after the Lunar New Year holiday and has therefore only been in showrooms for a few weeks.\n\nFull availability of the BMW 7 Series will also have a positive effect.\n\nMoving on, we come to research and development expenses – which were 200 million euros higher than in the prior-year first quarter.\n\nBased on Group R&D expenditure, the R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code came in at 5.4 percent.\n\nOur R&D activities remain focused on the electrification and digitalisation of our entire vehicle fleet. We are constantly developing attractive new models, like the NEUE KLASSE or the next generation of the BMW X5.\n\nSales and administrative costs were 100 million euros higher than the previous year. This is largely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe headwind of 700 million euros from Other Cost Changes essentially results from two areas.\n\nThe first is manufacturing costs.\n\nSales margins in the first quarter of 2023 still benefitted from a lower level of purchasing prices in 2022.\n\nThis led to a positive EBIT effect in Q1 2023 as inventories with lower manufacturing costs were sold.\n\nStarting in Q2 2023, we saw an elevation in costs that has carried through into Q1 2024.\n\nAnother reason for the difference in other cost changes is income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles.\n\nAs expected, income was lower than in the first quarter of 2023, yet remains positive.\n\nThe normalisation we have been seeing in the used car market over the past twelve to fifteen months has gradually continued.\n\nSLIDE 7: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q1\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled about 1.3 billion euros in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe difference to the first quarter of 2023 mainly results from the lower EBT.\n\nInventory levels rose during the first quarter, in line with planning. This contributed to the change in working capital, which amounts to 1.2 billion euros.\n\nThe increase in stock will ensure that we can service the expected customer demand.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation also reduced free cash flow by 200 million euros.\n\nCapital expenditure for January to March totalled around 1.3 billion euros. This was mainly allocated to new models and structures, with a clear focus on electrification and digitalisation as well as automated driving systems.\n\nThe capex ratio for the year to the end of March was 3.6 percent.\n\nChanges in provisions and in the position other, such as tax payments, had no net impact on free cash flow.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, investments totalling 2.3 billion euros were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, the Automotive segment generated 1.3 billion euros in free cashflow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cashflow above 6 billion euros in the Automotive segment, despite the planned peak investments in R&D and capex in 2024.\n\nThe strong underlying free cashflow generation supports our ongoing and consistent shareholder return.\n\nAs part of the share buyback program BMW AG has acquired shares equivalent to 5.03 percent of the share capital in place on March 31st.\n\nThe second tranche of the second program with a volume of 500 million euros is currently in progress and will be completed no later than June 28th.\n\nCurrently we see no reason not to continue with tranche three immediately after conclusion of tranche two.\n\nSLIDE 8: Financial Services Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the positive trend in new business from the second half of 2023 continued through the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe number of new contracts concluded with retail customers increased significantly by 21.5 percent year-on-year to reach 422,000 contracts. Financing for both new and used vehicles contributed to this growth.\n\nIn line with this, the volume of new business grew by 22.1 percent to just over 15.6 billion euros.\n\nSegment earnings for the first quarter amounted to 730 million euros – a decrease of 215 million from the previous year.\n\nThis can be attributed both to higher credit risk provisioning and the normalisation of income from the resale of lease returns.\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained at a low rate of 0.21 percent.\n\nSLIDE 9: Motorcycles Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, first-quarter deliveries decreased slightly by 3.1 percent year-on-year.\n\nEBIT for the year to the end of March totalled 106 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 12.2 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAfter a successful first quarter, we expect the solid business performance to continue throughout the year 2024.\n\nTherefore, our guidance for key performance indicators remains unchanged.\n\nThis is based on the assumption that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions do not deteriorate.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are projected to decrease slightly.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment, we are planning for slight year-on-year sales growth – with the percentage of all-electric vehicles set to increase significantly.\n\nWe expect to see an EBIT margin of between 8 and 10 percent and a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) of between 15 and 20 percent.\n\nSales should be slightly higher in the Motorcycles Segment, too. The segment's EBIT margin should come in at between 8 and 10 percent and Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) should be between 21 and 26 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, we are targeting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 14 to 17 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 11: BMW Group with Consistent Performance\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group combines a robust financial performance in its current business with a long-term perspective for the future.\n\nWe have a range of highly attractive products in the market and we are continuously developing new models that will set the standard for driving experience, digitalisation and connectivity.\n\nAs planned for and previously announced, our research and development spending, and our capital expenditure, will respectively peak in 2024.\n\nWe expect our R&D ratio for the full year to be above 5 percent, and the capex ratio above 6 percent.\n\nOur underlying profitability allows us to finance these investments in the future and at the same time yield attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nWe continue to steer the company in line with our strategic priorities.

This results from the focused implementation of our strategic priorities.\n\nAt the BMW Group, we have strong brands and attractive products, which create ongoing high demand and a profitable operational business.\n\nSLIDE 3: Highlights of BMW Group Performance in Q1 2024\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered just under 595,000 vehicles to customers. This is a slight increase of 1.1 percent over the same period of last year.\n\nOur all-electric vehicles, in particular, made an important contribution, with growth of 27.9 percent.\n\nIf we look at the BMW brand alone, that number was 40.6 percent.\n\nAt the same time, sales of models in the upper premium segment also recorded significant double-digit growth of more than 21 percent.\n\nThe Group EBT margin for the first quarter came in at 11.4 percent, which is above our strategic target of 10 percent.\n\nThe EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment was 8.8 percent. This falls clearly within our target corridor of 8 to 10 percent.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis quarter confirms once again that the BMW Group's operating business consistently delivers strong results.\n\nWe have a clearly defined long-term plan. And we have significant flexibility in our systems and processes. This allows us to adapt quickly to developments and take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nOn this basis, we expect to operate at a consistent level throughout 2024.\n\nSLIDE 4: BMW Group in Q1\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the first quarter in more detail.\n\nI’ll start with a brief overview at Group level.\n\nBMW Group revenues were on par with the previous year.\n\nGroup earnings before tax totalled around 4.2 billion euros, resulting in a Group EBT margin of 11.4 percent.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nAnd now more details on how the Automotive Segment performed across key metrics.\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered 595,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers.\n\nThe BMW brand reported growth of 2.5 percent.\n\nDue to the upcoming model changeovers MINI sales were down 9.4 percent from the previous year. The New MINI Family, comprising the Countryman*, the Cooper* and the Aceman*, will boost MINI sales – particularly in the second half of the year.\n\nThis sales development is also reflected in segment revenues. Adjusted for currency translation effects, revenues saw a slight increase of 1.5 percent.\n\nBoth the higher sales volume and positive product mix effects from the upper price segment and BEV contributed to the increase in revenues in Q1 2024.\n\nThis is expected to provide a tailwind for revenues also in the remainder of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, prices across the product portfolio are expected to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nThe electrification of our product line-up continued to generate substantial sales momentum in the most recent quarter.\n\nAlmost 83,000 fully-electric vehicles were sold – or 13.9 percent of our total sales.\n\nTaken together, BEV and plug-in hybrids accounted for about 21 percent of total sales in the first quarter.\n\nEBIT for the period from January to March was 2.7 billion euros, with an EBIT margin of 8.8 percent.\n\nThis means that the first quarter of 2024 is in line with the consistent trend in profitability since the beginning of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 was exceptional, as the effects of inflation were not yet fully reflected in the operating result.\n\nI will provide more details on the Q1 year-on-year development with the EBIT bridge.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q1\n\nChanges in commodity prices accounted for a positive impact of around 200 million euros. Currency effects remained neutral.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model-mix and pricing effects is about 300 million euros lower than for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIncrease in volumes made a slight positive contribution.\n\nThe double-digit growth by models in the upper price segment almost entirely compensated the effect from the higher BEV share.\n\nStarting with the second quarter of 2023, we began to see increased competition due to better availability of vehicles in the market. This led to a gradual softening of the global price environment for new and used cars, which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect the net effect from volume, mix and pricing to be slightly positive, as planned.\n\nWe expect additional momentum from models like the new BMW 5 Series, which is currently ramping up in markets across the globe. In China, it launched after the Lunar New Year holiday and has therefore only been in showrooms for a few weeks.\n\nFull availability of the BMW 7 Series will also have a positive effect.\n\nMoving on, we come to research and development expenses – which were 200 million euros higher than in the prior-year first quarter.\n\nBased on Group R&D expenditure, the R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code came in at 5.4 percent.\n\nOur R&D activities remain focused on the electrification and digitalisation of our entire vehicle fleet. We are constantly developing attractive new models, like the NEUE KLASSE or the next generation of the BMW X5.\n\nSales and administrative costs were 100 million euros higher than the previous year. This is largely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe headwind of 700 million euros from Other Cost Changes essentially results from two areas.\n\nThe first is manufacturing costs.\n\nSales margins in the first quarter of 2023 still benefitted from a lower level of purchasing prices in 2022.\n\nThis led to a positive EBIT effect in Q1 2023 as inventories with lower manufacturing costs were sold.\n\nStarting in Q2 2023, we saw an elevation in costs that has carried through into Q1 2024.\n\nAnother reason for the difference in other cost changes is income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles.\n\nAs expected, income was lower than in the first quarter of 2023, yet remains positive.\n\nThe normalisation we have been seeing in the used car market over the past twelve to fifteen months has gradually continued.\n\nSLIDE 7: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q1\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled about 1.3 billion euros in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe difference to the first quarter of 2023 mainly results from the lower EBT.\n\nInventory levels rose during the first quarter, in line with planning. This contributed to the change in working capital, which amounts to 1.2 billion euros.\n\nThe increase in stock will ensure that we can service the expected customer demand.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation also reduced free cash flow by 200 million euros.\n\nCapital expenditure for January to March totalled around 1.3 billion euros. This was mainly allocated to new models and structures, with a clear focus on electrification and digitalisation as well as automated driving systems.\n\nThe capex ratio for the year to the end of March was 3.6 percent.\n\nChanges in provisions and in the position other, such as tax payments, had no net impact on free cash flow.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, investments totalling 2.3 billion euros were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, the Automotive segment generated 1.3 billion euros in free cashflow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cashflow above 6 billion euros in the Automotive segment, despite the planned peak investments in R&D and capex in 2024.\n\nThe strong underlying free cashflow generation supports our ongoing and consistent shareholder return.\n\nAs part of the share buyback program BMW AG has acquired shares equivalent to 5.03 percent of the share capital in place on March 31st.\n\nThe second tranche of the second program with a volume of 500 million euros is currently in progress and will be completed no later than June 28th.\n\nCurrently we see no reason not to continue with tranche three immediately after conclusion of tranche two.\n\nSLIDE 8: Financial Services Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the positive trend in new business from the second half of 2023 continued through the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe number of new contracts concluded with retail customers increased significantly by 21.5 percent year-on-year to reach 422,000 contracts. Financing for both new and used vehicles contributed to this growth.\n\nIn line with this, the volume of new business grew by 22.1 percent to just over 15.6 billion euros.\n\nSegment earnings for the first quarter amounted to 730 million euros – a decrease of 215 million from the previous year.\n\nThis can be attributed both to higher credit risk provisioning and the normalisation of income from the resale of lease returns.\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained at a low rate of 0.21 percent.\n\nSLIDE 9: Motorcycles Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, first-quarter deliveries decreased slightly by 3.1 percent year-on-year.\n\nEBIT for the year to the end of March totalled 106 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 12.2 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAfter a successful first quarter, we expect the solid business performance to continue throughout the year 2024.\n\nTherefore, our guidance for key performance indicators remains unchanged.\n\nThis is based on the assumption that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions do not deteriorate.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are projected to decrease slightly.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment, we are planning for slight year-on-year sales growth – with the percentage of all-electric vehicles set to increase significantly.\n\nWe expect to see an EBIT margin of between 8 and 10 percent and a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) of between 15 and 20 percent.\n\nSales should be slightly higher in the Motorcycles Segment, too. The segment's EBIT margin should come in at between 8 and 10 percent and Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) should be between 21 and 26 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, we are targeting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 14 to 17 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 11: BMW Group with Consistent Performance\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group combines a robust financial performance in its current business with a long-term perspective for the future.\n\nWe have a range of highly attractive products in the market and we are continuously developing new models that will set the standard for driving experience, digitalisation and connectivity.\n\nAs planned for and previously announced, our research and development spending, and our capital expenditure, will respectively peak in 2024.\n\nWe expect our R&D ratio for the full year to be above 5 percent, and the capex ratio above 6 percent.\n\nOur underlying profitability allows us to finance these investments in the future and at the same time yield attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nWe continue to steer the company in line with our strategic priorities.

This allows us to adapt quickly to developments and take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nOn this basis, we expect to operate at a consistent level throughout 2024.\n\nSLIDE 4: BMW Group in Q1\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the first quarter in more detail.\n\nI’ll start with a brief overview at Group level.\n\nBMW Group revenues were on par with the previous year.\n\nGroup earnings before tax totalled around 4.2 billion euros, resulting in a Group EBT margin of 11.4 percent.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nAnd now more details on how the Automotive Segment performed across key metrics.\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered 595,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers.\n\nThe BMW brand reported growth of 2.5 percent.\n\nDue to the upcoming model changeovers MINI sales were down 9.4 percent from the previous year. The New MINI Family, comprising the Countryman*, the Cooper* and the Aceman*, will boost MINI sales – particularly in the second half of the year.\n\nThis sales development is also reflected in segment revenues. Adjusted for currency translation effects, revenues saw a slight increase of 1.5 percent.\n\nBoth the higher sales volume and positive product mix effects from the upper price segment and BEV contributed to the increase in revenues in Q1 2024.\n\nThis is expected to provide a tailwind for revenues also in the remainder of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, prices across the product portfolio are expected to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nThe electrification of our product line-up continued to generate substantial sales momentum in the most recent quarter.\n\nAlmost 83,000 fully-electric vehicles were sold – or 13.9 percent of our total sales.\n\nTaken together, BEV and plug-in hybrids accounted for about 21 percent of total sales in the first quarter.\n\nEBIT for the period from January to March was 2.7 billion euros, with an EBIT margin of 8.8 percent.\n\nThis means that the first quarter of 2024 is in line with the consistent trend in profitability since the beginning of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 was exceptional, as the effects of inflation were not yet fully reflected in the operating result.\n\nI will provide more details on the Q1 year-on-year development with the EBIT bridge.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q1\n\nChanges in commodity prices accounted for a positive impact of around 200 million euros. Currency effects remained neutral.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model-mix and pricing effects is about 300 million euros lower than for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIncrease in volumes made a slight positive contribution.\n\nThe double-digit growth by models in the upper price segment almost entirely compensated the effect from the higher BEV share.\n\nStarting with the second quarter of 2023, we began to see increased competition due to better availability of vehicles in the market. This led to a gradual softening of the global price environment for new and used cars, which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect the net effect from volume, mix and pricing to be slightly positive, as planned.\n\nWe expect additional momentum from models like the new BMW 5 Series, which is currently ramping up in markets across the globe. In China, it launched after the Lunar New Year holiday and has therefore only been in showrooms for a few weeks.\n\nFull availability of the BMW 7 Series will also have a positive effect.\n\nMoving on, we come to research and development expenses – which were 200 million euros higher than in the prior-year first quarter.\n\nBased on Group R&D expenditure, the R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code came in at 5.4 percent.\n\nOur R&D activities remain focused on the electrification and digitalisation of our entire vehicle fleet. We are constantly developing attractive new models, like the NEUE KLASSE or the next generation of the BMW X5.\n\nSales and administrative costs were 100 million euros higher than the previous year. This is largely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe headwind of 700 million euros from Other Cost Changes essentially results from two areas.\n\nThe first is manufacturing costs.\n\nSales margins in the first quarter of 2023 still benefitted from a lower level of purchasing prices in 2022.\n\nThis led to a positive EBIT effect in Q1 2023 as inventories with lower manufacturing costs were sold.\n\nStarting in Q2 2023, we saw an elevation in costs that has carried through into Q1 2024.\n\nAnother reason for the difference in other cost changes is income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles.\n\nAs expected, income was lower than in the first quarter of 2023, yet remains positive.\n\nThe normalisation we have been seeing in the used car market over the past twelve to fifteen months has gradually continued.\n\nSLIDE 7: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q1\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled about 1.3 billion euros in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe difference to the first quarter of 2023 mainly results from the lower EBT.\n\nInventory levels rose during the first quarter, in line with planning. This contributed to the change in working capital, which amounts to 1.2 billion euros.\n\nThe increase in stock will ensure that we can service the expected customer demand.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation also reduced free cash flow by 200 million euros.\n\nCapital expenditure for January to March totalled around 1.3 billion euros. This was mainly allocated to new models and structures, with a clear focus on electrification and digitalisation as well as automated driving systems.\n\nThe capex ratio for the year to the end of March was 3.6 percent.\n\nChanges in provisions and in the position other, such as tax payments, had no net impact on free cash flow.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, investments totalling 2.3 billion euros were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, the Automotive segment generated 1.3 billion euros in free cashflow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cashflow above 6 billion euros in the Automotive segment, despite the planned peak investments in R&D and capex in 2024.\n\nThe strong underlying free cashflow generation supports our ongoing and consistent shareholder return.\n\nAs part of the share buyback program BMW AG has acquired shares equivalent to 5.03 percent of the share capital in place on March 31st.\n\nThe second tranche of the second program with a volume of 500 million euros is currently in progress and will be completed no later than June 28th.\n\nCurrently we see no reason not to continue with tranche three immediately after conclusion of tranche two.\n\nSLIDE 8: Financial Services Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the positive trend in new business from the second half of 2023 continued through the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe number of new contracts concluded with retail customers increased significantly by 21.5 percent year-on-year to reach 422,000 contracts. Financing for both new and used vehicles contributed to this growth.\n\nIn line with this, the volume of new business grew by 22.1 percent to just over 15.6 billion euros.\n\nSegment earnings for the first quarter amounted to 730 million euros – a decrease of 215 million from the previous year.\n\nThis can be attributed both to higher credit risk provisioning and the normalisation of income from the resale of lease returns.\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained at a low rate of 0.21 percent.\n\nSLIDE 9: Motorcycles Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, first-quarter deliveries decreased slightly by 3.1 percent year-on-year.\n\nEBIT for the year to the end of March totalled 106 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 12.2 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAfter a successful first quarter, we expect the solid business performance to continue throughout the year 2024.\n\nTherefore, our guidance for key performance indicators remains unchanged.\n\nThis is based on the assumption that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions do not deteriorate.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are projected to decrease slightly.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment, we are planning for slight year-on-year sales growth – with the percentage of all-electric vehicles set to increase significantly.\n\nWe expect to see an EBIT margin of between 8 and 10 percent and a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) of between 15 and 20 percent.\n\nSales should be slightly higher in the Motorcycles Segment, too. The segment's EBIT margin should come in at between 8 and 10 percent and Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) should be between 21 and 26 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, we are targeting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 14 to 17 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 11: BMW Group with Consistent Performance\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group combines a robust financial performance in its current business with a long-term perspective for the future.\n\nWe have a range of highly attractive products in the market and we are continuously developing new models that will set the standard for driving experience, digitalisation and connectivity.\n\nAs planned for and previously announced, our research and development spending, and our capital expenditure, will respectively peak in 2024.\n\nWe expect our R&D ratio for the full year to be above 5 percent, and the capex ratio above 6 percent.\n\nOur underlying profitability allows us to finance these investments in the future and at the same time yield attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nWe continue to steer the company in line with our strategic priorities. And we deliver what we promise.\n\nOur flexibility allows us to quickly adapt to market fluctuations and to meet customer demand across the globe.\n\nThis ensures that we capitalize on market developments and deliver strong results through consistent execution.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Countryman: energy consumption combined in l/100km: 6,2; CO2 emissions combined g/km: 141; CO2 class E MINI Cooper 3-Türer: energy consumption combined in l/100km: 6,4; CO2 emissions combined g/km: 144; CO2 class E MINI Aceman E: electricity consumption combined: 14,7 – 14,1 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 298 - 310"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

T he season finale of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS was not for the faint-hearted. In the 6-hour Endurance Cup race in Jeddah (KSA), BMW M Team WRT narrowly missed the podium with both BMW M4 GT3s. The #32 car crossed the finish line under the floodlights in fourth place, closely followed by the #46 in fifth. In the team championship standings, BMW M Team WRT is crowned champion. In the Bronze Cup, the team secured a podium finish with the #30 BMW M4 GT3, taking second place after strong comebacks from a challenging qualifying session.\n\nSheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Charles Weerts (BEL) had to fight their way forward from 24th on the grid in the #32 BMW M4 GT3. Thanks to a perfect strategy, the car was running in third place with 20 minutes remaining. However, the finish was highly turbulent following a restart after a safety car period. In the battle for the podium, debris got in front of the radiator, and Vanthoor ultimately dropped back. In the drivers’ standings of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Vanthoor and Weerts finished the season in second place, just 2.5 points behind the leaders.\n\nIn the #46 BMW M4 GT3, Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) started from 23rd and, through clever strategy by BMW M Team WRT, even briefly took the lead. From there, they were in the mix for podium contention, ultimately finishing in fifth place after the dramatic closing stages.\n\nThe ROWE Racing #998 BMW M4 GT3, which had qualified best among the BMWs with 11th place, was also performing well in the race. The trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Max Hesse (GER), and Dan Harper (GBR) were in a strong position until Harper was hit heavily in the rear during a full course yellow period. Although Harper managed to bring the BMW M4 GT3, featuring the livery of BMW M Motorsport partner MultiBank Group, back to the pits, a damage in the chassis area meant a bitter, premature end to their race.\n\nIn the drivers’ standings of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Vanthoor and Weerts finished the combined sprint and endurance season in second place, just 2.5 points behind the leaders. The team title decision remains pending as the results of a previous race have yet to be officially confirmed.\n\nIn the Bronze Cup, Jens Klingmann (GER), Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), and Sam De Haan (GBR) also staged a comeback in the #30 BMW M4 GT3, starting from eighth place and finishing second on the podium after six thrilling hours of racing. Unfortunately, the Paradine Competition #991 BMW M4 GT3 from Century Motorsport retired after just one hour due to a technical defect while being driven by Toby Sowery (GBR). Sowery and his teammates Jake Dennis and Darren Leung (both GBR) had qualified third in the Bronze category. Leung, Harper and Paradine Competition had previously won the drivers’ and team titles in the Bronze category at the Barcelona (ESP) sprint finale.\n\nSuccesses in the GT4 European Series.\n\nAt the GT4 European Series finale, also held in Jeddah over the weekend, BMW M Motorsport teams again had reasons to celebrate. Ricardo van der Ende (NED) and Benjamin Lessenes (BEL) claimed second place overall and in the Silver class in the second of two races with the #17 BMW M4 GT4 from L’Espace Bienvenue. They finished third in the final Silver class championship standings. Pedro Carvalho Ebrahim (BRA) from Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport earned the “Rookie of the Year” award. In the Am category, Antoni de Barn and Jean-Mathieu Leandri (both FRA) drove the #317 BMW M4 GT4 from Team Chazel Technologie Course to second place in their class in both races.\n\nQuotes after the Jeddah season finale:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “We all expected a spectacular season finale in Jeddah – and that’s exactly what we got. Congratulations to the BMW M Team WRT, which stands at the top of the overall team standings in the GT World Challenge Europe after a long season. In practice and qualifying, our BMW M4 GT3s struggled a bit on the tight street circuit, but once again, the race pace was very strong. Add to that the right strategic decisions in a race with multiple yellow and safety car periods. A podium in the Pro class would have been well deserved, but positions were reshuffled in the final phase. With car number 32, we were on a secure podium position and thus on track for the title, but then, unfortunately, debris got in front of the radiator, and we lost positions in the first laps after the safety car. I am confident the #998 from ROWE Racing would have also been in contention for the podium if it hadn’t been forced to retire early through no fault of its own. That is racing, but I think everyone can be proud of what they did. Congratulations to the crew of the #30 car for another Bronze podium finish after their fantastic overall win at Monza. I want to thank all the teams and drivers for their hard work and dedication this season. I also want to congratulate our customer racing teams in the GT4 European Series, who rose to the challenge of Jeddah magnificently.”\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal BMW M Team WRT: “As we say, a hard one to swallow. The last 20 minutes were a bit crazy. We were fighting for P2, giving us the Overall Drivers and Endurance Teams championships, on top of the Overall Teams’ title. At the end, due to debris we got in the radiator, we had to slow down. We lost three positions, and two titles. Anyway, we finish second in the Overall Drivers championship, 2.5 points behind Maro Engel and Lucas Auer. Congrats to them. In the end, we are still Overall (Sprint and Endurance) Teams champions, which is a great reward! It was a tough season but a good one. We had some ups and downs, but we will remember the exceptional win of car 30 in Monza. It was a special and incredible one with a 1-2 finish. This is what I will remember from the Endurance Championship!”\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf, Team Principal ROWE Racing: “It’s somewhat symbolic that this season ends like this. It started perfectly with the Le Castellet victory, but after that, we had a lot of bad luck with retirements, tyre failures, unavoidable contacts, and accidents. The performance was always there, and we could fight at the front, but you can’t control such things. It’s tough for the team; you feel powerless. Even though you’re doing a good job, the results are missing. The team had to endure a lot, but the fact that we still managed to deliver every time and once again fought for the title until the very last race of the season shows how strong our team is.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 4th place): “It has been my first time in Jeddah as for everybody here. The weekend was quite eventful weekend. We were lacking a bit of pace during the different practice sessions and in qualifying. We made a good step for the race, we had a great car. It was nice to drive! We had good fights and we had a shot at the podium. It’s a shame that we lost it in the last moments but that’s part of racing. Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes not. Overall we can say it was a good race where we showed again the potential of the BMW M4 GT3 and where we gained 20 positions. It’s a good way to finish the season even though I believe a podium would have been deserved.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 5th place): “It was a very good race for us because we started from P23 and were able to arrive in the top five at the end and we were fighting for the podium until the last lap. I think that we worked very well this weekend and we were able to improve. From the season in general, I expected more, especially as our line-up is great with Raffaele Marciello and Maxime Martin. I think that often we had a good speed but we were a bit unlucky. We had good races, we won, we got some podiums. We were not able to achieve a podium in an endurance race, that was the target. But in the end, it was a good season.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#30 OQ by Oman Racing BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 2nd place Bronze Cup): “I am happy that we have brought the car home in P2. It is very difficult to drive on this track because the walls don’t leave margin for any errors. This was a huge challenge. We got a penalty for track limits which is very critical on this track but we managed to come back from that. That was the key to this race and we finished in the highest position we could aim for. I think that P1 was never in our reach. The winners were just too strong tonight so we maximised our result. It was good fun and we enjoy being on the podium on such a difficult street circuit. In this season, we had ups and downs. The longer the season went, the better we got. The highlight was the overall victory at Monza that no one can take from us and which was the first time in history. It’s been good season in a highly contested GT3 championship, so I am still very proud. Thanks to the whole team for the support and effort. It has been a pure joy.”\n\nDan Harper (#998 BMW M4 GT3, ROWE Racing, DNF): “After a difficult weekend up until qualifying we were happy with P11 in qualifying. Augusto did a great job in the beginning because it is obviously so tight here. A lot can happen. He stayed clean and gained a couple of positions. It was perfect. Unfortunately then when I got in the car was a full course yellow very quickly. I was just settling into the rhythm. Coming from turn three into four, the car in front of me braked for the countdown so I also braked at the same point as him. But then from behind I got hit. I have been never hit so hard in my life actually, so it kind of hurt initially but thankfully I’m okay now. But the car couldn’t continue, the suspension was broken. It’s just a shame for everybody. Obviously it’s a long way to come here. And it’s a cool race so it’s a shame that it ended early for us.”\n\nToby Sowery (#991 BMW M4 GT3, Paradine Competition by Century Motorsport, DNF): “I think it’s a difficult track for everyone and a lot of drivers had never driven here before so it was a learning curve. All in all, the BMWs had a strong package here at the weekend and it’s proven well in the race. I think one lap was in favour of other cars but in race pace, we have been the car to beat. It’s a shame because we were looking super strong. But that’s racing.”\n\nNote to editors: Footage and interviews from the 6 Hours of Jeddah of the Fanatec GT World Challenge powered by AWS and the season finale of the GT4 European Series are available for editorial use at the following link:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The season finale of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS was not for the faint-hearted.

And it’s a cool race so it’s a shame that it ended early for us.”\n\nToby Sowery (#991 BMW M4 GT3, Paradine Competition by Century Motorsport, DNF): “I think it’s a difficult track for everyone and a lot of drivers had never driven here before so it was a learning curve. All in all, the BMWs had a strong package here at the weekend and it’s proven well in the race. I think one lap was in favour of other cars but in race pace, we have been the car to beat.

T he season finale of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS was not for the faint-hearted. In the 6-hour Endurance Cup race in Jeddah (KSA), BMW M Team WRT narrowly missed the podium with both BMW M4 GT3s. The #32 car crossed the finish line under the floodlights in fourth place, closely followed by the #46 in fifth. In the team championship standings, BMW M Team WRT is crowned champion. In the Bronze Cup, the team secured a podium finish with the #30 BMW M4 GT3, taking second place after strong comebacks from a challenging qualifying session.\n\nSheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Charles Weerts (BEL) had to fight their way forward from 24th on the grid in the #32 BMW M4 GT3. Thanks to a perfect strategy, the car was running in third place with 20 minutes remaining. However, the finish was highly turbulent following a restart after a safety car period. In the battle for the podium, debris got in front of the radiator, and Vanthoor ultimately dropped back. In the drivers’ standings of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Vanthoor and Weerts finished the season in second place, just 2.5 points behind the leaders.\n\nIn the #46 BMW M4 GT3, Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) started from 23rd and, through clever strategy by BMW M Team WRT, even briefly took the lead. From there, they were in the mix for podium contention, ultimately finishing in fifth place after the dramatic closing stages.\n\nThe ROWE Racing #998 BMW M4 GT3, which had qualified best among the BMWs with 11th place, was also performing well in the race. The trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Max Hesse (GER), and Dan Harper (GBR) were in a strong position until Harper was hit heavily in the rear during a full course yellow period. Although Harper managed to bring the BMW M4 GT3, featuring the livery of BMW M Motorsport partner MultiBank Group, back to the pits, a damage in the chassis area meant a bitter, premature end to their race.\n\nIn the drivers’ standings of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Vanthoor and Weerts finished the combined sprint and endurance season in second place, just 2.5 points behind the leaders. The team title decision remains pending as the results of a previous race have yet to be officially confirmed.\n\nIn the Bronze Cup, Jens Klingmann (GER), Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), and Sam De Haan (GBR) also staged a comeback in the #30 BMW M4 GT3, starting from eighth place and finishing second on the podium after six thrilling hours of racing. Unfortunately, the Paradine Competition #991 BMW M4 GT3 from Century Motorsport retired after just one hour due to a technical defect while being driven by Toby Sowery (GBR). Sowery and his teammates Jake Dennis and Darren Leung (both GBR) had qualified third in the Bronze category. Leung, Harper and Paradine Competition had previously won the drivers’ and team titles in the Bronze category at the Barcelona (ESP) sprint finale.\n\nSuccesses in the GT4 European Series.\n\nAt the GT4 European Series finale, also held in Jeddah over the weekend, BMW M Motorsport teams again had reasons to celebrate. Ricardo van der Ende (NED) and Benjamin Lessenes (BEL) claimed second place overall and in the Silver class in the second of two races with the #17 BMW M4 GT4 from L’Espace Bienvenue. They finished third in the final Silver class championship standings. Pedro Carvalho Ebrahim (BRA) from Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport earned the “Rookie of the Year” award. In the Am category, Antoni de Barn and Jean-Mathieu Leandri (both FRA) drove the #317 BMW M4 GT4 from Team Chazel Technologie Course to second place in their class in both races.\n\nQuotes after the Jeddah season finale:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “We all expected a spectacular season finale in Jeddah – and that’s exactly what we got. Congratulations to the BMW M Team WRT, which stands at the top of the overall team standings in the GT World Challenge Europe after a long season. In practice and qualifying, our BMW M4 GT3s struggled a bit on the tight street circuit, but once again, the race pace was very strong. Add to that the right strategic decisions in a race with multiple yellow and safety car periods. A podium in the Pro class would have been well deserved, but positions were reshuffled in the final phase. With car number 32, we were on a secure podium position and thus on track for the title, but then, unfortunately, debris got in front of the radiator, and we lost positions in the first laps after the safety car. I am confident the #998 from ROWE Racing would have also been in contention for the podium if it hadn’t been forced to retire early through no fault of its own. That is racing, but I think everyone can be proud of what they did. Congratulations to the crew of the #30 car for another Bronze podium finish after their fantastic overall win at Monza. I want to thank all the teams and drivers for their hard work and dedication this season. I also want to congratulate our customer racing teams in the GT4 European Series, who rose to the challenge of Jeddah magnificently.”\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal BMW M Team WRT: “As we say, a hard one to swallow. The last 20 minutes were a bit crazy. We were fighting for P2, giving us the Overall Drivers and Endurance Teams championships, on top of the Overall Teams’ title. At the end, due to debris we got in the radiator, we had to slow down. We lost three positions, and two titles. Anyway, we finish second in the Overall Drivers championship, 2.5 points behind Maro Engel and Lucas Auer. Congrats to them. In the end, we are still Overall (Sprint and Endurance) Teams champions, which is a great reward! It was a tough season but a good one. We had some ups and downs, but we will remember the exceptional win of car 30 in Monza. It was a special and incredible one with a 1-2 finish. This is what I will remember from the Endurance Championship!”\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf, Team Principal ROWE Racing: “It’s somewhat symbolic that this season ends like this. It started perfectly with the Le Castellet victory, but after that, we had a lot of bad luck with retirements, tyre failures, unavoidable contacts, and accidents. The performance was always there, and we could fight at the front, but you can’t control such things. It’s tough for the team; you feel powerless. Even though you’re doing a good job, the results are missing. The team had to endure a lot, but the fact that we still managed to deliver every time and once again fought for the title until the very last race of the season shows how strong our team is.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 4th place): “It has been my first time in Jeddah as for everybody here. The weekend was quite eventful weekend. We were lacking a bit of pace during the different practice sessions and in qualifying. We made a good step for the race, we had a great car. It was nice to drive! We had good fights and we had a shot at the podium. It’s a shame that we lost it in the last moments but that’s part of racing. Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes not. Overall we can say it was a good race where we showed again the potential of the BMW M4 GT3 and where we gained 20 positions. It’s a good way to finish the season even though I believe a podium would have been deserved.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 5th place): “It was a very good race for us because we started from P23 and were able to arrive in the top five at the end and we were fighting for the podium until the last lap. I think that we worked very well this weekend and we were able to improve. From the season in general, I expected more, especially as our line-up is great with Raffaele Marciello and Maxime Martin. I think that often we had a good speed but we were a bit unlucky. We had good races, we won, we got some podiums. We were not able to achieve a podium in an endurance race, that was the target. But in the end, it was a good season.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#30 OQ by Oman Racing BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 2nd place Bronze Cup): “I am happy that we have brought the car home in P2. It is very difficult to drive on this track because the walls don’t leave margin for any errors. This was a huge challenge. We got a penalty for track limits which is very critical on this track but we managed to come back from that. That was the key to this race and we finished in the highest position we could aim for. I think that P1 was never in our reach. The winners were just too strong tonight so we maximised our result. It was good fun and we enjoy being on the podium on such a difficult street circuit. In this season, we had ups and downs. The longer the season went, the better we got. The highlight was the overall victory at Monza that no one can take from us and which was the first time in history. It’s been good season in a highly contested GT3 championship, so I am still very proud. Thanks to the whole team for the support and effort. It has been a pure joy.”\n\nDan Harper (#998 BMW M4 GT3, ROWE Racing, DNF): “After a difficult weekend up until qualifying we were happy with P11 in qualifying. Augusto did a great job in the beginning because it is obviously so tight here. A lot can happen. He stayed clean and gained a couple of positions. It was perfect. Unfortunately then when I got in the car was a full course yellow very quickly. I was just settling into the rhythm. Coming from turn three into four, the car in front of me braked for the countdown so I also braked at the same point as him. But then from behind I got hit. I have been never hit so hard in my life actually, so it kind of hurt initially but thankfully I’m okay now. But the car couldn’t continue, the suspension was broken. It’s just a shame for everybody. Obviously it’s a long way to come here.

A hole-in-one is a highlight for players and spectators at any golf tournament, but the one that Viktor Hovland produced at the BMW Championship in the Wilmington Country Club last year has proved to be of considerably greater importance. Traditionally, BMW donates a full four-year scholarship for the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF) for the first hole-in-one at the penultimate play-off tournament on the PGA TOUR. Diana Llamas has been named as the recipient of the sixth such scholarship in the history of the tournament. The young lady from Chicago is a first-generation college student and the third member of her family to earn the Evans Scholarship, following her brothers Jose (Marquette) and Daniel (Northwestern), and will study Environmental Technology at the University of Illinois.\n\n“Being the third sibling to earn the Evans Scholarship means everything to my family. I’m so honored to be named the BMW Hole-in-One Scholar, and my brothers are so proud,” said Llamas, who plans to study environmental engineering. “The endless opportunities that come along with being an Evans Scholar are incredible – especially this one to meet Viktor Hovland, who helped make this possible for me.”\n\nLlamas met Hovland and Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management for People and Places, BMW AG, at the third round of the BMW Championship at Olympia Fields Country Club. “We are proud of our longstanding partnership with the Western Golf Association, and of the great impact the BMW Championship makes in the lives of so many young scholars,” said Horstmeier. “BMW believes strongly in the role corporations play in supporting organizations like the Evans Scholars Foundation, which creates opportunities for young people to reach their full potential.”\n\nAll proceeds from the 2023 BMW Championship benefit the ESF which funds full college tuition and housing scholarships for deserving caddies across the country. Since 2007, the BMW Championshp has raised more than $45 million in support of the ESF, helping more than 3,300 students achieve their dreams of attending college.\n\nHorstmeier had already paid a visit to the Evans Scholars House at Northwestern University, the oldest of the ESF houses in the USA, where the scholars live together on campus.

An initiative by FNB Art Joburg and BMW Group South Africa, the BMW Young Collectors Co. was established in 2020 to develop a new generation of art collectors. Opening the BMW Young Collectors Co. programme to the public, The BMW Art Generation brings celebrated, established, and young artists, curators, and academics, from across the world together with collectors to shape, celebrate and protect the future of contemporary African art. Hosted at William Kentridge’s Centre for the Less Good Idea, The BMW Art Generation will give the public access to studios, performance art, live music and a boutique lifestyle market with stalls dedicated to demonstrating the very best in design and food and wine experiences.\n\nLooking to bring leading artists from Africa and the diaspora to explore contemporary African art within the realm of black intellectual tradition, the weekend presents multiple opportunities to create a thought experiment that inserts an African narrative where art meets history and place. Foregrounding an ethos that fosters innovation, community and an Africa that will continue to set standards for the global contemporary art ecosystem, The BMW Art Generation prioritises access through the transference of knowledge, from one generation to another.\n\n“Johannesburg is home to FNB Art Joburg, the longest running contemporary art fair on the African continent. Feeding off the city’s grit, desperation, tenacity and irreverent energy, artists, curators, and cultural policy makers living in or visiting Johannesburg understand its position and growing potential to be the continent’s cultural capital,” says Mandla Sibeko, Managing Director of FNB Art Joburg. “Hosted in central Johannesburg, where culture thrives and informs community’s daily lives, The BMW Art Generation also seeks to reignite engagement and investment dedicated to stimulating and sustaining the city as a natural incubator for contemporary art.”\n\nThe BMW Art Generation will welcome the likes of American collector and radiologist, Dr. Joy Simmons; Founder and Director of the Lagos Photo Festival and the African Artists' Foundation (AAF), Azu Nwagbogu; Princeton-based Nigerian artist and historian, Chika Okeke-Agulu; Swiss curator and director at the Serpentine Galleries, Hans Ulrich Obrist and South African artist William Kentridge. A pilgrimage for some and a homecoming for others, the BMW Art Generation is an opportunity for long overdue connections.\n\nMarcelle Duncan, Head of Brand of BMW Group South Africa says, “For over 50 years, the BMW Group have created valuable partnerships within the arts and culture landscape and engaged in over 100 cultural collaborations worldwide. BMW Group South Africa remains committed to showing the importance of corporate cultural responsibility through consistent and intentional investment in contemporary art and design. Our partnership with FNB Art Joburg is a proud relationship, having created great opportunities before and intending to open even more doors now.”\n\nBMW Young Collectors’ Co.An initiative by FNB Art Joburg and BMW Group South Africa, the BMW Young Collectors Co. was established in 2020 to develop a new generation of art collectors that will collect and buy African art on African soil. By cultivating a fresh perspective on art patronage, the initiative has the power to create a new generation of collectors that will ensure the African art economy continues to grow for generations to come. The BMW Young Collectors’ Co. aims to fill an education and experience void in the field of art collecting, where - in South Africa - the majority of collectors are older than 50 years of age and lack diversity. The initiative affords future generations of collectors access to first-hand experiences with the country’s top artists, galleries and art patrons. This essential programming ensures the continent is growing its Africa art economy for generations to come.\n\nFNB Art JoburgBased in Johannesburg, FNB Art Joburg is the leading and longest running contemporary African art fair on the continent. FNB Art Joburg plays an instrumental role in developing and sustaining a commercial industry that centres around African and diasporic practitioners. A platform where curatorial and commercial interventions meet, the fair is divided into six specialised sections: gallery HUB, gallery LAB, MAX, ETC, AUX, and ORG sections.\n\nView the full programme: Here is what to expect - A story by FNB Art Joburg\n\nTo visit The BMW Art Generation please note that entrance tickets are required:\n\nFriday, September 1, 2023: 6pm (VIP Opening, by invitation only)Saturday, September 2, 2023: 10am to 6pm (Public Day 1)Sunday, September 3, 2023; 10am to 6pm (Public Day 2)\n\nLocationThe Centre for the Less Good IdeaArts On Main264 Fox St & Berea RdMaboneng, Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nTo visit FNB Art Joburg please note that entrance tickets are required:\n\nThursday, September 7, 2023: 6pm to 9pm (VIP Opening, by invitation only)Friday, September 8, 2023: 11am to 8pmSaturday, September 9, 2023: 11am to 7pmSunday, September 10, 2023: 11am to 5pm\n\nLocationSandton Convention CentreExhibition 2161 Maude StreetSandown, Sandton,Johannesburg, 2196, South Africa"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Corporate, Cultural Engagement"}]}

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\n+++ Tigst Assefa (ETH) is the fastest female marathon runner in the world, with a time of 2:11:53 hours +++ Eliud Kipchoge (KEN) wins his fifth title in Berlin in 2:02:42 hours +++ German record goes to Amanal Petros (2:04:58 hours) +++ 48,000 athletes celebrate a sporting festival with fans in the capital +++\n\nBerlin. The 49th BMW BERLIN MARATHON again underlined the event’s reputation for record breaking runs. Leading the way this year was defending champion Tigst Assefa, who thrilled roughly a million fans along the 42.195-kilometre route with a blistering time. At the finish, the clock on the lead car – the first all-electric BMW i5 – stopped at 2:11:53 hours, meaning the Ethiopian had smashed the previous world record by a sensational 2:11 minutes. Last year’s champion also triumphed again in the men’s race. Eliud Kipchoge’s time of 2:02.42 minutes may not have beaten his world record from last year, but he still made history; the Kenyan became the first runner to win the fastest marathon in the world five times.\n\n“More than 60,000 people gave amazing sporting performances at the 2023 BMW BERLIN MARATHON, from the youngest in the mini-Marathon to the running elite, who again dazzled with world-class times. They all deserve great respect, although Tigst Assefa’s historic performance obviously stands out. Congratulations on an impressive world record,” said Stefan Teuchert, Head of BMW Group Deutschland. “As title partner for the twelfth time, the BMW Group is proud to have again contributed to the success of this diverse event, which brings together people from all over the world. Our thanks to go everyone who helped to make the BMW BERLIN MARATHON a unique experience: the team at our partner SCC EVENTS, the 7,500 volunteers, and all the fans along the route.”\n\nRight from the word go, Assefa left no doubt that she had grand intentions for the 2023 BMW BERLIN MARATHON. At every intermediate timing point, the 29-year-old had extended her average over the time of Brigid Kosgei (KEN) at the same distance when she set the previous world record (Chicago, 2019, 2:14:04). A lead of almost six minutes over second-placed Sheila Chepkirui (2:17:29) underlined the fact that Assefa was in a league of her own. Third place went to Magdalena Shaun from Tanzania (2:18:41). Domenika Meyer (2:23:47) was the best-placed German, finishing 14th.\n\n“I did not expect to run so fast and go under 2:12 hours. However, that is the result of hard work. I hope this victory inspires a lot of women, particularly from underprivileged areas, to set themselves goals and to fight for those goals,” said Assefa.\n\nKipchoge also started very quickly and was on course for a world record at times. However, the double Olympic champion was not quite able to maintain the high pace. Despite that, he still took a relatively comfortable victory to claim his fifth title at the BMW BERLIN MARATHON, having also triumphed in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022. The 38-year-old now has one win more to his name than Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie.\n\nSecond and third across the finish line were two debutants in the Abbott World Marathon Majors, the six biggest marathons in the world. Vincent Kipkemoi (KEN, 2:03:13) and Tadese Takele (ETH, 2:03:24) gave excellent performances. The same can be said of Amanal Petros, who became the first German runner to break the 2:05-hour barrier. The best-placed European finished ninth in a time of 2:04:58 hours.\n\nThe women’s handbike race produced a German one-two, with Julia Dierkesmann winning ahead of Katrin Möller and France’s Meggie Gay. Victory in the men’s race went to Frenchman Joseph Fritsch. His compatriot Johan Qualie and Germany’s Vico Merklein were second and third.\n\nThe fastest man in a wheelchair was Marcel Hug. The Swiss came home ahead of Daniel Romanchuk (USA) and David Weir (GBR). In the women’s race, winner Catherine Debrunner (SUI) was joined on the podium by Eden Rainbow Cooper (GBR) and Manuela Schär (SUI).\n\nTitle partner BMW supported the BMW BERLIN MARATHON with 66 electric route and organisational vehicles. The all-electric BMW i5 and BMW i4 were used as lead cars. The BMW iX safety car was also emission-free, as were six BMW CE 04 scooters. The marathon was a home outing for the two-wheelers that are produced at the BMW Group plant in Berlin.\n\nThe BMW Group Plant Berlin can look back on a long tradition of motorcycle manufacturing. BMW motorcycles have been produced in Berlin-Spandau since 1969. With over 2,200 employees and a capacity of up to 900 motorcycles and premium e-scooters per day, the plant is the heart of BMW Motorrad’s global production. 28 to 33 models are produced in Berlin – that is almost the entire range of BMW Motorrad models.

Despite that, he still took a relatively comfortable victory to claim his fifth title at the BMW BERLIN MARATHON, having also triumphed in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022. The 38-year-old now has one win more to his name than Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie.\n\nSecond and third across the finish line were two debutants in the Abbott World Marathon Majors, the six biggest marathons in the world. Vincent Kipkemoi (KEN, 2:03:13) and Tadese Takele (ETH, 2:03:24) gave excellent performances. The same can be said of Amanal Petros, who became the first German runner to break the 2:05-hour barrier. The best-placed European finished ninth in a time of 2:04:58 hours.\n\nThe women’s handbike race produced a German one-two, with Julia Dierkesmann winning ahead of Katrin Möller and France’s Meggie Gay. Victory in the men’s race went to Frenchman Joseph Fritsch. His compatriot Johan Qualie and Germany’s Vico Merklein were second and third.\n\nThe fastest man in a wheelchair was Marcel Hug. The Swiss came home ahead of Daniel Romanchuk (USA) and David Weir (GBR). In the women’s race, winner Catherine Debrunner (SUI) was joined on the podium by Eden Rainbow Cooper (GBR) and Manuela Schär (SUI).\n\nTitle partner BMW supported the BMW BERLIN MARATHON with 66 electric route and organisational vehicles. The all-electric BMW i5 and BMW i4 were used as lead cars. The BMW iX safety car was also emission-free, as were six BMW CE 04 scooters. The marathon was a home outing for the two-wheelers that are produced at the BMW Group plant in Berlin.\n\nThe BMW Group Plant Berlin can look back on a long tradition of motorcycle manufacturing. BMW motorcycles have been produced in Berlin-Spandau since 1969. With over 2,200 employees and a capacity of up to 900 motorcycles and premium e-scooters per day, the plant is the heart of BMW Motorrad’s global production. 28 to 33 models are produced in Berlin – that is almost the entire range of BMW Motorrad models. Roughly 80 percent of the motorcycles manufactured are exported to more than 130 countries around the world."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Four BMW M Hybrid V8s, two continents. The BMW M Motorsport LMDh prototypes are facing an intense racing weekend. While BMW M Team WRT competes at Imola (ITA) with two Hypercars in the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) for the second race of the season, BMW M Team RLL is aiming for the season’s first podium in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) at Long Beach (USA). The BMW M4 GT3 is targeting the podium in both Italy and California.\n\nFIA WEC: BMW M Team WRT competes at Imola.\n\nAt the 6 Hours of Imola, the FIA WEC is making its first European stop this year. BMW M Motorsport engineers and BMW M Team WRT have analysed the challenging season opener in Qatar with the two BMW M Hybrid V8s over the past weeks and have worked intensively to improve the car. Behind the wheel of car #15 are Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER). The sister car, the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, is shared by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA).\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, Team WRT made a strong impression in Qatar, with the #46 BMW M4 GT3 narrowly missing the podium at the opener. At Imola, the crew will be carried by a special tailwind; Valentino Rossi (ITA) starts his home race, with the Imola track being less than two hours’ drive from his birthplace Urbino (ITA). The 45-year-old Italian will join Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) and BMW M works driver Maxime Martin (BEL) for the 6 Hours of Imola. Driven by numerous Tifosi expected along the track, the local hero and his team-mates are aiming for a podium finish. In the sister car, the #31 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M works driver Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR) will take turns.\n\nThe Imola race starts on Sunday at 13:00 CEST.\n\nIMSA series: Street circuit at Long Beach as a good omen.\n\nTwo BMW M Hybrid V8s are also required in the IMSA series this coming weekend. BMW M Team RLL starts with good memories on the Long Beach street circuit. Last year, Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) celebrated second place on the podium in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8. Philipp Eng (AUT) and Augusto Farfus (BRA) completed the strong team result in the GTP class with a fourth place.\n\nWith the momentum from 2023 results, the team and drivers want to underline the strong performance of the BMW M Hybrid V8 from the first two weekends of the current year and finally reward themselves with the first podium in the third race of the IMSA season. As last year, De Phillippi and Yelloly start in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8. Eng shares the sister #24 car this year with Jesse Krohn (FIN).\n\nIn the GTD class, BMW M Motorsport teams also look back on an impressive history at Long Beach. Paul Miller Racing triumphed last year with the #1 BMW M4 GT3. In 2024, Turner Motorsport sends a BMW M4 GT3 onto the 3.167-kilometre track. BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) enter the 100-minute sprint race with car #96. The shortest race of the season – alongside the Detroit Grand Prix – starts on Saturday at 16:35 local time (22:35 CEST).\n\nStatement before the races at Imola and Long Beach:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are facing the first race weekend where we are competing with the BMW M Hybrid V8 at two major events on two continents simultaneously. We are competing on the biggest stages of prototype racing against top-notch competition. It’s spectacular and exactly the challenge we’ve been looking forward to since BMW M Motorsport’s entry into the LMDh category was confirmed. At the FIA WEC opener in Qatar, we realised that we need to improve significantly to compete at the level we expect of ourselves in the world championship. We have worked hard over the past weeks and expect to be able to make the first progress at Imola. In the IMSA series, we experienced one of our strongest races at Long Beach in 2023. With second and fourth places, we were very close to our first victory with the BMW M Hybrid V8. Now we hope that we can fight for the lead again this time and thus convert the speed we have already shown at Daytona and Sebring into top results. Both in the FIA WEC and in the IMSA series, we are also very well positioned with the BMW M4 GT3. I expect our teams to have a chance of winning in both racing series.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8): “I am really looking forward to competing in the FIA WEC again this weekend. Italy is a beautiful country. I like the ambiance, the food, and the people – so I’m really looking forward to it. Imola is a very historic racetrack that I know from DTM. In 2022, I made it to the podium there, so I have good memories. We have conducted some tests and simulator sessions since the opener in Qatar and hopefully will make a step forward.”\n\nMaxime Martin (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3): “It will be a special weekend for us because it’s Valentino's home race in the FIA WEC. I therefore expect it to be very crowded, and I anticipate many spectators with high expectations at the track. Our first race in Qatar was really solid with a fourth-place finish. We will try to improve our package and aim for the podium. That would be a good result, also in terms of the world championship. I know the track and am confident that Ahmad, Valentino, and I will be competitive. I’m really looking forward to it.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (BMW M Team RLL, #24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “I am really looking forward to the race at Long Beach. It’s a very cool track for the first sprint race of the season. Last year we had a strong race here. We have developed the car in a good direction, and the result of the 12h Sebring did not fully reflect our performance. We have made some adjustments, and I am confident that we can achieve a top result.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Four BMW M Hybrid V8s, two continents.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nMunich. BMW is bringing innovation and electric mobility into new areas of life with its new electric stand-up paddleboard (SUP). The BMW x SipaBoards is the product of a collaboration with Slovenian manufacturer SipaBoards, the market leader in the field. The boards are self-inflating and combine electric drive technology with high-grade materials, digital connectivity and a flexible energy system. This is the first time BMW has offered an electrically powered product designed for water sports, opening up a new chapter in riding pleasure in the process. BMW Group Designworks took care of the visuals.\n\nElectric lifestyle on the water.\n\nStand-up paddleboarding has grown into an extremely popular, on-trend sport over recent years. It brings together physical activity, immersion in nature and low barriers to entry – and therefore appeals to first-timers and experienced water sports enthusiasts alike. The BMW x SipaBoards brings a new dimension to the paddleboarding experience in the form of electric assistance, connectivity and intuitive control. The result is a new level of mobility on the water and the confluence of comfort and adventure.\n\nAt the heart of the BMW x SipaBoards is an integrated motor generating up to 300 watts of power. It produces additional thrust while on the move and makes paddling easier – especially into headwinds or currents. The drivetrain, with a propeller developed specifically for BMW, runs emission-free and near silently, and delivers a unique riding experience at speeds of up to 7.5 km/h (4 knots). The motor also comes in handy by pumping up the board automatically before you head out. The requisite energy is supplied by battery modules, which are available with a range of different capacities – to respond to individual requirements – and can be swapped out in just a few simple steps.\n\nStructural solidity and extensive connectivity.\n\nIts specially developed X-woven drop-stitch core gives the e-SUP superb structural rigidity and stability. The board is intuitive to use, via a new user interface (UI) with Bluetooth remote control – whose design was inspired by the BMW Neue Klasse – built into the paddle. It allows the rider to toggle into FREUDE Mode for extra power, eye-catching light effects and haptic feedback. A smartphone app brings additional functionality, enabling users to plan routes, for example, monitor the battery charge and utilise GPS tracking. An additional safety feature is the automatic power cut-off, which is triggered by a Bluetooth signal.

BMW is bringing innovation and electric mobility into new areas of life with its new electric stand-up paddleboard (SUP). The BMW x SipaBoards is the product of a collaboration with Slovenian manufacturer SipaBoards, the market leader in the field. The boards are self-inflating and combine electric drive technology with high-grade materials, digital connectivity and a flexible energy system. This is the first time BMW has offered an electrically powered product designed for water sports, opening up a new chapter in riding pleasure in the process. BMW Group Designworks took care of the visuals.\n\nElectric lifestyle on the water.\n\nStand-up paddleboarding has grown into an extremely popular, on-trend sport over recent years. It brings together physical activity, immersion in nature and low barriers to entry – and therefore appeals to first-timers and experienced water sports enthusiasts alike. The BMW x SipaBoards brings a new dimension to the paddleboarding experience in the form of electric assistance, connectivity and intuitive control. The result is a new level of mobility on the water and the confluence of comfort and adventure.\n\nAt the heart of the BMW x SipaBoards is an integrated motor generating up to 300 watts of power. It produces additional thrust while on the move and makes paddling easier – especially into headwinds or currents. The drivetrain, with a propeller developed specifically for BMW, runs emission-free and near silently, and delivers a unique riding experience at speeds of up to 7.5 km/h (4 knots). The motor also comes in handy by pumping up the board automatically before you head out. The requisite energy is supplied by battery modules, which are available with a range of different capacities – to respond to individual requirements – and can be swapped out in just a few simple steps.\n\nStructural solidity and extensive connectivity.\n\nIts specially developed X-woven drop-stitch core gives the e-SUP superb structural rigidity and stability. The board is intuitive to use, via a new user interface (UI) with Bluetooth remote control – whose design was inspired by the BMW Neue Klasse – built into the paddle. It allows the rider to toggle into FREUDE Mode for extra power, eye-catching light effects and haptic feedback. A smartphone app brings additional functionality, enabling users to plan routes, for example, monitor the battery charge and utilise GPS tracking.

Excitement was palpable today at Golfclub München Eichenried ahead of the tournament rounds of the 36thBMW International Open (July 2–6, 2025) – among amateurs, who got to play a memorable round with a pro in the Pro-Am tournament, among professionals set to compete for one of the most coveted titles on the DP World Tour starting tomorrow, and among fans, who witnessed a host of celebrities on the course.\n\nThe only German winner in the tournament’s history, Martin Kaymer, teed off alongside “Golden Goal” hero Oliver Bierhoff, former national player Tim Borowski, and coach Ralph Hassenhüttl (AUT). A “golden trio” was formed by six-time Olympic luge champions Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt (doubles), together with Michael Greis, three-time Olympic biathlon champion. Ice hockey was also well represented by NHL stars Moritz Seider and Tim Stützle, as well as national team player Maximilian Kastner. Former world-class tennis player and record winner of the BMW Open in Munich, Philipp Kohlschreiber, also proved his skills with a golf club.\n\nFrom the film industry, actors Kai Wiesinger and Kostja Ullmann, as well as director, screenwriter, and producer Florian Gallenberger, joined the event. A native of Munich, Gallenberger won an Oscar in 2001 in the Best Live Action Short Film category.

You can really feel how much passion and attention to detail everyone at BMW puts in. That makes it very pleasant for us players. It's a luxury on the DP World Tour to be able to play here. I’m always grateful and, as a German, proud that we have such a fantastic event. It’s a joy to come here every time.”\n\nMarcel Siem (GER): \"I don’t usually say this before a tournament, but I finally want to win here. That’s always my goal when I come. I’ve been coming here since I was a kid and even became club champion. No one knows the course better than I do. I want to win and put on a great show.”\n\nEwen Ferguson (SCO): \"I’ve always loved coming to this tournament. Munich is such a beautiful city. It’s always a pleasure to be here. The course, the event, the infrastructure, the player’s lounge, the food—everything is fantastic. Coming back as the defending champion and seeing my face around the venue is a great feeling.”\n\nTobias Arlt (GER): \"It’s just awesome to be part of the BMW International Open. It’s incredibly beautiful to play in this weather. Enjoying the Pro-Am with the pros and learning from them is amazing.”\n\nTobias Wendl (GER): \"It’s so impressive to see what the professionals can do, but it’s also great to see the people. We’re usually alone on the golf course. That’s why it’s great to see how many people are passionate about the sport.”\n\nMichael Greis (GER): \"The pros are just insane.

That’s a very important and meaningful part of my job - to talk to them and see how they play. Playing the course yourself gives you a better understanding.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\n“With the new BMW R 1300 GS we will once again take the competition by surprise. It is defined by an even broader spread of product substance, while the reduction in complexity and vehicle weight, combined with focused equipment, enable the essence of the boxer GS to be showcased even more strikingly. With a new engine, outstanding handling and impressive ride qualities, it will set the pace both on and off the road.”Thilo Fuchs, Head of Water-cooled Boxer Models. The new BMW R 1300 GS: “Next level GS” featuring new boxer engine and new suspension, with significantly reduced weight and increased GS competence all round.BMW Motorrad established the new segment of touring enduros more than four decades ago with the R 80 G/S. The BMW GS with boxer engine has been the undisputed leader of the competitive field ever since. To ensure this remains the case in the future, BMW Motorrad has opted for an almost completely new design for the new R 1300 GS, with an impressive weight saving of 12 kg compared to the previous model. The centrepiece is once again the legendary two-cylinder boxer engine. Its new design is more compact than ever before thanks to a gearbox located under the engine and a new camshaft drive arrangement. From exactly 1 300 cc it produces an output of 107 kW (145 hp) at 7 750 rpm, developing a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm. This makes it by far the most powerful BMW boxer engine ever to be produced in series. At the centre of the new suspension is the sheet metal shell main frame made of steel, which in addition to being significantly optimised in terms of installation space also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. For the rear frame, the previous tubular steel structure has now been replaced with a die-cast aluminium construction. The new EVO Telelever front wheel guide with flex element and the revised EVO Paralever rear wheel guide also provide even greater steering precision and ride stability. New electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) as optional equipment ex works, with dynamic adaptation of the damping and spring rate, and also load compensation.The previous Dynamic ESA Next Generation electronic suspension itself provided a high level of ride safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains with its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear. The new electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. The automatic adjustment of the spring rest ensures load compensation. This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience on all surfaces. Whether solo, in pairs or with bulky luggage – DSA ensures an even higher level of ride safety, performance and comfort. Adaptive vehicle height control and sports suspension as optional equipment ex works.Exclusively in conjunction with DSA as optional equipment ex works, two further items of optional equipment are available for the suspension of the new R 1300 GS: the new adaptive vehicle height control and the sports suspension. With adaptive vehicle height control, the new R 1300 GS offers fully automatic adjustment of the vehicle height depending on the operating condition, thereby ensuring the greatest possible comfort without having to compromise on riding dynamics and banking freedom. With 20 mm more spring travel at the front and rear and an optional athletically firm sports suspension specially developed for the GS, off-road riders are well catered for here. Four riding modes now standard. “Enduro” riding mode for an enhanced off-road riding experience.Even in standard trim, the new R 1300 GS now has four rather than three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. With the “Eco” riding mode it is possible to achieve the maximum range on a single tank of fuel, while the additional riding mode “Enduro” enables an enhanced riding experience off the beaten track with a specific set-up for off-road use. Matrix LED headlamps with innovative design as standard, state-of-the-art LED light units all round with turn indicators integrated in the hand protectors and Headlight Pro as optional equipment ex works.BMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 GS offers a new, very small full LED headlamp with a novel, distinctive light icon as standard. This illuminates the road with a hitherto unrivalled clarity, thereby ensuring even better perception in traffic. The light unit consists of two LED units for low and high beam along with four additional LED units for the daytime running light and the side light. State-of-the-art LED light units with newly designed LED turn indicators – integrated in the hand protectors at the front, function-integrated at the rear – round off the lighting concept of the new R 1300 GS. With the optional equipment item “Headlight Pro”, the beam of the standard full LED headlamp turns into the bend according to the banking position. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. Riding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Change Warning (SWW) for safe and convenient motorcycling.The new BMW R 1300 GS features the new Riding Assistant option, consisting of the components Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Change Warning (SWW). Active Cruise Control (ACC) with integrated distance control can be used to set the desired riding speed as well as the distance to the vehicle in front. Front Collision Warning (FCW) with brake intervention is designed to prevent collisions and help reduce the severity of accidents, while Lane Change Warning monitors the lanes to the left and right and can help ensure a safe lane change while supporting use of the rear mirror. The new R 1300 GS: the very highest level of touring and off-road expertise in an attractive basic variant along with the variants Triple Black, GS Trophy and Option 719 Tramuntana.The new R 1300 GS features an entirely new design which is based on the traditional GS flyline while at the same time reflecting extreme compactness and significant weight reduction. With a new aluminium fuel tank that has a much flatter ramp than on the predecessor models, the flyline is largely responsible for the very dynamic, light and accessible appearance of the new R 1300 GS. Here it was also possible to add a very sporty and dynamic accentuation by means of the continuous texture in the fuel tank centre cover. The basic variant of the new BMW R 1300 GS perfectly embodies what the BMW Motorrad development team has endowed the GS legend with: compact arrangement of the components, high functionality of the equipment – and everything focused on the essentials. In Lightwhite solid paint and in conjunction with its sharply drawn lines and very clean appearance, the new R 1300 GS has a muscular appearance and embodies the boxer GS theme in pristine style. TripleBlack is a model variant of the boxer GS that has been popular for many years. In this colour scheme, the new BMW R 1300 GS has a masculine attitude combined with exclusive surfaces. The basic finish Racingblue metallic sets the tone for the model variant GS Trophy. With red and white tapes and inscriptions combined with a rear frame coated in white metallic matt, the GS Trophy stands for the very highest level of performance and sporty off-road riding. The new R 1300 GS shows its exclusive and technically sophisticated side in the model variant Option 719 Tramuntana. This combines cross-spoke wheels in gold with a high-quality paint finish in Aurelius Green metallic and sophisticated milled aluminium parts.

It is defined by an even broader spread of product substance, while the reduction in complexity and vehicle weight, combined with focused equipment, enable the essence of the boxer GS to be showcased even more strikingly. With a new engine, outstanding handling and impressive ride qualities, it will set the pace both on and off the road.”Thilo Fuchs, Head of Water-cooled Boxer Models. The new BMW R 1300 GS: “Next level GS” featuring new boxer engine and new suspension, with significantly reduced weight and increased GS competence all round.BMW Motorrad established the new segment of touring enduros more than four decades ago with the R 80 G/S. The BMW GS with boxer engine has been the undisputed leader of the competitive field ever since. To ensure this remains the case in the future, BMW Motorrad has opted for an almost completely new design for the new R 1300 GS, with an impressive weight saving of 12 kg compared to the previous model. The centrepiece is once again the legendary two-cylinder boxer engine. Its new design is more compact than ever before thanks to a gearbox located under the engine and a new camshaft drive arrangement. From exactly 1 300 cc it produces an output of 107 kW (145 hp) at 7 750 rpm, developing a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm. This makes it by far the most powerful BMW boxer engine ever to be produced in series. At the centre of the new suspension is the sheet metal shell main frame made of steel, which in addition to being significantly optimised in terms of installation space also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. For the rear frame, the previous tubular steel structure has now been replaced with a die-cast aluminium construction. The new EVO Telelever front wheel guide with flex element and the revised EVO Paralever rear wheel guide also provide even greater steering precision and ride stability. New electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) as optional equipment ex works, with dynamic adaptation of the damping and spring rate, and also load compensation.The previous Dynamic ESA Next Generation electronic suspension itself provided a high level of ride safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains with its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear. The new electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. The automatic adjustment of the spring rest ensures load compensation. This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience on all surfaces. Whether solo, in pairs or with bulky luggage – DSA ensures an even higher level of ride safety, performance and comfort. Adaptive vehicle height control and sports suspension as optional equipment ex works.Exclusively in conjunction with DSA as optional equipment ex works, two further items of optional equipment are available for the suspension of the new R 1300 GS: the new adaptive vehicle height control and the sports suspension. With adaptive vehicle height control, the new R 1300 GS offers fully automatic adjustment of the vehicle height depending on the operating condition, thereby ensuring the greatest possible comfort without having to compromise on riding dynamics and banking freedom. With 20 mm more spring travel at the front and rear and an optional athletically firm sports suspension specially developed for the GS, off-road riders are well catered for here. Four riding modes now standard. “Enduro” riding mode for an enhanced off-road riding experience.Even in standard trim, the new R 1300 GS now has four rather than three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. With the “Eco” riding mode it is possible to achieve the maximum range on a single tank of fuel, while the additional riding mode “Enduro” enables an enhanced riding experience off the beaten track with a specific set-up for off-road use. Matrix LED headlamps with innovative design as standard, state-of-the-art LED light units all round with turn indicators integrated in the hand protectors and Headlight Pro as optional equipment ex works.BMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 GS offers a new, very small full LED headlamp with a novel, distinctive light icon as standard. This illuminates the road with a hitherto unrivalled clarity, thereby ensuring even better perception in traffic. The light unit consists of two LED units for low and high beam along with four additional LED units for the daytime running light and the side light. State-of-the-art LED light units with newly designed LED turn indicators – integrated in the hand protectors at the front, function-integrated at the rear – round off the lighting concept of the new R 1300 GS. With the optional equipment item “Headlight Pro”, the beam of the standard full LED headlamp turns into the bend according to the banking position. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. Riding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Change Warning (SWW) for safe and convenient motorcycling.The new BMW R 1300 GS features the new Riding Assistant option, consisting of the components Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Change Warning (SWW). Active Cruise Control (ACC) with integrated distance control can be used to set the desired riding speed as well as the distance to the vehicle in front. Front Collision Warning (FCW) with brake intervention is designed to prevent collisions and help reduce the severity of accidents, while Lane Change Warning monitors the lanes to the left and right and can help ensure a safe lane change while supporting use of the rear mirror. The new R 1300 GS: the very highest level of touring and off-road expertise in an attractive basic variant along with the variants Triple Black, GS Trophy and Option 719 Tramuntana.The new R 1300 GS features an entirely new design which is based on the traditional GS flyline while at the same time reflecting extreme compactness and significant weight reduction. With a new aluminium fuel tank that has a much flatter ramp than on the predecessor models, the flyline is largely responsible for the very dynamic, light and accessible appearance of the new R 1300 GS. Here it was also possible to add a very sporty and dynamic accentuation by means of the continuous texture in the fuel tank centre cover. The basic variant of the new BMW R 1300 GS perfectly embodies what the BMW Motorrad development team has endowed the GS legend with: compact arrangement of the components, high functionality of the equipment – and everything focused on the essentials. In Lightwhite solid paint and in conjunction with its sharply drawn lines and very clean appearance, the new R 1300 GS has a muscular appearance and embodies the boxer GS theme in pristine style. TripleBlack is a model variant of the boxer GS that has been popular for many years. In this colour scheme, the new BMW R 1300 GS has a masculine attitude combined with exclusive surfaces. The basic finish Racingblue metallic sets the tone for the model variant GS Trophy. With red and white tapes and inscriptions combined with a rear frame coated in white metallic matt, the GS Trophy stands for the very highest level of performance and sporty off-road riding. The new R 1300 GS shows its exclusive and technically sophisticated side in the model variant Option 719 Tramuntana. This combines cross-spoke wheels in gold with a high-quality paint finish in Aurelius Green metallic and sophisticated milled aluminium parts.

But no matter where I am on-site, I always keep an eye on the performances of the BMW M Motorsport customer teams worldwide. I’m absolutely thrilled that we celebrated numerous additional victories and podiums with the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 in Europe and North America. We are now entering the crunch time of the season, and titles will soon be decided. Every single success is all the more valuable. Congratulations to all teams and drivers! Keep it up – the entire BMW M Motorsport family is rooting for you in these decisive weeks.\"\n\nIMSA series (22nd-24th August): BMW M Motorsport teams narrowly miss the podium. At the GT race of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Virginia International Raceway (USA), Paul Miller Racing and Turner Motorsport delivered strong performances but were not rewarded with a podium finish. In the GTD PRO class, Madison Snow and Neil Verhagen (both USA) finished sixth. The duo had started the race from second position and even led at times in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Paul Miller Racing. However, they were unlucky with the timing of a yellow flag about an hour before the end, which caused them to fall back. The yellow flag was triggered by the sister car with number 48. Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER), who had started from third place, were also in a promising position but retired due to a technical issue.\n\nIn the GTD class, Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) drove a strong race in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Turner Motorsport, finishing fourth in their class.

They had also reached the podium in their class in the first race but were later penalised.\n\nGT America (15th-17th August): Another podium for Justin Rothberg. In the GT America races at Road America (USA), championship leader Justin Rothberg (USA) secured another podium finish. Driving the #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Turner Motorsport, Rothberg finished third in the second race. In Saturday’s first race, heavy rain created extremely challenging conditions, and Rothberg retired while battling for the podium. The race was abandoned and not restarted, with Rothberg classified fifth.\n\nGT4 America (15th-17th August): One race, three BMW M4 GT4 EVOs on the podium. The heavy rain on Saturday also had a massive impact on the GT4 America races at Road America (USA). While the GT World Challenge America and GT America managed to hold their Saturday races partially, the GT4 America had to cancel its first race due to a thunderstorm with lightning. It will be rescheduled at the next race weekend. However, Sunday’s race went ahead, and in the turbulent event, three BMW M4 GT4 EVOs secured podium finishes. Kenton Koch and Kevin Boehm (both USA) finished second overall in the #97 BMW M4 GT4 EVO of Random Vandals Racing, which also meant second in the Silver class, solidifying their championship lead. In the #82 car of BimmerWorld Racing, James Walker Jr. and Tyler McQuarrie (both USA) claimed third place in the Pro-Am class. The Am category victory went to the #17 BMW M4 GT4 EVO of Rigid Speed Company, driven by Joseph and Lucas Catania (both USA).\n\nNLS (16th August): Seven class wins for BMW M Motorsport teams on the Nordschleife. In mid-August, the BMW M Motorsport teams returned to the Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie (NLS) for the sixth race of the season, the KW 6h ADAC Ruhr-Pokal-Rennen. They secured seven class wins and additional podium finishes. The BMW M4 GT4 EVO was successful in three categories. The quartet of Carrie Schreiner, Janina Schall, Patricija Stalidzane (all GER), and Beitske Visser (NED) claimed victory in the AT3 class with the #146 car of GITI Tire Motorsport by WS Racing. The SP8T class win went to the #187 BMW M4 GT4 EVO of FK Performance Motorsport, driven by Ranko Mijatovic (SUI), Nick Wüstenhagen, and Tobias Wahl (both GER). In this highly competitive class, BMW M4 GT4 EVOs achieved a fivefold victory. The podium was completed by the #150 car of Team Bilstein by Black Falcon and the #155 car of Plusline Motorsport in second and third positions. In the SP10 category, the AV Racing by Black Falcon team secured third place on the podium with the #163 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. Additionally, BMW M Motorsport teams celebrated victories in the BMW 325i, BMW M240i, SP4, V3, and VT3 classes.\n\nBTCC (15th-17th August): Two wins for Jake Hill at Knockhill. “King of the Hill” – this title is awarded by the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) to the most successful driver at the races in Knockhill, Scotland. This year, fittingly, it goes to Jake Hill (GBR). The reigning champion won two of the three races with his #1 BMW 330i M Sport of LKQ Euro Car Parts with WSR and added a fifth-place finish. In the first race, the team even celebrated a one-two finish: Charles Rainford (GBR) took second place in the #99 BMW 330i M Sport, behind his victorious teammate Hill."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Following the fourth race weekend of the 2023 FIM Superbike World Championship in Barcelona (ESP), BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team headed straight to Misano in Italy for two days of testing on Thursday and Friday. In the saddle were BMW Motorrad WorldSBK works riders Scott Redding (GBR), Loris Baz (FRA) and Garrett Gerloff (USA), as well as Tom Sykes (GBR), who has returned to the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK family as a temporary replacement for the injured Michael van der Mark (NED).\n\nBMW Motorrad Motorsport and the two teams used the test to improve the handling and overall performance of the new BMW M 1000 RR, evaluating various solutions, including in the areas of geometry and set-up. For Sykes, the priority at Misano was to familiarise himself with the latest version of the bike.\n\nOn the first day of testing, weather conditions have been mainly dry, sunny and stable until a thunderstorm caused a red flag in the late afternoon. The second day of testing saw rain in the morning, followed by another thunderstorm in the later afternoon. The test served as preparation for the next races. The season continues with round five at Misano from 2nd to 4th June.\n\nQuotes after the Misano test.\n\nGarrett Gerloff, #31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I wasn’t really expecting to have so many dry laps, so that’s positive, for sure. Yesterday was really good, we made a lot of progress. We tried just small things but all the small things add up. We ended the day in a good position and I was happy with that. Today, we did not go out before the rain so we did not have any dry laps in the morning. In the afternoon just the grip did not feel so great but anyway, we were happy with how the test went, especially yesterday. We have a lot of information for the race coming up soon, so I am looking forward to that.”\n\nScott Redding, #45 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “In the dry, track conditions were really good. We tested some parts which gave me a better feeling on the bike which I am quite happy with. I feel I can push the bike a little bit more which is what I am looking for. But still I struggle to achieve a better lap time when I push for it. But here in those track conditions, the consistency was really good and I was fast with many laps on the tyre, but I could not make a step with a new tyre. That is something that we need to work on. Even if rain interrupted things a bit, it was good to have two days of testing here and try to improve.”\n\nTom Sykes, #66 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I’m very grateful for getting this opportunity and to be here. I know the team very well from the past, but obviously I am on the other side of the garage now, so the first thing we did was setting up a plan for our work. I was very happy with the way things went. Run by run, we tried more to understand the package and to get myself comfortable again with the BMW. Honestly, I was very happy with the progress we kept making. Day two was interrupted with rain so we did some wet and function testing to get forward. Credit to BMW and the entire team; since I was last riding the bike, they have continued to move forward and made big steps with the bike, for example regarding the engine and electronics. Overall it has been a very productive test and I am looking forward to the upcoming event at Misano.”\n\nLoris Baz, #76 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “The focus at this test was to be back a bit more natural on the bike, especially with my leg. The couple of races that I have contested since I came back, I was of course not riding naturally. It is still not perfect, and the foot was more painful at Misano than it was at Barcelona due to all the changes of direction so we have not done too many laps but focused on trying to get back a feeling with the front and a better turning of the bike again. There we were struggling more this season compared to last year. I think that we made a good step in that direction. We have also been a bit lucky with the weather as two days of rain had been predicted and we still had good laps on the dry. I did most of the test with the SC0, my best lap time was with really old tyres. So the test was pretty okay. Now I am looking forward to three more weeks of recovery for my leg because it is still locking me in the right–hand corners and changes of direction.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Following the fourth race weekend of the 2023 FIM Superbike World Championship in Barcelona (ESP), BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team headed straight to Misano in Italy for two days of testing on Thursday and Friday."}]}

Credit to BMW and the entire team; since I was last riding the bike, they have continued to move forward and made big steps with the bike, for example regarding the engine and electronics. Overall it has been a very productive test and I am looking forward to the upcoming event at Misano.”\n\nLoris Baz, #76 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “The focus at this test was to be back a bit more natural on the bike, especially with my leg. The couple of races that I have contested since I came back, I was of course not riding naturally. It is still not perfect, and the foot was more painful at Misano than it was at Barcelona due to all the changes of direction so we have not done too many laps but focused on trying to get back a feeling with the front and a better turning of the bike again. There we were struggling more this season compared to last year. I think that we made a good step in that direction. We have also been a bit lucky with the weather as two days of rain had been predicted and we still had good laps on the dry. I did most of the test with the SC0, my best lap time was with really old tyres. So the test was pretty okay. Now I am looking forward to three more weeks of recovery for my leg because it is still locking me in the right–hand corners and changes of direction.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW Motorrad Motorsport completes productive WorldSBK test at Misano."}]}

Today, we did not go out before the rain so we did not have any dry laps in the morning.

But still I struggle to achieve a better lap time when I push for it. But here in those track conditions, the consistency was really good and I was fast with many laps on the tyre, but I could not make a step with a new tyre. That is something that we need to work on.

Nurturing young racing talent has been one of the cornerstones of BMW M Motorsport’s programme for decades. Most recently, BMW Junior Team made waves in GT racing for several years, nurturing talents such as Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Neil Verhagen (USA) into accomplished BMW M works drivers. In a high-profile line-up, they join forces with Charles Weerts (BEL) to form the group born after the turn of the millennium. For the 2024 season, BMW M Motorsport has given them a name and a new logo: Gen2K.\n\n“Generation 2000”, comprising the three members of the BMW Junior Team and Weerts, who has already achieved numerous successes in GT racing at a young age with Team WRT in recent years, embodies BMW M Motorsport’s approach to infuse its line-up with not only experience but also youthful dynamism making it as versatile as possible.\n\nThe Gen2K racing programme is also diverse. Harper, Hesse, and Weerts will contest the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER) in June in the BMW M Team RMG BMW M4 GT3. While Harper and Hesse have grown up on the Nordschleife as part of their training and have contested many races there, Weerts will make his debut at the endurance classic in the Eifel region. The trio will hit the track for the first time in the BMW M4 GT3 this coming weekend during test sessions ahead of the start of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NES) season.\n\nMoreover, all three drivers will compete in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, albeit for different teams. Harper and Hesse for ROWE Racing, Weerts for BMW M Team WRT. Additionally, Hesse will undertake race outings for BMW Team Italia Ceccato Racing in the Italian GT Championship, while Harper will participate in selected events of the British GT Championship, where he clinched the driver’s title in 2023. Verhagen will contest the entire season of the Fanatec GT World Challenge America powered by AWS for ST Racing in North America, as well as the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup races for Paul Miller Racing.\n\nBeyond their race commitments, there will be joint events with the Gen2K members, and they may also serve as mentors for an even younger generation of motorsport talent, leveraging their experience gained during their training. Details regarding this will be announced at a later date. Just like with the BMW Junior Team, BMW M Motorsport legend Jochen Neerpasch will mentor Gen2K. The Gen2K logo will accompany the drivers on their racing suits as well as on vehicles.\n\nQuotes about the Gen2K:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are generally very proud of our line-up of BMW M works drivers, but particularly proud of its diversity. Our drivers hail from twelve different nations, spanning ages from 23 to 55 years old, nine of them are younger than 30. To have four drivers born in the year 2000 and later who already have several years of experience at the highest level is remarkable. Added to that, we have international champions like Sheldon van der Linde and Dries Vanthoor, who are only slightly older than the Gen2K drivers. This forward-thinking line-up is impressive.”\n\nDan Harper: “Being part of the new Gen2K sounds very cool! It’s great to see how many young drivers BMW M Motorsport has in its line-up and how fast they are. I’m excited to see what lies ahead for me. Furthermore, I’m very much looking forward to competing for the fourth time with BMW M Team RMG on the Nordschleife. Charles is new to the team and will be tackling the 24-hour race in a GT3 car for the first time, but I’m sure he has the optimal crew by his side to quickly find his speed.”\n\nMax Hesse: “The Gen2K concept from BMW M Motorsport sounds awesome, and the logo looks cool! I’m very excited to be a part of it. Getting to start again on the Nordschleife with BMW M Team RMG is great. The team led by Stefan Reinhold has been doing a fantastic job for years. Now it’s time to reward that effort with a strong result at the 24-hour race. With Charles, we’ve already spent some days together in the race simulator and get along very well. Testing on the track starts this coming weekend, and I can hardly wait.”\n\nCharles Weerts: “The fact that an iconic brand like BMW M Motorsport has some young works drivers in its line-up shows their confidence in youth and their vision for the future of racing. For me, it’s a great experience to be a part of it. I’m particularly looking forward to the new challenge of the 24 Hours of Nürburgring on this iconic track. I’ll give it my all and can’t wait to start working with BMW M Team RMG.”\n\nNeil Verhagen: “The fact that I - just like Dan and Max - am now entering my fifth season with BMW M Motorsport demonstrates how much the brand cares about nurturing young drivers. I’m very proud to be a works driver for a brand with such deep motorsport roots and look forward to representing BMW M Motorsport again in the upcoming season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nurturing young racing talent has been one of the cornerstones of BMW M Motorsport’s programme for decades.

Nurturing young racing talent has been one of the cornerstones of BMW M Motorsport’s programme for decades. Most recently, BMW Junior Team made waves in GT racing for several years, nurturing talents such as Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Neil Verhagen (USA) into accomplished BMW M works drivers. In a high-profile line-up, they join forces with Charles Weerts (BEL) to form the group born after the turn of the millennium. For the 2024 season, BMW M Motorsport has given them a name and a new logo: Gen2K.\n\n“Generation 2000”, comprising the three members of the BMW Junior Team and Weerts, who has already achieved numerous successes in GT racing at a young age with Team WRT in recent years, embodies BMW M Motorsport’s approach to infuse its line-up with not only experience but also youthful dynamism making it as versatile as possible.\n\nThe Gen2K racing programme is also diverse. Harper, Hesse, and Weerts will contest the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER) in June in the BMW M Team RMG BMW M4 GT3. While Harper and Hesse have grown up on the Nordschleife as part of their training and have contested many races there, Weerts will make his debut at the endurance classic in the Eifel region. The trio will hit the track for the first time in the BMW M4 GT3 this coming weekend during test sessions ahead of the start of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NES) season.\n\nMoreover, all three drivers will compete in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, albeit for different teams. Harper and Hesse for ROWE Racing, Weerts for BMW M Team WRT. Additionally, Hesse will undertake race outings for BMW Team Italia Ceccato Racing in the Italian GT Championship, while Harper will participate in selected events of the British GT Championship, where he clinched the driver’s title in 2023. Verhagen will contest the entire season of the Fanatec GT World Challenge America powered by AWS for ST Racing in North America, as well as the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup races for Paul Miller Racing.\n\nBeyond their race commitments, there will be joint events with the Gen2K members, and they may also serve as mentors for an even younger generation of motorsport talent, leveraging their experience gained during their training. Details regarding this will be announced at a later date. Just like with the BMW Junior Team, BMW M Motorsport legend Jochen Neerpasch will mentor Gen2K. The Gen2K logo will accompany the drivers on their racing suits as well as on vehicles.\n\nQuotes about the Gen2K:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are generally very proud of our line-up of BMW M works drivers, but particularly proud of its diversity. Our drivers hail from twelve different nations, spanning ages from 23 to 55 years old, nine of them are younger than 30. To have four drivers born in the year 2000 and later who already have several years of experience at the highest level is remarkable. Added to that, we have international champions like Sheldon van der Linde and Dries Vanthoor, who are only slightly older than the Gen2K drivers. This forward-thinking line-up is impressive.”\n\nDan Harper: “Being part of the new Gen2K sounds very cool! It’s great to see how many young drivers BMW M Motorsport has in its line-up and how fast they are. I’m excited to see what lies ahead for me. Furthermore, I’m very much looking forward to competing for the fourth time with BMW M Team RMG on the Nordschleife. Charles is new to the team and will be tackling the 24-hour race in a GT3 car for the first time, but I’m sure he has the optimal crew by his side to quickly find his speed.”\n\nMax Hesse: “The Gen2K concept from BMW M Motorsport sounds awesome, and the logo looks cool! I’m very excited to be a part of it. Getting to start again on the Nordschleife with BMW M Team RMG is great. The team led by Stefan Reinhold has been doing a fantastic job for years. Now it’s time to reward that effort with a strong result at the 24-hour race. With Charles, we’ve already spent some days together in the race simulator and get along very well. Testing on the track starts this coming weekend, and I can hardly wait.”\n\nCharles Weerts: “The fact that an iconic brand like BMW M Motorsport has some young works drivers in its line-up shows their confidence in youth and their vision for the future of racing. For me, it’s a great experience to be a part of it. I’m particularly looking forward to the new challenge of the 24 Hours of Nürburgring on this iconic track. I’ll give it my all and can’t wait to start working with BMW M Team RMG.”\n\nNeil Verhagen: “The fact that I - just like Dan and Max - am now entering my fifth season with BMW M Motorsport demonstrates how much the brand cares about nurturing young drivers. I’m very proud to be a works driver for a brand with such deep motorsport roots and look forward to representing BMW M Motorsport again in the upcoming season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gen2K: BMW M Motorsport unveils new logo for its “young guns” – Start at the 24h Nürburgring."}]}

In the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé and the BMW i4, the optional Adaptive LED Headlights will now also include laser rear lights.\n\nMore power, reduced consumption for BMW M240i xDrive Coupé and the entry-level models into the world of BMW M in the BMW 3 Series and BMW 4 Series.\n\nNew exterior colours for the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé, Adaptive LED headlights available for more BMW 4 Series models, practical addition for the BMW 5 Series family. From autumn 2025, an additional exterior colour will be available as an option for all versions of the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé with the M Sport design or the M Sport package. Cape York Green can be ordered for the first time in conjunction with these trim levels.\n\nThe optional Adaptive LED Headlights for the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé and BMW i4 will also benefit from a significant upgrade. In addition to headlights that will illuminate the road evenly in every situation, this option will now also include laser rear lights. Moreover, Adaptive LED Headlights are also available as an individual option without the M Sport package Pro for the BMW 420i, BMW 420d and BMW 420d xDrive.\n\nIn conjunction with Veganza and Merino upholstery, the comprehensive standard equipment in the BMW X3 now also includes rear headrests and side sections of the second row of seats in the upholstery colour. This further enhances the premium appeal of the BMW X3 interior.\n\nAll BMW 5 Series, BMW i5 and BMW M5 Sedan and Touring models will in future offer a very handy feature.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at summarizing BMW news articles. Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nThe model-specific performance characteristics of the six-cylinder in-line engine in the BMW M4 CS, an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and M xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive imbue the new special edition with dynamic poise and assurance in any situation. Instantaneous power delivery and optimised traction enable acceleration of 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds. In testing at the Nürburgring’s Nordschleife circuit – the ultimate barometer for all BMW M cars when it comes to the signature M recipe of dynamic potency, agility and handling precision – the new BMW M4 CS recorded an official and notarised time of 7 min. 21.989 sec. for the full 20.832-kilometre (12.943-mile) lap.\n\nSix-cylinder in-line engine developed for motor sport .\n\nThe race-focused character of the new BMW M4 CS is immediately recognisable and a noticeable companion over every journey. The special edition is powered by a particularly muscular version of the high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology developed for the BMW M3/BMW M4 range. The 3.0-litre unit has had track performance as its raison d’être from day one of its development. Indeed, it also provides the basis for the engine in the BMW M4 GT3, which won the DTM touring car title in 2022 at the first time of asking and followed that up in 2023 with overall victories at the 24-hour races in Spa-Francorchamps and Dubai.\n\nThe engine in the new BMW M4 CS therefore also benefits from the development expertise of BMW M GmbH and the many years of racing experience that underpin it. The engine has an extremely rigid crankcase, which features a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction and is designed to handle very high combustion pressure. The forged lightweight crankshaft also displays exceptional torsional resistance, which plays a role in giving the engine its rapid power delivery and appetite for revs. The wire-arc sprayed iron coating of the likewise weight-saving cylinder bores reduces frictional losses. The cylinder head, meanwhile, has a 3D-printed core. This additive manufacturing process allows the coolant ducts to be routed in an optimum arrangement for temperature management that would be impossible to achieve using conventional metal casting methods. And the system of oil supply – like the cooling system – is designed to handle the specific challenges of track use, including consistently high revs and extreme lateral acceleration.\n\nBespoke performance characteristics, distinctive sound.\n\nRacing technology provides the foundations for the extraordinary potential of the six-cylinder in-line engine, which produces maximum output of 405 kW/550 hp from under the bonnet of the new BMW M4 CS. This represents a 15 kW/20 hp increase over the figures achieved by the engine in the BMW M4 Competition Coupé with M xDrive. The power boost was achieved through targeted revisions to the engine’s M TwinPower Turbo technology and required no concessions in terms of stability or durability. The adjustments primarily involved raising the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and making some model-specific tweaks to the engine management.\n\nThe upgrades also produce a very specific take on familiar M performance characteristics, with instantaneous power delivery that continues unabated through to the upper echelons of the rev range a particularly dominant theme. The engine in the new BMW M4 CS puts its peak torque of 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) on tap from just 2,750 rpm up to 5,950 rpm. It develops maximum output at 6,250 rpm and has a 7,200 rpm red line. Contributing to the excellent engine response is a model-specific engine mounting with increased spring rates. The rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure enables particularly direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain every time the driver presses the accelerator.\n\nThe instantly available power and high-revving character of the engine pave the way for imposing acceleration figures. The new BMW M4 CS dashes from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 3.4 seconds, while 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) takes 11.1 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) is dealt with in 2.6 seconds in 4th gear and in 3.3 seconds in 5th gear. The top speed of the special edition – which comes as standard with the M Driver’s Package – is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph).\n\nThe engine’s power delivery is accompanied by the emotionally stirring soundtrack generated by the dual-branch exhaust system, which features electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt Black. The engine’s acoustic presence adjusts to the powertrain setting selected via the M Setup menu. In SPORT and SPORT+ modes, the engine note gains unmissable racing car undertones. This injects genuine aural drama into proceedings, particularly during gear changes and the accompanying adjustments in rev speed.\n\nEight-speed M Steptronic transmission, M xDrive and active M differential convert outstanding power into imposing performance.\n\nThe engine’s drive torque is relayed to all four wheels of the new BMW M4 CS via an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. This is operated using either the M-specific gear selector lever on the centre console or the carbon-fibre shift paddles on the steering wheel. The Drivelogic button integrated into the selector lever allows the driver to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics as desired, with a choice of settings available: one comfort-oriented, one for sports performance and one optimised specifically for track use.\n\nThe engine’s power is channelled onto the road by the M xDrive system. This intelligent all-wheel-drive technology uses an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer case to distribute the engine’s power smoothly between the front and rear wheels – and so maximise traction, agility and directional stability in any situation. The multi-plate clutch’s oil supply has been optimised to ensure the all-wheel-drive system continues to perform effectively even during ultra-intense track sessions.\n\nThe M xDrive system’s rear-wheel bias and the way it teams up with the Active M Differential at the rear axle – whose operation is also fully variable – add to the signature M feeling when accelerating or powering through corners. Furthermore, the M Setup menu allows 4WD Sport mode to be selected, which directs an even greater proportion of the engine’s torque to the rear wheels. Drivers can also switch off the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system altogether and engage pure rear-wheel drive via 2WD mode. This engages skilled drivers in the driving experience to an even more intense degree.\n\nModel-specific tuning for the chassis technology and control systems.\n\nThe chassis technology for the new BMW M4 CS has been tuned precisely to the performance characteristics of the engine, the overall vehicle concept and its weight distribution. The individually tuned axle kinematics and bespoke wheel camber settings, dampers, auxiliary springs and anti-roll bars serve to optimise steering precision, transmission of lateral control forces when cornering, spring and damping response and wheel location.\n\nThe electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension on the new BMW M4 CS likewise come in a model-specific setup, as do its electromechanical M Servotronic steering with variable ratio and its integrated braking system. The settings for the DSC system and M Dynamic Mode have also been purposefully geared to the specific demands of dynamic circuit driving. M Dynamic Mode gives drivers extra leeway to explore the car’s dynamic limits by pushing back the intervention points for the DSC system’s various stabilising measures. When the driver adopts an extremely sporty driving style, the resultant wheel slip ensures even better power transmission and helps to propel the car down the road with extra assurance.\n\nExclusive forged light-alloy wheels and track tyres fitted as standard.\n\nThe special-edition model is equipped as standard with M Compound brakes with callipers painted in a choice of Red or Black. The callipers for the optional M Carbon ceramic brakes can be specified in a Red or matt Gold painted finish. The new BMW M4 CS also comes as standard with forged M light-alloy wheels in an exclusive V-spoke design – available in either in matt Gold Bronze or matt Black.\n\nThe lightweight wheels (19-inch at the front axle and 20-inch at the rear) are fitted as standard with track tyres (ultra track tyres as option) to maximise the performance experience on the race track. Offering outstanding lateral control and directional stability, precise steering feel and optimum traction, these track tyres – in the dimensions 275/35 ZR19 (front) and 285/30 ZR20 (rear) – represent a compelling proposition, even when the driver is living out their sporting ambitions on a circuit. Customers intending to use their BMW M4 CS mostly for day-to-day driving can select high-performance tyres in the same sizes as a no-cost option.\n\nIntensive application of lightweight design with generous use of CFRP.\n\nExtensive lightweight design measures play a major part in moulding the performance qualities and exclusive character of the new BMW M4 CS. The use of components made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is of key importance here. The carbon-fibre roof is a prime example, its low weight bringing the car’s centre of gravity closer to the road and therefore enhancing agility and cornering dynamics. The bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps, rear diffuser and Gurney-style rear spoiler are also made from this lightweight, high-tech material.\n\nAdherence to the principle of intelligent lightweight design is also evident in the interior. Indeed, in the interests of reducing weight inside the cockpit, the centre console, shift paddles on the steering wheel and interior trim elements are all made from CFRP. The special-edition model also comes as standard with M Carbon bucket seats, whose weight-minimising construction is highlighted by the use of CFRP in the structural elements of the seat cushion and backrest as well as in the eye-catching cut-outs in the side bolsters and below the head restraints. Added to which, the exhaust system on the new BMW M4 CS is more than four kilograms lighter, thanks to the use of a titanium rear silencer. All in all, lightweight design measures bring the car’s weight down by around 20 kilograms compared to the BMW M4 Competition Coupé with M xDrive.\n\nOptional M front end strut brace maximises torsional rigidity.\n\nAn M front end strut brace – also engineered for lightness – can be specified as an option for the BMW M4 CS to increase torsional rigidity and improve handling through dynamically taken corners. The cast aluminium elements connecting the spring strut towers to the front end feature a weight-optimised geometry that has been precisely matched – with the help of numerical models – to the forces applied in various driving situations.\n\nExclusive design features promise thrilling performance.\n\nThe new BMW M4 CS instantly announces its sharper character with a series of individual design features. The new BMW Individual special paint finishes Riviera Blue and Frozen Isle of Man Green Metallic are available exclusively for the latest special-edition model from BMW M GmbH. Surfaces in exposed carbon fibre for the roof and the pair of indents chiselled into the bonnet showcase the material’s distinctive structure, as do the front splitter, front air intakes, M exterior mirror caps, rear spoiler and rear apron. Together with the Black side skirts and M gills, the CFRP elements provide a stunning contrast against the bold new paint finishes. The new BMW M4 CS can also be specified in the exterior shades M Brooklyn Grey metallic and Sapphire Black metallic.\n\nThe vehicle’s front end sports a weight-saving, frameless BMW kidney grille with a stripped-back feel reminiscent of racing machines. Designed especially for this model, its identifying features include red contour lines and the “M4 CS” badging on the upper of the two horizontal grille bars. Both the model badge at the front and its counterpart on the boot lid have black surfaces with a red border.\n\nEye-catching headlights add another flourish to the front end of the new BMW M4 CS. Their sculptural light icons illuminate yellow instead of white – both during the Welcome Light Animation and while low beam or high beam is switched on – and so reference successful GT racing cars. The rear lights of the BMW M4 CS make a visually powerful statement with their striking appearance during the hours of darkness. As well as generating a powerful radiance, their Laserlight technology is also marked out by intricate fibre optic bundles inside the light units, which have a “free-floating” appearance and are illuminated by a laser diode. The result is a prominent 3D effect. This technology was first seen in the BMW M4 CSL high-performance special edition produced in a limited run of 1,000 units, and now also brings an exclusive aesthetic to the BMW M4 CS.\n\nRacing flair in the cockpit: M Carbon bucket seats with exclusive design cues.\n\nExuding a puristic visual appeal, the cockpit of the BMW M4 CS focuses squarely on delivering an exhilarating driving experience, while also successfully blending its distinct racing aura with comfort features for everyday driving – thanks to high-quality materials and exclusive design elements. The standard M Alcantara steering wheel in three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim offers a perfect combination of secure grip for dynamic driving manoeuvres and impressive comfort on longer journeys. Its red centre marker and CFRP shift paddles add an authentic racing flavour to the cockpit. The standard M Carbon bucket seats in a model-specific design also fuse racing-car feel and long-distance comfort to exceptional effect. Fully electric and heated, they feature integral head restraints and an illuminated model badge.\n\nThe M Carbon bucket seats in the BMW M4 CS are upholstered in Merino leather and come in an exclusive design with a Black/Red colour scheme and distinctive contrast stitching. This bi-colour finish is carried over into the rear compartment of the high-performance sports car. Both the door panels in the front and the rear side panelling are trimmed entirely in Black leather. Red “CS” lettering on the centre console, M seat belts with contrast stitching in the BMW M GmbH colours, an Anthracite-coloured headliner, interior trim strips in Carbon Fibre finish and door sill plates with the inscription “M4 CS” all add to the exclusive ambience inside the car.\n\nBMW Curved Display with M-specific readouts, new BMW iDrive.\n\nThe latest version of the BMW iDrive display and control/operation system based on BMW Operating System 8.5 provides intuitive control of numerous vehicle functions and digital services. The BMW Curved Display features M-specific readouts and is angled towards the driver, helping them to focus on the road ahead. The fully digital screen grouping is formed by a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel and a control display with a screen diagonal of 14.9 inches. The familiar M Shift Lights appear at the top of the information display, while the driving stability system, M xDrive and traction control modes are all indicated in the lower area. Special widgets containing information on the current vehicle setup, as well as tyre pressures and temperature can be added to the control display’s home screen.\n\nThe upgraded BMW iDrive also comprises the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and has been designed with particular emphasis on touch and voice control. Besides the M-specific graphics, the system also now features a new way of operating the automatic climate control: the temperature and ventilation settings as well as the seat heating can be controlled either by touch using a special menu option in the lower area of the control display or by voice command.\n\nSetup button for customising vehicle configuration, M Drive Professional with M Drift Analyser and M Laptimer as standard.\n\nThe M-specific Setup button on the centre console enables direct access to the settings options for the engine, chassis, steering, braking system and M xDrive. Two individually configurable setup variants can be stored permanently, together with the preferred settings for the engine note, the DSC system, the Automatic Start/Stop function and the shift characteristics of the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, and then retrieved using one of the two M buttons on the steering wheel.\n\nAlso fitted as standard in the new BMW M4 CS is the M Drive Professional system. This includes track-optimised functions such as the M Drift Analyser, which evaluates and records purposefully executed cornering slides, and the M Laptimer, which provides detailed data on laps of the track and allows sporty-minded drivers to share their exploits with the community. It additionally comes with M Traction Control, whose ten stages also play their part in helping drivers enjoy the pleasure of driving the car enthusiastically on the track.\n\nThe M Mode button on the centre console is another tool in the M Drive Professional package and can be used to adjust both driver assistance system responses and the content shown in the information display and Head-Up Display. As well as the ROAD and SPORT settings, the BMW M4 CS also offers a TRACK mode designed exclusively for use on race circuits.\n\nTop-class options for added pleasure and comfort in everyday driving.\n\nThe specification of the standard BMW Live Cockpit Professional includes the BMW Head-Up Display with M-specific graphics, the cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system, smartphone integration, telephony with wireless charging and a WiFi interface. The BMW Drive Recorder is available as an option.\n\nThe new BMW M4 CS additionally offers customers a select choice of comfort features and driver assistance systems, with the focus firmly on the enjoyment of unadulterated driving pleasure.

The all-new BMW M4 CS (fuel consumption, combined 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 232 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G) takes the blend of attributes typically found in high-performance cars in the premium midsize segment and turns the emotional engagement dial up a few ...The model-specific performance characteristics of the six-cylinder in-line engine in the BMW M4 CS, an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and M xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive imbue the new special edition with dynamic poise and assurance in any situation. Instantaneous power delivery and optimised traction enable acceleration of 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds. In testing at the Nürburgring’s Nordschleife circuit – the ultimate barometer for all BMW M cars when it comes to the signature M recipe of dynamic potency, agility and handling precision – the new BMW M4 CS recorded an official and notarised time of 7 min. 21.989 sec. for the full 20.832-kilometre (12.943-mile) lap.\n\nSix-cylinder in-line engine developed for motor sport .\n\nThe race-focused character of the new BMW M4 CS is immediately recognisable and a noticeable companion over every journey. The special edition is powered by a particularly muscular version of the high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology developed for the BMW M3/BMW M4 range. The 3.0-litre unit has had track performance as its raison d’être from day one of its development. Indeed, it also provides the basis for the engine in the BMW M4 GT3, which won the DTM touring car title in 2022 at the first time of asking and followed that up in 2023 with overall victories at the 24-hour races in Spa-Francorchamps and Dubai.\n\nThe engine in the new BMW M4 CS therefore also benefits from the development expertise of BMW M GmbH and the many years of racing experience that underpin it. The engine has an extremely rigid crankcase, which features a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction and is designed to handle very high combustion pressure. The forged lightweight crankshaft also displays exceptional torsional resistance, which plays a role in giving the engine its rapid power delivery and appetite for revs. The wire-arc sprayed iron coating of the likewise weight-saving cylinder bores reduces frictional losses. The cylinder head, meanwhile, has a 3D-printed core. This additive manufacturing process allows the coolant ducts to be routed in an optimum arrangement for temperature management that would be impossible to achieve using conventional metal casting methods. And the system of oil supply – like the cooling system – is designed to handle the specific challenges of track use, including consistently high revs and extreme lateral acceleration.\n\nBespoke performance characteristics, distinctive sound.\n\nRacing technology provides the foundations for the extraordinary potential of the six-cylinder in-line engine, which produces maximum output of 405 kW/550 hp from under the bonnet of the new BMW M4 CS. This represents a 15 kW/20 hp increase over the figures achieved by the engine in the BMW M4 Competition Coupé with M xDrive. The power boost was achieved through targeted revisions to the engine’s M TwinPower Turbo technology and required no concessions in terms of stability or durability. The adjustments primarily involved raising the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and making some model-specific tweaks to the engine management.\n\nThe upgrades also produce a very specific take on familiar M performance characteristics, with instantaneous power delivery that continues unabated through to the upper echelons of the rev range a particularly dominant theme. The engine in the new BMW M4 CS puts its peak torque of 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) on tap from just 2,750 rpm up to 5,950 rpm. It develops maximum output at 6,250 rpm and has a 7,200 rpm red line. Contributing to the excellent engine response is a model-specific engine mounting with increased spring rates. The rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure enables particularly direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain every time the driver presses the accelerator.\n\nThe instantly available power and high-revving character of the engine pave the way for imposing acceleration figures. The new BMW M4 CS dashes from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 3.4 seconds, while 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) takes 11.1 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) is dealt with in 2.6 seconds in 4th gear and in 3.3 seconds in 5th gear. The top speed of the special edition – which comes as standard with the M Driver’s Package – is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph).\n\nThe engine’s power delivery is accompanied by the emotionally stirring soundtrack generated by the dual-branch exhaust system, which features electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt Black. The engine’s acoustic presence adjusts to the powertrain setting selected via the M Setup menu. In SPORT and SPORT+ modes, the engine note gains unmissable racing car undertones. This injects genuine aural drama into proceedings, particularly during gear changes and the accompanying adjustments in rev speed.\n\nEight-speed M Steptronic transmission, M xDrive and active M differential convert outstanding power into imposing performance.\n\nThe engine’s drive torque is relayed to all four wheels of the new BMW M4 CS via an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. This is operated using either the M-specific gear selector lever on the centre console or the carbon-fibre shift paddles on the steering wheel. The Drivelogic button integrated into the selector lever allows the driver to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics as desired, with a choice of settings available: one comfort-oriented, one for sports performance and one optimised specifically for track use.\n\nThe engine’s power is channelled onto the road by the M xDrive system. This intelligent all-wheel-drive technology uses an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer case to distribute the engine’s power smoothly between the front and rear wheels – and so maximise traction, agility and directional stability in any situation. The multi-plate clutch’s oil supply has been optimised to ensure the all-wheel-drive system continues to perform effectively even during ultra-intense track sessions.\n\nThe M xDrive system’s rear-wheel bias and the way it teams up with the Active M Differential at the rear axle – whose operation is also fully variable – add to the signature M feeling when accelerating or powering through corners. Furthermore, the M Setup menu allows 4WD Sport mode to be selected, which directs an even greater proportion of the engine’s torque to the rear wheels. Drivers can also switch off the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system altogether and engage pure rear-wheel drive via 2WD mode. This engages skilled drivers in the driving experience to an even more intense degree.\n\nModel-specific tuning for the chassis technology and control systems.\n\nThe chassis technology for the new BMW M4 CS has been tuned precisely to the performance characteristics of the engine, the overall vehicle concept and its weight distribution. The individually tuned axle kinematics and bespoke wheel camber settings, dampers, auxiliary springs and anti-roll bars serve to optimise steering precision, transmission of lateral control forces when cornering, spring and damping response and wheel location.\n\nThe electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension on the new BMW M4 CS likewise come in a model-specific setup, as do its electromechanical M Servotronic steering with variable ratio and its integrated braking system. The settings for the DSC system and M Dynamic Mode have also been purposefully geared to the specific demands of dynamic circuit driving. M Dynamic Mode gives drivers extra leeway to explore the car’s dynamic limits by pushing back the intervention points for the DSC system’s various stabilising measures. When the driver adopts an extremely sporty driving style, the resultant wheel slip ensures even better power transmission and helps to propel the car down the road with extra assurance.\n\nExclusive forged light-alloy wheels and track tyres fitted as standard.\n\nThe special-edition model is equipped as standard with M Compound brakes with callipers painted in a choice of Red or Black. The callipers for the optional M Carbon ceramic brakes can be specified in a Red or matt Gold painted finish. The new BMW M4 CS also comes as standard with forged M light-alloy wheels in an exclusive V-spoke design – available in either in matt Gold Bronze or matt Black.\n\nThe lightweight wheels (19-inch at the front axle and 20-inch at the rear) are fitted as standard with track tyres (ultra track tyres as option) to maximise the performance experience on the race track. Offering outstanding lateral control and directional stability, precise steering feel and optimum traction, these track tyres – in the dimensions 275/35 ZR19 (front) and 285/30 ZR20 (rear) – represent a compelling proposition, even when the driver is living out their sporting ambitions on a circuit. Customers intending to use their BMW M4 CS mostly for day-to-day driving can select high-performance tyres in the same sizes as a no-cost option.\n\nIntensive application of lightweight design with generous use of CFRP.\n\nExtensive lightweight design measures play a major part in moulding the performance qualities and exclusive character of the new BMW M4 CS. The use of components made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is of key importance here. The carbon-fibre roof is a prime example, its low weight bringing the car’s centre of gravity closer to the road and therefore enhancing agility and cornering dynamics. The bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps, rear diffuser and Gurney-style rear spoiler are also made from this lightweight, high-tech material.\n\nAdherence to the principle of intelligent lightweight design is also evident in the interior. Indeed, in the interests of reducing weight inside the cockpit, the centre console, shift paddles on the steering wheel and interior trim elements are all made from CFRP. The special-edition model also comes as standard with M Carbon bucket seats, whose weight-minimising construction is highlighted by the use of CFRP in the structural elements of the seat cushion and backrest as well as in the eye-catching cut-outs in the side bolsters and below the head restraints. Added to which, the exhaust system on the new BMW M4 CS is more than four kilograms lighter, thanks to the use of a titanium rear silencer. All in all, lightweight design measures bring the car’s weight down by around 20 kilograms compared to the BMW M4 Competition Coupé with M xDrive.\n\nOptional M front end strut brace maximises torsional rigidity.\n\nAn M front end strut brace – also engineered for lightness – can be specified as an option for the BMW M4 CS to increase torsional rigidity and improve handling through dynamically taken corners. The cast aluminium elements connecting the spring strut towers to the front end feature a weight-optimised geometry that has been precisely matched – with the help of numerical models – to the forces applied in various driving situations.\n\nExclusive design features promise thrilling performance.\n\nThe new BMW M4 CS instantly announces its sharper character with a series of individual design features. The new BMW Individual special paint finishes Riviera Blue and Frozen Isle of Man Green Metallic are available exclusively for the latest special-edition model from BMW M GmbH. Surfaces in exposed carbon fibre for the roof and the pair of indents chiselled into the bonnet showcase the material’s distinctive structure, as do the front splitter, front air intakes, M exterior mirror caps, rear spoiler and rear apron. Together with the Black side skirts and M gills, the CFRP elements provide a stunning contrast against the bold new paint finishes. The new BMW M4 CS can also be specified in the exterior shades M Brooklyn Grey metallic and Sapphire Black metallic.\n\nThe vehicle’s front end sports a weight-saving, frameless BMW kidney grille with a stripped-back feel reminiscent of racing machines. Designed especially for this model, its identifying features include red contour lines and the “M4 CS” badging on the upper of the two horizontal grille bars. Both the model badge at the front and its counterpart on the boot lid have black surfaces with a red border.\n\nEye-catching headlights add another flourish to the front end of the new BMW M4 CS. Their sculptural light icons illuminate yellow instead of white – both during the Welcome Light Animation and while low beam or high beam is switched on – and so reference successful GT racing cars. The rear lights of the BMW M4 CS make a visually powerful statement with their striking appearance during the hours of darkness. As well as generating a powerful radiance, their Laserlight technology is also marked out by intricate fibre optic bundles inside the light units, which have a “free-floating” appearance and are illuminated by a laser diode. The result is a prominent 3D effect. This technology was first seen in the BMW M4 CSL high-performance special edition produced in a limited run of 1,000 units, and now also brings an exclusive aesthetic to the BMW M4 CS.\n\nRacing flair in the cockpit: M Carbon bucket seats with exclusive design cues.\n\nExuding a puristic visual appeal, the cockpit of the BMW M4 CS focuses squarely on delivering an exhilarating driving experience, while also successfully blending its distinct racing aura with comfort features for everyday driving – thanks to high-quality materials and exclusive design elements. The standard M Alcantara steering wheel in three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim offers a perfect combination of secure grip for dynamic driving manoeuvres and impressive comfort on longer journeys. Its red centre marker and CFRP shift paddles add an authentic racing flavour to the cockpit. The standard M Carbon bucket seats in a model-specific design also fuse racing-car feel and long-distance comfort to exceptional effect. Fully electric and heated, they feature integral head restraints and an illuminated model badge.\n\nThe M Carbon bucket seats in the BMW M4 CS are upholstered in Merino leather and come in an exclusive design with a Black/Red colour scheme and distinctive contrast stitching. This bi-colour finish is carried over into the rear compartment of the high-performance sports car. Both the door panels in the front and the rear side panelling are trimmed entirely in Black leather. Red “CS” lettering on the centre console, M seat belts with contrast stitching in the BMW M GmbH colours, an Anthracite-coloured headliner, interior trim strips in Carbon Fibre finish and door sill plates with the inscription “M4 CS” all add to the exclusive ambience inside the car.\n\nBMW Curved Display with M-specific readouts, new BMW iDrive.\n\nThe latest version of the BMW iDrive display and control/operation system based on BMW Operating System 8.5 provides intuitive control of numerous vehicle functions and digital services. The BMW Curved Display features M-specific readouts and is angled towards the driver, helping them to focus on the road ahead. The fully digital screen grouping is formed by a 12.3-inch information display behind the steering wheel and a control display with a screen diagonal of 14.9 inches. The familiar M Shift Lights appear at the top of the information display, while the driving stability system, M xDrive and traction control modes are all indicated in the lower area. Special widgets containing information on the current vehicle setup, as well as tyre pressures and temperature can be added to the control display’s home screen.\n\nThe upgraded BMW iDrive also comprises the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and has been designed with particular emphasis on touch and voice control. Besides the M-specific graphics, the system also now features a new way of operating the automatic climate control: the temperature and ventilation settings as well as the seat heating can be controlled either by touch using a special menu option in the lower area of the control display or by voice command.\n\nSetup button for customising vehicle configuration, M Drive Professional with M Drift Analyser and M Laptimer as standard.\n\nThe M-specific Setup button on the centre console enables direct access to the settings options for the engine, chassis, steering, braking system and M xDrive. Two individually configurable setup variants can be stored permanently, together with the preferred settings for the engine note, the DSC system, the Automatic Start/Stop function and the shift characteristics of the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, and then retrieved using one of the two M buttons on the steering wheel.\n\nAlso fitted as standard in the new BMW M4 CS is the M Drive Professional system. This includes track-optimised functions such as the M Drift Analyser, which evaluates and records purposefully executed cornering slides, and the M Laptimer, which provides detailed data on laps of the track and allows sporty-minded drivers to share their exploits with the community. It additionally comes with M Traction Control, whose ten stages also play their part in helping drivers enjoy the pleasure of driving the car enthusiastically on the track.\n\nThe M Mode button on the centre console is another tool in the M Drive Professional package and can be used to adjust both driver assistance system responses and the content shown in the information display and Head-Up Display. As well as the ROAD and SPORT settings, the BMW M4 CS also offers a TRACK mode designed exclusively for use on race circuits.\n\nTop-class options for added pleasure and comfort in everyday driving.\n\nThe specification of the standard BMW Live Cockpit Professional includes the BMW Head-Up Display with M-specific graphics, the cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system, smartphone integration, telephony with wireless charging and a WiFi interface.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at classifying BMW news articles. Identify the article type based on its content and structure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify the type of the following BMW news article.\n\nInto the broad space between race track experience and soul-stirring road performance comes another BMW M GmbH special edition from the BMW M3 and BMW M4 range. The all-new BMW M4 CS (fuel consumption, combined 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 232 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G) takes the blend of attributes typically found in high-performance cars in the premium midsize segment and turns the emotional engagement dial up a few ...The model-specific performance characteristics of the six-cylinder in-line engine in the BMW M4 CS, an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and M xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive imbue the new special edition with dynamic poise and assurance in any situation. Instantaneous power delivery and optimised traction enable acceleration of 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds. In testing at the Nürburgring’s Nordschleife circuit – the ultimate barometer for all BMW M cars when it comes to the signature M recipe of dynamic potency, agility and handling precision – the new BMW M4 CS recorded an official and notarised time of 7 min. 21.989 sec. for the full 20.832-kilometre (12.943-mile) lap.\n\nSix-cylinder in-line engine developed for motor sport .\n\nThe race-focused character of the new BMW M4 CS is immediately recognisable and a noticeable companion over every journey. The special edition is powered by a particularly muscular version of the high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology developed for the BMW M3/BMW M4 range. The 3.0-litre unit has had track performance as its raison d’être from day one of its development. Indeed, it also provides the basis for the engine in the BMW M4 GT3, which won the DTM touring car title in 2022 at the first time of asking and followed that up in 2023 with overall victories at the 24-hour races in Spa-Francorchamps and Dubai.\n\nThe engine in the new BMW M4 CS therefore also benefits from the development expertise of BMW M GmbH and the many years of racing experience that underpin it. The engine has an extremely rigid crankcase, which features a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction and is designed to handle very high combustion pressure. The forged lightweight crankshaft also displays exceptional torsional resistance, which plays a role in giving the engine its rapid power delivery and appetite for revs. The wire-arc sprayed iron coating of the likewise weight-saving cylinder bores reduces frictional losses. The cylinder head, meanwhile, has a 3D-printed core. This additive manufacturing process allows the coolant ducts to be routed in an optimum arrangement for temperature management that would be impossible to achieve using conventional metal casting methods. And the system of oil supply – like the cooling system – is designed to handle the specific challenges of track use, including consistently high revs and extreme lateral acceleration.\n\nBespoke performance characteristics, distinctive sound.\n\nRacing technology provides the foundations for the extraordinary potential of the six-cylinder in-line engine, which produces maximum output of 405 kW/550 hp from under the bonnet of the new BMW M4 CS. This represents a 15 kW/20 hp increase over the figures achieved by the engine in the BMW M4 Competition Coupé with M xDrive. The power boost was achieved through targeted revisions to the engine’s M TwinPower Turbo technology and required no concessions in terms of stability or durability. The adjustments primarily involved raising the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and making some model-specific tweaks to the engine management.\n\nThe upgrades also produce a very specific take on familiar M performance characteristics, with instantaneous power delivery that continues unabated through to the upper echelons of the rev range a particularly dominant theme. The engine in the new BMW M4 CS puts its peak torque of 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) on tap from just 2,750 rpm up to 5,950 rpm. It develops maximum output at 6,250 rpm and has a 7,200 rpm red line. Contributing to the excellent engine response is a model-specific engine mounting with increased spring rates. The rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure enables particularly direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain every time the driver presses the accelerator.\n\nThe instantly available power and high-revving character of the engine pave the way for imposing acceleration figures. The new BMW M4 CS dashes from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 3.4 seconds, while 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) takes 11.1 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) is dealt with in 2.6 seconds in 4th gear and in 3.3 seconds in 5th gear. The top speed of the special edition – which comes as standard with the M Driver’s Package – is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph).\n\nThe engine’s power delivery is accompanied by the emotionally stirring soundtrack generated by the dual-branch exhaust system, which features electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt Black. The engine’s acoustic presence adjusts to the powertrain setting selected via the M Setup menu. In SPORT and SPORT+ modes, the engine note gains unmissable racing car undertones. This injects genuine aural drama into proceedings, particularly during gear changes and the accompanying adjustments in rev speed.\n\nEight-speed M Steptronic transmission, M xDrive and active M differential convert outstanding power into imposing performance.\n\nThe engine’s drive torque is relayed to all four wheels of the new BMW M4 CS via an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. This is operated using either the M-specific gear selector lever on the centre console or the carbon-fibre shift paddles on the steering wheel. The Drivelogic button integrated into the selector lever allows the driver to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics as desired, with a choice of settings available: one comfort-oriented, one for sports performance and one optimised specifically for track use.\n\nThe engine’s power is channelled onto the road by the M xDrive system. This intelligent all-wheel-drive technology uses an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer case to distribute the engine’s power smoothly between the front and rear wheels – and so maximise traction, agility and directional stability in any situation. The multi-plate clutch’s oil supply has been optimised to ensure the all-wheel-drive system continues to perform effectively even during ultra-intense track sessions.\n\nThe M xDrive system’s rear-wheel bias and the way it teams up with the Active M Differential at the rear axle – whose operation is also fully variable – add to the signature M feeling when accelerating or powering through corners. Furthermore, the M Setup menu allows 4WD Sport mode to be selected, which directs an even greater proportion of the engine’s torque to the rear wheels. Drivers can also switch off the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system altogether and engage pure rear-wheel drive via 2WD mode. This engages skilled drivers in the driving experience to an even more intense degree.\n\nModel-specific tuning for the chassis technology and control systems.\n\nThe chassis technology for the new BMW M4 CS has been tuned precisely to the performance characteristics of the engine, the overall vehicle concept and its weight distribution. The individually tuned axle kinematics and bespoke wheel camber settings, dampers, auxiliary springs and anti-roll bars serve to optimise steering precision, transmission of lateral control forces when cornering, spring and damping response and wheel location.\n\nThe electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension on the new BMW M4 CS likewise come in a model-specific setup, as do its electromechanical M Servotronic steering with variable ratio and its integrated braking system. The settings for the DSC system and M Dynamic Mode have also been purposefully geared to the specific demands of dynamic circuit driving. M Dynamic Mode gives drivers extra leeway to explore the car’s dynamic limits by pushing back the intervention points for the DSC system’s various stabilising measures. When the driver adopts an extremely sporty driving style, the resultant wheel slip ensures even better power transmission and helps to propel the car down the road with extra assurance.\n\nExclusive forged light-alloy wheels and track tyres fitted as standard.\n\nThe special-edition model is equipped as standard with M Compound brakes with callipers painted in a choice of Red or Black. The callipers for the optional M Carbon ceramic brakes can be specified in a Red or matt Gold painted finish. The new BMW M4 CS also comes as standard with forged M light-alloy wheels in an exclusive V-spoke design – available in either in matt Gold Bronze or matt Black.\n\nThe lightweight wheels (19-inch at the front axle and 20-inch at the rear) are fitted as standard with track tyres (ultra track tyres as option) to maximise the performance experience on the race track. Offering outstanding lateral control and directional stability, precise steering feel and optimum traction, these track tyres – in the dimensions 275/35 ZR19 (front) and 285/30 ZR20 (rear) – represent a compelling proposition, even when the driver is living out their sporting ambitions on a circuit. Customers intending to use their BMW M4 CS mostly for day-to-day driving can select high-performance tyres in the same sizes as a no-cost option.\n\nIntensive application of lightweight design with generous use of CFRP.\n\nExtensive lightweight design measures play a major part in moulding the performance qualities and exclusive character of the new BMW M4 CS. The use of components made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is of key importance here. The carbon-fibre roof is a prime example, its low weight bringing the car’s centre of gravity closer to the road and therefore enhancing agility and cornering dynamics. The bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps, rear diffuser and Gurney-style rear spoiler are also made from this lightweight, high-tech material.\n\nAdherence to the principle of intelligent lightweight design is also evident in the interior. Indeed, in the interests of reducing weight inside the cockpit, the centre console, shift paddles on the steering wheel and interior trim elements are all made from CFRP. The special-edition model also comes as standard with M Carbon bucket seats, whose weight-minimising construction is highlighted by the use of CFRP in the structural elements of the seat cushion and backrest as well as in the eye-catching cut-outs in the side bolsters and below the head restraints. Added to which, the exhaust system on the new BMW M4 CS is more than four kilograms lighter, thanks to the use of a titanium rear silencer. All in all, lightweight design measures bring the car’s weight down by around 20 kilograms compared to the BMW M4 Competition Coupé with M xDrive.\n\nOptional M front end strut brace maximises torsional rigidity.\n\nAn M front end strut brace – also engineered for lightness – can be specified as an option for the BMW M4 CS to increase torsional rigidity and improve handling through dynamically taken corners. The cast aluminium elements connecting the spring strut towers to the front end feature a weight-optimised geometry that has been precisely matched – with the help of numerical models – to the forces applied in various driving situations.\n\nExclusive design features promise thrilling performance.\n\nThe new BMW M4 CS instantly announces its sharper character with a series of individual design features. The new BMW Individual special paint finishes Riviera Blue and Frozen Isle of Man Green Metallic are available exclusively for the latest special-edition model from BMW M GmbH. Surfaces in exposed carbon fibre for the roof and the pair of indents chiselled into the bonnet showcase the material’s distinctive structure, as do the front splitter, front air intakes, M exterior mirror caps, rear spoiler and rear apron. Together with the Black side skirts and M gills, the CFRP elements provide a stunning contrast against the bold new paint finishes. The new BMW M4 CS can also be specified in the exterior shades M Brooklyn Grey metallic and Sapphire Black metallic.\n\nThe vehicle’s front end sports a weight-saving, frameless BMW kidney grille with a stripped-back feel reminiscent of racing machines. Designed especially for this model, its identifying features include red contour lines and the “M4 CS” badging on the upper of the two horizontal grille bars. Both the model badge at the front and its counterpart on the boot lid have black surfaces with a red border.\n\nEye-catching headlights add another flourish to the front end of the new BMW M4 CS. Their sculptural light icons illuminate yellow instead of white – both during the Welcome Light Animation and while low beam or high beam is switched on – and so reference successful GT racing cars. The rear lights of the BMW M4 CS make a visually powerful statement with their striking appearance during the hours of darkness. As well as generating a powerful radiance, their Laserlight technology is also marked out by intricate fibre optic bundles inside the light units, which have a “free-floating” appearance and are illuminated by a laser diode. The result is a prominent 3D effect. This technology was first seen in the BMW M4 CSL high-performance special edition produced in a limited run of 1,000 units, and now also brings an exclusive aesthetic to the BMW M4 CS.\n\nRacing flair in the cockpit: M Carbon bucket seats with exclusive design cues.\n\nExuding a puristic visual appeal, the cockpit of the BMW M4 CS focuses squarely on delivering an exhilarating driving experience, while also successfully blending its distinct racing aura with comfort features for everyday driving – thanks to high-quality materials and exclusive design elements. The standard M Alcantara steering wheel in three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim offers a perfect combination of secure grip for dynamic driving manoeuvres and impressive comfort on longer journeys.

Minjee Lee has won the 2023 BMW Ladies Championship with rounds of 64, 69, 71, and 68, finishing with a total score of 272 strokes (16 under par). The 27-year-old Australian clinched her second LPGA title of the season with a birdie on the first extra hole, edging out American Alison Lee. Lydia Ko (NZL), the defending champion, finished third at Seowon Valley Country Club, just two strokes behind.\n\n“I would like to congratulate Minjee Lee on winning the 2023 BMW Ladies Championship. She gave an impressive performance to overcome a world-class field and is the well-deserved BMW Ladies Champion,” said Sangyun Han, Director and President of BMW Group Korea. “It has been a thrilling week with many highlights and a fantastic premier at Seowon Valley Country Club. Thank you to all the tournament partners, supporters, volunteers, fans and everyone involved for contributing to this successful event.”\n\nMinjee Lee laid the foundation for her tenth LPGA Tour victory with an outstanding opening round of 64 (-8). In a field of players that could rival a major tournament, only Alison Lee could keep pace over four rounds, having even started slightly better with a 63 on Thursday. However, in playoff, the two-time major winner, Minjee Lee, once again showed greater composure. She had previously secured her first win of the season at the Kroger Queen City Championship last month in a playoff against Charley Hull from England.\n\n“Going into the back nine, the first probably five holes, I wasn't quite as nervous. I was probably a bit more excited,” said Minjee Lee. “These last few holes, I was quite excited to play, and you know, we always want to be putting ourselves in that position, in the contending position, week-in, week-out and I was lucky enough to do it this week. It's just really fun to play in those type of conditions and those situations, so I think I really had fun out there this week.”\n\nThe shot of the tournament came from Linn Grant in the final round on the 17th hole. After hitting the first shot into the water on the short Par 4, she holed out her third shot from the tee using a 3-wood. “It was a good shot, obviously way better than the first one. It just kept rolling and then it went in. It was crazy”, Grant said. “I love playing here. It's different from home and our usual venues in the USA or Europe. I really enjoyed the BMW Ladies Championship, and it was nice to finish the tournament with a good round.”\n\nGrant's third shot was somewhat of an ace, although it won't officially go down as one. No “real” hole-in-ones happened during the entire tournament, so the two full-electric Hole-in-One Awards, the BMW i5 at the 14th hole and the BMW i7 at the 16th hole, went unclaimed. Last year, it was quite the opposite – both Hole-in-One cars were won in the third round on the same day.\n\nHowever, even without an ace, the players enjoyed fully electric premium mobility throughout the tournament week, as they all enjoyed the BMW i7 shuttle service. More than 100 BMW vehicles were used to transport players, officials, and fans comfortably and safely to and from the golf course."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Australian defeats Alison Lee (USA) in a playoff +++ 60,000 spectators witness a world-class field at Seowon Valley Country Club +++ Fully electric BMW Courtesy Car fleet for players at the only LPGA tournament in Korea +++"}]}

Thank you to all the tournament partners, supporters, volunteers, fans and everyone involved for contributing to this successful event.”\n\nMinjee Lee laid the foundation for her tenth LPGA Tour victory with an outstanding opening round of 64 (-8). In a field of players that could rival a major tournament, only Alison Lee could keep pace over four rounds, having even started slightly better with a 63 on Thursday. However, in playoff, the two-time major winner, Minjee Lee, once again showed greater composure. She had previously secured her first win of the season at the Kroger Queen City Championship last month in a playoff against Charley Hull from England.\n\n“Going into the back nine, the first probably five holes, I wasn't quite as nervous. I was probably a bit more excited,” said Minjee Lee. “These last few holes, I was quite excited to play, and you know, we always want to be putting ourselves in that position, in the contending position, week-in, week-out and I was lucky enough to do it this week. It's just really fun to play in those type of conditions and those situations, so I think I really had fun out there this week.”\n\nThe shot of the tournament came from Linn Grant in the final round on the 17th hole. After hitting the first shot into the water on the short Par 4, she holed out her third shot from the tee using a 3-wood. “It was a good shot, obviously way better than the first one. It just kept rolling and then it went in. It was crazy”, Grant said. “I love playing here. It's different from home and our usual venues in the USA or Europe. I really enjoyed the BMW Ladies Championship, and it was nice to finish the tournament with a good round.”\n\nGrant's third shot was somewhat of an ace, although it won't officially go down as one. No “real” hole-in-ones happened during the entire tournament, so the two full-electric Hole-in-One Awards, the BMW i5 at the 14th hole and the BMW i7 at the 16th hole, went unclaimed. Last year, it was quite the opposite – both Hole-in-One cars were won in the third round on the same day.\n\nHowever, even without an ace, the players enjoyed fully electric premium mobility throughout the tournament week, as they all enjoyed the BMW i7 shuttle service.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nWith a length of 4,036 mm, a width of 1,744 mm and a height of 1,464 mm, the body dimensions are almost identical to those of its predecessor and underline the basic idea behind every MINI: To create as much space as possible on a small footprint. In the case of the MINI Cooper 5 Door, this means an interior that offers enough space for five passengers. Compared to the new MINI Cooper 3 Door, the wheelbase is 72 mm longer and the body 172 mm longer. All of which benefits the occupants in terms of comfort and space. Short overhangs, clear surfaces and expressive accents also give the new MINI Cooper 5 Door its unmistakable charisma. Inside, digital innovations and an immersive user experience take the MINI DNA to a new level.\n\nThe larger body version of the purist MINI Cooper also delivers the brand's hallmark driving fun and agile handling. There is a choice of two efficient petrol engines which, combined with the modern chassis and precise steering, deliver the hallmark MINI go-kart feeling.\n\nThe three-cylinder petrol engine of the MINI Cooper 5 Door C generates 115 kW/156 hp. The MINI Cooper 5 Door S is powered by a four-cylinder petrol engine with 150 kW/204 hp. Hallmark MINI steering and powerful brakes ensure a high level of driving fun, safety, and comfort. Compact dimensions, short overhangs, and a small turning circle of 11.4 metres make the MINI Cooper 5 Door a versatile model for the city.\n\nThe new MINI Cooper 5 Doorcombines charismatic MINI design with an extra portion of functionality. In the rear, the noticeably wider interior provides comfortable space for three passengers. The 60:40 folding rear seats increase the luggage compartment capacity from 275 litres to up to 925 litres.\n\nThe new MINI design style.The new MINI Cooper is characterised by \"Charismatic Simplicity\". The design language of the current MINI family presents the traditional values of the brand with a striking clarity. The authentic design language of the new models combines advanced technology with elementary principles of vehicle design and brand origins.\n\nThe exterior. Short overhangs, a small bonnet, a long wheelbase, and large wheels - the proportions of the MINI Cooper 5 Door reflect its urban character.\n\nThanks to its compact silhouette, the model is easy and comfortable to manoeuvre even in tight spaces - with plenty of room for all passengers. The new MINI Cooper 5 Door is an original MINI with a high recognition value. The visual tripartite division into a clearly designed body, a wraparound window area and a stepped roof makes it instantly recognisable.\n\nThe minimalist design of the front end with its focused expression contributes to this. The new generation also features the iconic MINI round headlights. Together with the octagonal front grille, they form the distinctive MINI face. Standard LED headlights with individually adjustable daytime running light elements enhance the striking appearance. The optional light signatures are available in three versions to emphasise the character of the vehicle. The MINI Cooper interacts with the driver using a specially orchestrated welcome and goodbye animation even before the journey begins.\n\nReduced body design for a striking look.The new MINI aesthetic continues at the rear with clear surfaces and flush-fitting taillights. The vertically aligned LED clusters are reminiscent of the classic MINI lights and, like the headlights, can be switched to different settings.\n\nThe flush-mounted design of the rear lights lends a modern and purist look to the car’s rear sculpture. It is subdivided by a striking black handle strip with distinctive model lettering. Its horizontal alignment emphasises the new MINI Cooper's broad stance.\n\nFour trims with individual equipment options.The new MINI Cooper 5 Door is available in eleven expressive body colours. For the roof, there is a choice of three contrasting colours, the car colour and the characteristic multi-tone roof with a gradual colour gradient. The different colour tones highlight different features of the car and showcase the new MINI design language in a variety of ways.\n\nThe car can be personalised with four different exterior trims. The Essential Trim, which comes as standard, emphasises the minimalist overall appearance and highlights certain functional parts such as the logo in Vibrant Silver. Starting with the Classic Trim, the roof is available in black or white, as is the Multitone roof with its unique colour gradient. The contrast with the body colour gives the MINI Cooper a particularly expressive look.\n\nIn the Favoured Trim version, the front radiator grille frame and certain design elements are finished in Vibrant Silver, further enhancing the individuality of the MINI Cooper.\n\nThe JCW Trim emphasises the sporty side of the MINI Cooper 5 Door. Exclusive design features such as the striking front and rear diffusers, radiator grille surround and high-gloss black JCW logo allude to MINI's motorsport heritage. Chili Red is available exclusively for the contrasting roof.\n\nThe tyre diameter is larger than on the outgoing model, emphasising the wide stance of the new MINI Cooper 5 Door. Aerodynamic wheel designs in 16 and 18-inch sizes offer further exterior options.\n\nThe interior.The interior of the new MINI Cooper 5 Door also features the brand's typical combination of new elements, technical innovations, and references to the brand's history.\n\nMinimalist and immersive.The design of the front end of the new MINI Cooper 5 Door is reduced to the essentials and is reminiscent of the purist design of the classic Mini. Legendary inventor Alec Issigonis designed an interior for the first model with a round instrument in the centre and the characteristic toggle switch strip below. These two elements also structure the cockpit in the MINI Cooper 5 Door. The minimalist design of the interior makes do with fewer components, which are cleverly designed and manufactured to a high standard. Behind the steering wheel, the optional, slim, combined head-up display ensures that all relevant content appears in the driver's field of vision. As a result, the dashboard on the driver’s side does not require an additional instrument panel, so it opens the view to the front.\n\nInnovative materials characterise the feel-good atmosphere in the interior of the MINI Cooper. A specially developed knitting process is used to create the versatile, easy-care structure of the textile in two-colour design made of recycled polyester. The textile surfaces extend across the curved dashboard and into the door panels. The air vents feature an especially flat design. The horizontal arrangement of the air vents ensures an even flow of air in the cockpit. The direction of the vents can be easily adjusted.\n\nThe generous space in the front seats and the clean lines give the cockpit a modern and airy look. Thanks to the panoramic glass roof, the interior is particularly bright. The seats are available in a standard version and in a JCW version. Their side panels are upholstered in high-quality fabric right down to the adjustment buttons. Three passengers can sit comfortably in the rear.\n\nHigh-resolution OLED display revolutionises user experience.Like the round instrument of the outgoing model, the new central icon with its versatile functions is the visual focal point of the interior. The central OLED display in the redesigned cockpit has been moved closer to the driver, making it easier to reach. Its high resolution sets a new standard. Thanks to the MINI Operating System 9, all vehicle functions can be controlled intuitively by touch or voice. The slim touch display has a high-quality glass edge, has grown to 240 mm in diameter and its operating logic is reminiscent of the standards familiar from smartphones.\n\nThe graphical presentation of content focuses on the essentials. Vehicle-related information is displayed at the top. The lower part of the OLED display provides direct access to the navigation, media, phone and climate control menus. The home button returns the display to its default settings.\n\nThe MINI Experience Modes.The seven MINI Experience Modes can be selected according to mood and personal preference and characterise the atmosphere in the interior.\n\nUsing the MINI Projector on the rear of the OLED display, they transform the dashboard into matching worlds of colour and pattern. The interplay of projection, ambient lighting and the MINI Interaction Unit creates a unique, immersive experience that extends into the door trim. This opens new possibilities for individualisation. In Personal Mode, for example, a personalised image can be selected as the display background via the MINI App. The dominant colours of the picture are then applied to the dashboard's textile surfaces using a digital colour picker. The ambient lighting under the dashboard and in the door mirror is also colour-coded to match these projections.\n\nEach mode has its own customised backgrounds. In Go-kart mode, for example, the display and interior are dominated by the John Cooper Works signature charcoal grey and red.\n\nThe new design of the rocker switch strip.Just like the iconic centre console, the rocker switch strip with its toggle switches is as legendary as the MINI itself - and yet it has been carefully updated time and again. In the latest version, the parking brake, gear selector, start/stop button, Experience Mode, and volume control are all at your fingertips. Practical benefit: The removal of the gear selector has freed up more space in the centre console, which now features a large open storage compartment in addition to the cup holders. Smartphones can be charged in the wireless charging area at the front of the console and are always ready to hand.\n\nFour newly designed interior trims.The new colour and material concept for the MINI Cooper 5 Door is deliberately minimalist. High-quality, environmentally friendly materials are used, such as the knitted recycled polyester surfaces on the dashboard and door trim.\n\nFour newly designed trims underline the feel-good concept. The Essential Trim includes black sport seats with patterned multi-tone fabric and a matching fabric strip on the dashboard. A new accent colour, Vibrant Silver, is used to highlight certain interior and exterior functional elements.\n\nStarting with the Classic Trim, the standard two-spoke steering wheel is replaced by a three-spoke version with a textile band at the six o'clock position. A 2D knitted fabric in grey and black on the dashboard and doors contrasts with the imitation leather seats.\n\nA two-tone houndstooth pattern on the knitted dashboard is particularly expressive. The perforated Vescin sports seats are available in two colours with traditional accent stitching.\n\nJCW Trim is a sporty interpretation of the new material concept. Combined with multi-coloured knitted fabric and black imitation leather with red stitching, the colour scheme echoes that of the dashboard and door trims.\n\nDigital services. \"Hey MINI\" - the new MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant.In the new MINI Cooper, numerous functions can be controlled using the brand’s first fully-fledged voice assistant. The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated with the greeting “Hey MINI” or else by using the push-to-talk steering wheel button. Voice-controlled interaction takes place on the circular OLED display in the form of an animation of graphic elements, typography, and an avatar. Users can choose between the visualisation of \"MINI\" - a stylised representation of a MINI - and the virtual travel partner \"Spike\". The driver can easily control navigation, telephone, entertainment, and numerous vehicle functions by voice.\n\nThe MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant continuously learns from repeated routes. Drawing on geo-based data, for example, the vehicle can learn to automatically open the window when entering a car park. This makes everyday life much more convenient.\n\nThe new MINI Operating System 9.The MINI user interface combines functional and emotional elements. The design is reduced, creating a very modern look based on new graphics. Static and dynamic elements blend naturally into the circular shape of the MINI Interaction Unit, following a clear structure. Micro animations reinforce the intuitive interaction between the driver and the central instrument, thereby underlining the digital character of the new MINI family.\n\nThe MINI Operating System 9 is an in-house development of the BMW Group. Operation is intuitive and follows standards that are familiar from the consumer electronics sector.\n\nThe home menu is located in the centre of the screen. The status bar with the menu items Navigation, Media, Telephone, All Apps and (depending on the situation) Home is located at the bottom of the screen. Favourite functions such as navigation destinations or radio stations can be stored in the tool belt for quick access. The upper part of the screen is reserved for driving-related content, such as speed and important vehicle status information. The optional head-up display presents the most important information in the driver’s line of sight.\n\nIn conjunction with the MINI Connected Package, the full MINI Navigation Package supports the driver during the journey with realistic 3D visualisation of turn situations, a display of the current traffic situation even when the route guidance system is not activated, information on parking facilities including digital payment options and much more.\n\nNew driver assistance systems make day-to-day life easier.The new Parking Assistant Plus makes the parking process even easier. Thanks to 12 ultrasonic sensors and four surround-view cameras, the vehicle can identify possible parking spaces more clearly and can even independently initiate space-restricted parking manoeuvres.\n\nWith MINI Digital Key Plus, the smartphone becomes the key and opens the car automatically. The welcome projection of the front and rear lights begins as soon as the driver is less than three metres away; the doors are unlocked when the driver is at less than one and a half metres away from the car. The digital key is transferable to different users, thereby facilitating car sharing in that it is no longer necessary to hand over a conventional vehicle key to the other person.\n\nComfortable and sporty mobility.The track width and wheelbase are generous for this vehicle segment and provide the basis for the hallmark MINI dynamic performance. The MINI Cooper 5 Door features a suspension and damping system tuned for spirited handling. This ensures a high level of everyday driving comfort, combined with the precise steering feel typical of MINI and the powerful brakes. Highly preloaded anti-roll bar mounts on the axles ensure balanced body handling during dynamic cornering. They also ensure steering precision and accuracy. The result is excellent body support combined with smooth rolling comfort. Selective tuning of the steering and all stability control systems ensures an exceptional experience in all driving situations. An adaptive suspension with frequency-selective damping system is available for particularly sporty driving. The increased tyre diameter of 625 mm gives the MINI Cooper 5 Door a greater visual presence. At the same time, driving dynamics and ride comfort are improved. In addition, the tyre width of the optionally available 17-inch and 18-inch rims is increased to 215 mm in order to emphasise the typical MINI go-kart feeling. Available rim sizes range from 16 to 18-inches.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper C 5 Door fuel consumption combined: 6.6 – 6.0 l/100 km (62 miles); CO2 emissions combined: 149 - 136 g/km according to WLTP.

The interplay of projection, ambient lighting and the MINI Interaction Unit creates a unique, immersive experience that extends into the door trim. This opens new possibilities for individualisation. In Personal Mode, for example, a personalised image can be selected as the display background via the MINI App. The dominant colours of the picture are then applied to the dashboard's textile surfaces using a digital colour picker. The ambient lighting under the dashboard and in the door mirror is also colour-coded to match these projections.\n\nEach mode has its own customised backgrounds. In Go-kart mode, for example, the display and interior are dominated by the John Cooper Works signature charcoal grey and red.\n\nThe new design of the rocker switch strip.Just like the iconic centre console, the rocker switch strip with its toggle switches is as legendary as the MINI itself - and yet it has been carefully updated time and again. In the latest version, the parking brake, gear selector, start/stop button, Experience Mode, and volume control are all at your fingertips. Practical benefit: The removal of the gear selector has freed up more space in the centre console, which now features a large open storage compartment in addition to the cup holders. Smartphones can be charged in the wireless charging area at the front of the console and are always ready to hand.\n\nFour newly designed interior trims.The new colour and material concept for the MINI Cooper 5 Door is deliberately minimalist. High-quality, environmentally friendly materials are used, such as the knitted recycled polyester surfaces on the dashboard and door trim.\n\nFour newly designed trims underline the feel-good concept. The Essential Trim includes black sport seats with patterned multi-tone fabric and a matching fabric strip on the dashboard. A new accent colour, Vibrant Silver, is used to highlight certain interior and exterior functional elements.\n\nStarting with the Classic Trim, the standard two-spoke steering wheel is replaced by a three-spoke version with a textile band at the six o'clock position. A 2D knitted fabric in grey and black on the dashboard and doors contrasts with the imitation leather seats.\n\nA two-tone houndstooth pattern on the knitted dashboard is particularly expressive. The perforated Vescin sports seats are available in two colours with traditional accent stitching.\n\nJCW Trim is a sporty interpretation of the new material concept. Combined with multi-coloured knitted fabric and black imitation leather with red stitching, the colour scheme echoes that of the dashboard and door trims.\n\nDigital services. \"Hey MINI\" - the new MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant.In the new MINI Cooper, numerous functions can be controlled using the brand’s first fully-fledged voice assistant. The MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant can be activated with the greeting “Hey MINI” or else by using the push-to-talk steering wheel button. Voice-controlled interaction takes place on the circular OLED display in the form of an animation of graphic elements, typography, and an avatar. Users can choose between the visualisation of \"MINI\" - a stylised representation of a MINI - and the virtual travel partner \"Spike\". The driver can easily control navigation, telephone, entertainment, and numerous vehicle functions by voice.\n\nThe MINI Intelligent Personal Assistant continuously learns from repeated routes. Drawing on geo-based data, for example, the vehicle can learn to automatically open the window when entering a car park. This makes everyday life much more convenient.\n\nThe new MINI Operating System 9.The MINI user interface combines functional and emotional elements. The design is reduced, creating a very modern look based on new graphics. Static and dynamic elements blend naturally into the circular shape of the MINI Interaction Unit, following a clear structure. Micro animations reinforce the intuitive interaction between the driver and the central instrument, thereby underlining the digital character of the new MINI family.\n\nThe MINI Operating System 9 is an in-house development of the BMW Group. Operation is intuitive and follows standards that are familiar from the consumer electronics sector.\n\nThe home menu is located in the centre of the screen. The status bar with the menu items Navigation, Media, Telephone, All Apps and (depending on the situation) Home is located at the bottom of the screen. Favourite functions such as navigation destinations or radio stations can be stored in the tool belt for quick access. The upper part of the screen is reserved for driving-related content, such as speed and important vehicle status information. The optional head-up display presents the most important information in the driver’s line of sight.\n\nIn conjunction with the MINI Connected Package, the full MINI Navigation Package supports the driver during the journey with realistic 3D visualisation of turn situations, a display of the current traffic situation even when the route guidance system is not activated, information on parking facilities including digital payment options and much more.\n\nNew driver assistance systems make day-to-day life easier.The new Parking Assistant Plus makes the parking process even easier. Thanks to 12 ultrasonic sensors and four surround-view cameras, the vehicle can identify possible parking spaces more clearly and can even independently initiate space-restricted parking manoeuvres.\n\nWith MINI Digital Key Plus, the smartphone becomes the key and opens the car automatically. The welcome projection of the front and rear lights begins as soon as the driver is less than three metres away; the doors are unlocked when the driver is at less than one and a half metres away from the car. The digital key is transferable to different users, thereby facilitating car sharing in that it is no longer necessary to hand over a conventional vehicle key to the other person.\n\nComfortable and sporty mobility.The track width and wheelbase are generous for this vehicle segment and provide the basis for the hallmark MINI dynamic performance. The MINI Cooper 5 Door features a suspension and damping system tuned for spirited handling. This ensures a high level of everyday driving comfort, combined with the precise steering feel typical of MINI and the powerful brakes. Highly preloaded anti-roll bar mounts on the axles ensure balanced body handling during dynamic cornering. They also ensure steering precision and accuracy. The result is excellent body support combined with smooth rolling comfort. Selective tuning of the steering and all stability control systems ensures an exceptional experience in all driving situations. An adaptive suspension with frequency-selective damping system is available for particularly sporty driving. The increased tyre diameter of 625 mm gives the MINI Cooper 5 Door a greater visual presence. At the same time, driving dynamics and ride comfort are improved. In addition, the tyre width of the optionally available 17-inch and 18-inch rims is increased to 215 mm in order to emphasise the typical MINI go-kart feeling. Available rim sizes range from 16 to 18-inches.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper C 5 Door fuel consumption combined: 6.6 – 6.0 l/100 km (62 miles); CO2 emissions combined: 149 - 136 g/km according to WLTP.

The MINI Cooper 5 Door is characterised by the brand's typical driving fun, extended space, and distinctive functionality. These make the five-seater an exceptional phenomenon in its segment, together with its unique design - a combination of tradition and modern, purist styling - and innovative assistance systems.With a length of 4,036 mm, a width of 1,744 mm and a height of 1,464 mm, the body dimensions are almost identical to those of its predecessor and underline the basic idea behind every MINI: To create as much space as possible on a small footprint. In the case of the MINI Cooper 5 Door, this means an interior that offers enough space for five passengers. Compared to the new MINI Cooper 3 Door, the wheelbase is 72 mm longer and the body 172 mm longer. All of which benefits the occupants in terms of comfort and space. Short overhangs, clear surfaces and expressive accents also give the new MINI Cooper 5 Door its unmistakable charisma. Inside, digital innovations and an immersive user experience take the MINI DNA to a new level.\n\nThe larger body version of the purist MINI Cooper also delivers the brand's hallmark driving fun and agile handling. There is a choice of two efficient petrol engines which, combined with the modern chassis and precise steering, deliver the hallmark MINI go-kart feeling.\n\nThe three-cylinder petrol engine of the MINI Cooper 5 Door C generates 115 kW/156 hp. The MINI Cooper 5 Door S is powered by a four-cylinder petrol engine with 150 kW/204 hp. Hallmark MINI steering and powerful brakes ensure a high level of driving fun, safety, and comfort. Compact dimensions, short overhangs, and a small turning circle of 11.4 metres make the MINI Cooper 5 Door a versatile model for the city.\n\nThe new MINI Cooper 5 Doorcombines charismatic MINI design with an extra portion of functionality. In the rear, the noticeably wider interior provides comfortable space for three passengers. The 60:40 folding rear seats increase the luggage compartment capacity from 275 litres to up to 925 litres.\n\nThe new MINI design style.The new MINI Cooper is characterised by \"Charismatic Simplicity\". The design language of the current MINI family presents the traditional values of the brand with a striking clarity. The authentic design language of the new models combines advanced technology with elementary principles of vehicle design and brand origins.\n\nThe exterior. Short overhangs, a small bonnet, a long wheelbase, and large wheels - the proportions of the MINI Cooper 5 Door reflect its urban character.\n\nThanks to its compact silhouette, the model is easy and comfortable to manoeuvre even in tight spaces - with plenty of room for all passengers. The new MINI Cooper 5 Door is an original MINI with a high recognition value. The visual tripartite division into a clearly designed body, a wraparound window area and a stepped roof makes it instantly recognisable.\n\nThe minimalist design of the front end with its focused expression contributes to this. The new generation also features the iconic MINI round headlights. Together with the octagonal front grille, they form the distinctive MINI face. Standard LED headlights with individually adjustable daytime running light elements enhance the striking appearance. The optional light signatures are available in three versions to emphasise the character of the vehicle. The MINI Cooper interacts with the driver using a specially orchestrated welcome and goodbye animation even before the journey begins.\n\nReduced body design for a striking look.The new MINI aesthetic continues at the rear with clear surfaces and flush-fitting taillights. The vertically aligned LED clusters are reminiscent of the classic MINI lights and, like the headlights, can be switched to different settings.\n\nThe flush-mounted design of the rear lights lends a modern and purist look to the car’s rear sculpture. It is subdivided by a striking black handle strip with distinctive model lettering. Its horizontal alignment emphasises the new MINI Cooper's broad stance.\n\nFour trims with individual equipment options.The new MINI Cooper 5 Door is available in eleven expressive body colours. For the roof, there is a choice of three contrasting colours, the car colour and the characteristic multi-tone roof with a gradual colour gradient. The different colour tones highlight different features of the car and showcase the new MINI design language in a variety of ways.\n\nThe car can be personalised with four different exterior trims. The Essential Trim, which comes as standard, emphasises the minimalist overall appearance and highlights certain functional parts such as the logo in Vibrant Silver. Starting with the Classic Trim, the roof is available in black or white, as is the Multitone roof with its unique colour gradient. The contrast with the body colour gives the MINI Cooper a particularly expressive look.\n\nIn the Favoured Trim version, the front radiator grille frame and certain design elements are finished in Vibrant Silver, further enhancing the individuality of the MINI Cooper.\n\nThe JCW Trim emphasises the sporty side of the MINI Cooper 5 Door. Exclusive design features such as the striking front and rear diffusers, radiator grille surround and high-gloss black JCW logo allude to MINI's motorsport heritage. Chili Red is available exclusively for the contrasting roof.\n\nThe tyre diameter is larger than on the outgoing model, emphasising the wide stance of the new MINI Cooper 5 Door. Aerodynamic wheel designs in 16 and 18-inch sizes offer further exterior options.\n\nThe interior.The interior of the new MINI Cooper 5 Door also features the brand's typical combination of new elements, technical innovations, and references to the brand's history.\n\nMinimalist and immersive.The design of the front end of the new MINI Cooper 5 Door is reduced to the essentials and is reminiscent of the purist design of the classic Mini. Legendary inventor Alec Issigonis designed an interior for the first model with a round instrument in the centre and the characteristic toggle switch strip below. These two elements also structure the cockpit in the MINI Cooper 5 Door. The minimalist design of the interior makes do with fewer components, which are cleverly designed and manufactured to a high standard. Behind the steering wheel, the optional, slim, combined head-up display ensures that all relevant content appears in the driver's field of vision. As a result, the dashboard on the driver’s side does not require an additional instrument panel, so it opens the view to the front.\n\nInnovative materials characterise the feel-good atmosphere in the interior of the MINI Cooper. A specially developed knitting process is used to create the versatile, easy-care structure of the textile in two-colour design made of recycled polyester. The textile surfaces extend across the curved dashboard and into the door panels. The air vents feature an especially flat design. The horizontal arrangement of the air vents ensures an even flow of air in the cockpit. The direction of the vents can be easily adjusted.\n\nThe generous space in the front seats and the clean lines give the cockpit a modern and airy look. Thanks to the panoramic glass roof, the interior is particularly bright. The seats are available in a standard version and in a JCW version. Their side panels are upholstered in high-quality fabric right down to the adjustment buttons. Three passengers can sit comfortably in the rear.\n\nHigh-resolution OLED display revolutionises user experience.Like the round instrument of the outgoing model, the new central icon with its versatile functions is the visual focal point of the interior. The central OLED display in the redesigned cockpit has been moved closer to the driver, making it easier to reach. Its high resolution sets a new standard. Thanks to the MINI Operating System 9, all vehicle functions can be controlled intuitively by touch or voice. The slim touch display has a high-quality glass edge, has grown to 240 mm in diameter and its operating logic is reminiscent of the standards familiar from smartphones.\n\nThe graphical presentation of content focuses on the essentials. Vehicle-related information is displayed at the top. The lower part of the OLED display provides direct access to the navigation, media, phone and climate control menus. The home button returns the display to its default settings.\n\nThe MINI Experience Modes.The seven MINI Experience Modes can be selected according to mood and personal preference and characterise the atmosphere in the interior.\n\nUsing the MINI Projector on the rear of the OLED display, they transform the dashboard into matching worlds of colour and pattern.

The optional head-up display presents the most important information in the driver’s line of sight.\n\nIn conjunction with the MINI Connected Package, the full MINI Navigation Package supports the driver during the journey with realistic 3D visualisation of turn situations, a display of the current traffic situation even when the route guidance system is not activated, information on parking facilities including digital payment options and much more.\n\nNew driver assistance systems make day-to-day life easier.The new Parking Assistant Plus makes the parking process even easier. Thanks to 12 ultrasonic sensors and four surround-view cameras, the vehicle can identify possible parking spaces more clearly and can even independently initiate space-restricted parking manoeuvres.\n\nWith MINI Digital Key Plus, the smartphone becomes the key and opens the car automatically. The welcome projection of the front and rear lights begins as soon as the driver is less than three metres away; the doors are unlocked when the driver is at less than one and a half metres away from the car. The digital key is transferable to different users, thereby facilitating car sharing in that it is no longer necessary to hand over a conventional vehicle key to the other person.\n\nComfortable and sporty mobility.The track width and wheelbase are generous for this vehicle segment and provide the basis for the hallmark MINI dynamic performance. The MINI Cooper 5 Door features a suspension and damping system tuned for spirited handling. This ensures a high level of everyday driving comfort, combined with the precise steering feel typical of MINI and the powerful brakes. Highly preloaded anti-roll bar mounts on the axles ensure balanced body handling during dynamic cornering. They also ensure steering precision and accuracy. The result is excellent body support combined with smooth rolling comfort. Selective tuning of the steering and all stability control systems ensures an exceptional experience in all driving situations. An adaptive suspension with frequency-selective damping system is available for particularly sporty driving. The increased tyre diameter of 625 mm gives the MINI Cooper 5 Door a greater visual presence. At the same time, driving dynamics and ride comfort are improved. In addition, the tyre width of the optionally available 17-inch and 18-inch rims is increased to 215 mm in order to emphasise the typical MINI go-kart feeling. Available rim sizes range from 16 to 18-inches.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper C 5 Door fuel consumption combined: 6.6 – 6.0 l/100 km (62 miles); CO2 emissions combined: 149 - 136 g/km according to WLTP. MINI Cooper S 5 Door fuel consumption combined: 6.8 – 6.3 l/100 km (62 miles); CO2 emissions combined: 153 - 141 g/km according to WLTP."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

For the first time, chassis and drive component production in Plant 02.10 at the BMW Group site in Dingolfing is operating an electrically heated ring hearth furnace. Compared with its conventional gas-powered equivalent, the latest electric furnace currently saves some 300 tonnes of CO2 a year.\n\n“The new furnace has a planned service life of over 40 years, so it’s a future-focused piece of equipment that sets the course for our journey to net zero,” said Marc Sielemann, responsible for quality and production of powertrains, chassis and brakes with Purchasing, and director of the Dingolfing component plant 02.10. The BMW Group has set itself the target of being climate neutral along the entire value chain by 2050 at the latest.\n\nWith its innovative power-to-heat technology, the hardening furnace came at an investment of approx. €7 million.\n\nNew hardening furnace for e-drive components\n\nPlant 02.10 in Dingolfing produces chassis and drive components for BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles. To make them more hard-wearing, the parts are hardened in special furnaces. As electric mobility ramps up, more and more components are being manufactured, including for electric drives. Existing systems are gradually reaching the limits of their capacity, so a new ring hearth furnace with a fixture hardening press was needed.\n\nUsed to harden gear wheels for electric transmissions, the innovative system has production capacity of approx. 960,000 spur gears a year. What’s special about it is that unlike the two existing furnaces, which are powered by gas, a fossil fuel, this new solution is for the first time powered by electricity. Rather than using 33 gas flames in ceramic-jacketed pipes, as the older model does, the new furnace uses the same number of electric heating elements to heat up to 900 degrees Celsius.\n\nElectric heat generation – or power-to-heat technology, as it is called – saves vast amounts of greenhouse gases, which are harmful to the climate. By running on electricity, the new hardening oven emits approx. 300 tonnes less CO2 a year than its gas-powered equivalent.\n\n“Energy-intensive power-to-heat systems like this new electric ring hearth furnace support the decarbonisation of heat generation – an essential aspect of climate protection. They generate heat by climate-friendly means and can be powered among other things with excess energy from renewables,” said Sielemann. So, the new power-to-heat furnace not only reduces gas consumption at Plant Dingolfing but also supports the integration of renewable energies into the electricity grid. It is another component in BMW Group Plant Dingolfing’s transformation to a sustainable BMW iFACTORY. “For the future,” said Sielemann, “we are looking into converting the remaining hardening furnaces to electricity as well.”\n\nCaptionImage 01: The new electrically powered hardening furnace in the BMW Group’s component plant 02.10 in Dingolfing.\n\nJulian Friedrich, BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, Head of Corp.

A year later, he triumphed in the GTLM class at the US endurance classic and also became IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup champion together with John Edwards (USA) at the end of the season. In 2024, Krohn joined the BMW M Motorsport Hypercar programme and contested the entire IMSA season in the BMW M Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team RLL. He won the \"Battle on the Bricks\" in Indianapolis (USA) together with Philipp Eng (AUT).\n\nThe 2025 season brought Krohn another milestone in his career – his first overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. He also won the 3-hour race of the GT World Challenge Europe on the Grand Prix circuit in the Eifel. After twelve years, Krohn is one of the longest-serving members of the BMW M Motorsport family.\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"I would like to thank Jesse Krohn very much for the past twelve years at BMW M Motorsport. During the time we worked together, I got to know him as a very reliable racing driver who always gave his all for his job. This professional attitude has led him to great successes – be it with the BMW M8 GTE at Daytona, with the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Indianapolis or most recently with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Nürburgring. It is impressive to see how incredibly far he has come from being a junior driver. Jesse Krohn's career at BMW M Motorsport is a prime example of successful promotion of young talent. He and everyone involved can be very proud of this. Jesse will now be taking on new challenges. I wish him all the best for this!\"\n\nJesse Krohn: \"It has been a long, successful time at BMW M Motorsport and I am very grateful for all the opportunities it has given me. BMW M Motorsport has given me the chance to become a professional racing driver and I have had the privilege of being part of most of BMW M Motorsport's top racing programmes after winning the Junior Programme in 2014. I have competed in over 200 races around the world with great teams and team-mates and have had many successes along the way. All good things come to an end, but new and exciting challenges await me. I would like to thank all the teams, team-mates and all the BMW M Motorsport staff I have had the pleasure of working with over the past twelve years. I wish everyone all the best for the future and every success for 2026. I will miss you, but we will meet again on the race track in the future.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Victory for BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER)! In front of a record crowd in the \"Green Hell\", Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) crowned an outstanding comeback with BMW's 21st overall victory at the endurance classic on the Nordschleife. Additionally, the new BMW M2 Racing impressed as in its final endurance test, the new entry-level race car – fielded by Team FK Performance Motorsport – celebrated a class victory.\n\nROWE Racing had a challenging start to the weekend in the Eifel region. After the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO missed out on the top qualifying session, the BMW M works driver quartet started the race from 17th position. However, under perfect weather conditions, Farfus made a dream start, moving into the top ten within the first lap. After an hour and a half, a power outage in the paddock caused a red flag. Following a 2-hour and 15-minute interruption, van der Linde stormed through the field during the restart, advancing the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from ninth to third in just two laps.\n\nSubsequently, Marciello and Krohn solidified their positions in the podium ranks, with ROWE Racing navigating the night flawlessly and steadily in second place, building a comfortable gap to the cars behind. As the sun rose over the Nordschleife, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO closed a gap of over two minutes to the leader. By the morning, the race turned into a true thriller in the \"Green Hell\". Three and a half hours before the finish, Farfus claimed the lead for ROWE Racing for the first time.\n\nAfter a penalty was issued to the competing #911 Porsche, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO was firmly on course for victory, which van der Linde secured after 24 hours. Although he crossed the finish line behind the Porsche, the Manthey EMA team's appeal against the penalty was dismissed, ensuring ROWE Racing's victory. For van der Linde, this marked his third triumph at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring after wins in 2017 and 2022 – his first with BMW M Motorsport. Alongside Farfus and his brother Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), the 29-year-old had also won the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge at Bathurst, Australia. That series includes the 24h Nürburgring as well as the upcoming 24h Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) next weekend.\n\nFor Farfus, it was his second victory on the Nordschleife after a 15-year wait, while Marciello celebrated his first 24h-race win for BMW M Motorsport in front of a record crowd of 280,000 spectators. For Krohn, it was also his first victory at the 24h Nürburgring. BMW, the record champions at the Nürburgring, last triumphed five years ago. In 2020, the BMW M6 GT3, also fielded by ROWE Racing, claimed victory.\n\nImpressive class victory for the BMW M2 Racing. The new BMW M2 Racing also delivered an outstanding performance. BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER), Charles Weerts, and Ugo de Wilde (BEL), along with motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER), were unbeatable in the SP 3T class with the #310 car. It marked a perfect final endurance test before the sales phase begins for the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car.\n\nIn total, BMW M Motorsport customer teams achieved seven class victories at the 24h Nürburgring. The #67 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from AV Racing by Black Falcon triumphed in the SP10 class. Additional successes included the #650 BMW M240i Racing from Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels in the BMW M240i class, the #500 BMW 330i from the same team in the VT2 rear-wheel-drive class, the #700 BMW 325i from rent2Drive-racing in its respective class, and the #277 BMW 318ti from RAVENOL Motorsport by MDM Racing in the SP3 class.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"I am absolutely thrilled for ROWE Racing and the drivers on this 21st overall victory for BMW at the 24h Nürburgring. This time, we could only compete with one car in the top class, but as we’ve seen, when the team and drivers deliver a perfect performance, the 'Green Hell' can be forgiving. In recent years, it hasn’t always been on our side, but this time, after 2020, we finally managed to secure another victory. Congratulations to everyone involved! The race of our new BMW M2 Racing was also sensational, achieving an impressive class victory right out of the gate. What an outstanding performance by the team and drivers!\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"What an incredible 24-hour race! Although we only competed with one car, we had a fantastic team and amazing drivers. ROWE Racing, along with Augusto Farfus, Jesse Krohn, Raffaele Marciello, and Kelvin van der Linde, delivered an absolutely flawless and perfect performance. Congratulations and a big thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport who worked so hard for this success. The performance of our new family member, the BMW M2 Racing, was also inspiring, with Ugo de Wilde, Jens Klingmann, Charles Weerts, and Michael Bräutigam celebrating a class victory. Congratulations to the FK Performance Motorsport team and to all teams and drivers who celebrated class wins and podiums in their BMW vehicles today! I am very proud!\"\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal, ROWE Racing): \"I am incredibly happy and proud of my team and drivers. I still can’t quite believe it. The race was exciting on so many levels. If someone had told me on Thursday that we’d be standing here as winners on Sunday, I wouldn’t have believed them. At that point, we were dealing with completely different problems. To work through those and hold our ground in such a tough and hot race was a fantastic achievement by everyone. This success is good for everyone and hopefully a good omen for the race at Spa-Francorchamps next week.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I had the privilege of driving the formation lap and seeing all these fans. This place is magical. We are blessed to be part of this show and to race in front of these people. I celebrated my first major victory for BMW M Motorsport here 15 years ago, and to stand here again is something special – and with the only BMW M4 GT3 EVO. We came here with just one car, but in the end, we represented BMW in the best possible way. Our goal was to finish the race, and in the end, we did so as winners. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing for the trust. Bringing this trophy home is also a big reward for the people in Munich.\"\n\nJesse Krohn (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am just grateful: grateful to BMW M Motorsport, ROWE Racing, my teammates, and the fans. This is such a special day. I’ve been coming here for over ten years, and finally, everything came together. There are moments when you feel like it will never happen, but now we’ve done it. You just need the right people around you, and we had that today. I’m just thankful to be here and to experience this moment.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am very happy. The 24 Hours of Nürburgring is one of the races I’ve always wanted to win. I’m glad that this dream has finally come true. Among the three 24-hour races this June, this was my main goal. Achieving this victory makes me incredibly proud. My teammates did a fantastic job. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing.\"\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"It’s always a privilege. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing for the trust. It was an extreme race. The entire team worked flawlessly. Everyone was at their limit: the car, us, and the tyres at the end. It was one of the toughest 24-hour races I’ve experienced here, and I am very, very proud.\"\n\nUgo de Wilde (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"It was a fantastic weekend for me: my first 24 hours on the Nordschleife. The main goal was to gain experience and show that the car is reliable. We achieved that. The car was very good, very reliable, very consistent, and it was fun to drive. It was a fantastic experience to drive at night and to spend these days with the great team and my amazing teammates. We had a great atmosphere, and it was a joy to work with them. Huge congratulations to BMW M Motorsport, ROWE Racing, and all the drivers – especially my GT World Challenge teammate Kelvin – on the overall victory.\"\n\nJens Klingmann (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"We are super happy. We completed the 24h Nürburgring, the dress rehearsal, the ultimate endurance test, without any issues. That makes us very proud and confident that we can deliver a proven race car that also has strong performance. With P36 in the overall standings and the class victory, we’ve clearly demonstrated that. We are incredibly happy; the car ran flawlessly and looks the same after the final lap as it did after the first. And of course, we are very happy about the overall victory for BMW M Motorsport and that the trophy is heading back to Munich.\"\n\nCharles Weerts (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"It was a very good race for both the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M2 Racing. The car performed very well. Our primary goal was to finish the race – and then to be as successful as possible. And we achieved that. Michael, Ugo, Jens, and the entire team did a fantastic job. It’s great to see that the project worked so well. If the car survives the 24 hours at the Nürburgring, it’s a very successful test for the car. I’m very happy for BMW M Motorsport, and of course, congratulations to ROWE Racing on the overall victory with the #98.\"\n\nMichael Bräutigam (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"My weekend was filled with many emotions. First and foremost, I was incredibly proud to even be part of this project and to drive and get to know a car that no one outside the BMW family had seen before. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport for that! Since I’m from the Eifel, this race – especially in front of a record crowd – is an absolute highlight for me.

I’m just thankful to be here and to experience this moment.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am very happy.

Victory for BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER)! In front of a record crowd in the \"Green Hell\", Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) crowned an outstanding comeback with BMW's 21st overall victory at the endurance classic on the Nordschleife. Additionally, the new BMW M2 Racing impressed as in its final endurance test, the new entry-level race car – fielded by Team FK Performance Motorsport – celebrated a class victory.\n\nROWE Racing had a challenging start to the weekend in the Eifel region. After the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO missed out on the top qualifying session, the BMW M works driver quartet started the race from 17th position. However, under perfect weather conditions, Farfus made a dream start, moving into the top ten within the first lap. After an hour and a half, a power outage in the paddock caused a red flag. Following a 2-hour and 15-minute interruption, van der Linde stormed through the field during the restart, advancing the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from ninth to third in just two laps.\n\nSubsequently, Marciello and Krohn solidified their positions in the podium ranks, with ROWE Racing navigating the night flawlessly and steadily in second place, building a comfortable gap to the cars behind. As the sun rose over the Nordschleife, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO closed a gap of over two minutes to the leader. By the morning, the race turned into a true thriller in the \"Green Hell\". Three and a half hours before the finish, Farfus claimed the lead for ROWE Racing for the first time.\n\nAfter a penalty was issued to the competing #911 Porsche, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO was firmly on course for victory, which van der Linde secured after 24 hours. Although he crossed the finish line behind the Porsche, the Manthey EMA team's appeal against the penalty was dismissed, ensuring ROWE Racing's victory. For van der Linde, this marked his third triumph at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring after wins in 2017 and 2022 – his first with BMW M Motorsport. Alongside Farfus and his brother Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), the 29-year-old had also won the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge at Bathurst, Australia. That series includes the 24h Nürburgring as well as the upcoming 24h Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) next weekend.\n\nFor Farfus, it was his second victory on the Nordschleife after a 15-year wait, while Marciello celebrated his first 24h-race win for BMW M Motorsport in front of a record crowd of 280,000 spectators. For Krohn, it was also his first victory at the 24h Nürburgring. BMW, the record champions at the Nürburgring, last triumphed five years ago. In 2020, the BMW M6 GT3, also fielded by ROWE Racing, claimed victory.\n\nImpressive class victory for the BMW M2 Racing. The new BMW M2 Racing also delivered an outstanding performance. BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER), Charles Weerts, and Ugo de Wilde (BEL), along with motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER), were unbeatable in the SP 3T class with the #310 car. It marked a perfect final endurance test before the sales phase begins for the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car.\n\nIn total, BMW M Motorsport customer teams achieved seven class victories at the 24h Nürburgring. The #67 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from AV Racing by Black Falcon triumphed in the SP10 class. Additional successes included the #650 BMW M240i Racing from Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels in the BMW M240i class, the #500 BMW 330i from the same team in the VT2 rear-wheel-drive class, the #700 BMW 325i from rent2Drive-racing in its respective class, and the #277 BMW 318ti from RAVENOL Motorsport by MDM Racing in the SP3 class.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"I am absolutely thrilled for ROWE Racing and the drivers on this 21st overall victory for BMW at the 24h Nürburgring. This time, we could only compete with one car in the top class, but as we’ve seen, when the team and drivers deliver a perfect performance, the 'Green Hell' can be forgiving. In recent years, it hasn’t always been on our side, but this time, after 2020, we finally managed to secure another victory. Congratulations to everyone involved! The race of our new BMW M2 Racing was also sensational, achieving an impressive class victory right out of the gate.

That is an excellent foundation for the upcoming races this season. A big thank you to everyone in the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team led by Werner Daemen and at BMW Motorrad Motorsport, who have contributed to this successful debut for our new endurance bike.

The newly-formed Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team enjoyed a perfect debut, claiming victory in the Superstock class.\n\nHaving endured difficult, changeable conditions during qualifying, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team began the 24-hour race from eighth place. It took just 90 minutes for the #37 BMW M 1000 RR to reach second and Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Guarnoni battled for the lead as the hours ticked by.\n\nHowever, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team had to overcome a setback in the eighth hour of the race. Mikhalchik slid as he was overtaking a slower rider and had to head for the pits with a damaged motorbike. The team gave a fantastic collective performance to repair the bike, returning Mikhalchik to the track after just seven and a half minutes. The trio on the #37 then mounted a recovery performance from seventh position.\n\nAs the race progressed, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team stood up to the harsh conditions, overcoming very cold temperatures and early morning fog to move up place by place. On Sunday morning, in the 19th hour of the race, the #37 BMW M 1000 RR was back in third and on course for the podium. Mikhalchik, Reiterberger and Guarnoni held that position to the finish line.\n\nKenny Foray (FRA), Jan Bühn (GER) and Loïc Arbel (FRA) were riding the new #9 BMW M 1000 RR for the newly-formed Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team.

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team also experienced highs and lows here at Le Mans, but never gave up and claimed a well-deserved third place on the podium. Congratulations to the riders and the team, who gave their all. We showed that we can battle for the win with our overall package. Our new BMW M 1000 RR went like clockwork in its first race, the performance was outstanding, the fastest lap shows how fast it is and there were no technical issues at all. That is an excellent foundation for the upcoming races this season. A big thank you to everyone in the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team led by Werner Daemen and at BMW Motorrad Motorsport, who have contributed to this successful debut for our new endurance bike. We are also delighted with the win for the Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Teams in the Superstock class – that was the perfect debut for this newly-formed team. Congratulations to Arnaud Sassone’s squad!”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “We are very happy. It was our goal to finish on the podium and we achieved it. Our new BMW M 1000 RR was strong, fast and reliable over the entire week, and it was great to transfer its huge potential into a podium finish. Everyone in the team did an outstanding job again. The preparation for the race and the pit-stops have been perfect. All our riders were fast and once more showed a very strong performance. Thanks to everyone in the team and at BMW Motorrad Motorsport for enabling us to start the season strongly. Now we can’t wait for our home race at Spa-Francorchamps.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger: “It's great to start the new season with a podium at Le Mans. It was a very eventful race and going home with a trophy at the end is a well-deserved reward for the hard work of the entire team. Our new BMW M 1000 RR was fast and great to ride. Starting from eighth on the grid, we fought for the lead early on in the race. The bike ran without any issues, the tyres worked well, in all the conditions that we experienced at Le Mans. We showed how strong our package is when we worked our way back up the field after the repairs, which the team completed super quickly. We have shown that also the win would have been possible if we would not have had the crash but those things can always happen in an eventful race like this. Overall, there are a lot of points that make us very confident going into the next races.”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik: “I am happy that we finished the race on the podium. I had this unlucky fall when I was approaching a slower rider in front of me. I lost the front but managed to bring the bike back to the garage. The team did an incredible job repairing the bike – a big thank you and sorry for my mistake! The team enabled us to quickly return to the track, start our catch-up and get the podium result. The new bike is really great to ride, and the fact that I set the fastest lap of the race proves its speed. We know that we can fight for the wins with it. It is a good feeling to know that we have a strong package of bike, riders and team. Now our full focus is on Spa, a race we have fond memories of.”\n\nJérémy Guarnoni: “We are really happy with that result. Third place is pretty good.

Zac Anderson (USA) produced the performance of the weekend. In both races, he drove the Auto Technic Racing #51 BMW M4 GT4 on his own, as his team-mate John Capestro-Dubets (USA) was unable to compete due to a back injury. This additional burden did not impinge upon his success, as he won Sunday’s race and reached the rostrum again on Saturday by finishing third. Kevin Boehm and Kenton Koch (both USA) finished second in both races in the Random Vandals Racing #92 BMW M4 GT4. The BimmerWorld duo James Walker Jr. / Tyler McQuarrie (both USA) secured third place overall on Sunday, which was the Pro-Am class win.

They were always in the lead after starting from pole position and Orido began the last lap with a lead of 33 seconds. Then events took a dramatic turn as the car suddenly suffered a drastic loss of speed on the approach to the final corner. The fuel tank was empty. Orido got out and started to push the BMW M4 GT4 over the finishing line as his rivals raced by. This ensured that he finished sixth, scoring vital points for himself and Kano.\n\nIn the second GT4 race on Sunday, Kano and Orido recovered from that setback in the best possible way. They were never in danger of surrendering the lead, claiming their sixth win of the season to secure the title in the Fanatec Japan Cup.

In the one-hour endurance race on Saturday, Krohn built up such a large lead in the #16 BMW M4 GT3 that even a retrospective twenty-second penalty for crossing the white line in the pit entry lane did not endanger his victory in the GT3 class.\n\nIn the second sprint race on Sunday, Krohn returned to the podium in third place.

However, he was unfortunate that a collision in the third race saw him finish 14th.\n\n“Races one and two were fantastic,” said Hill later. “The changeable conditions made the first race extremely challenging, but it was brilliant to get that win. I really had to defend hard to secure victory in race two. But it was a great battle and I did it.

In the GTD PRO, Paul Miller Racing finished in second place .\n\nFor Turner Motorsport, the class victory by BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) marked the end of a long dry spell. The team, led by team principal Will Turner, had last stood at the top of the IMSA podium in 2022 at Mid-Ohio (USA). For the BMW M4 GT3, it was the eagerly awaited first triumph of the current IMSA season. After their third podium of the season, with a second place at Long Beach (USA) and a third at Laguna Seca (USA), Foley and Gallagher are in a promising position in the GTD drivers' standings. Paul Miller Racing saw an end to a difficult time this season. The podium finish for BMW M works driver Madison Snow and Bryan Sellers (both USA) was the team's first since the third place at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) at the start of the season.\n\nBMW M Team RLL’s two BMW M Hybrid V8s did not achieve the hoped-for first podium of the season. Philipp Eng (AUT) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) missed qualifying due to an accident in practice but fought their way from the back of the GTP class field to seventh place in the race.

We are looking forward to making this a successful collaboration across our motorsport programmes in IMSA and DTM.” Ananth Parameswaran, Vice President and General Manager of Champion Ignition, said: “Growing rapidly in the OE space with a commitment to engineering, technology, and customer satisfaction, Champion has become one of the world’s largest suppliers of OE spark plugs. This partnership will bring together our brand heritage in racing with our OE pedigree to enhance awareness and build excitement around Champion.”\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Unfortunately, the breakthrough we hoped for with our BMW M Hybrid V8 crews did not happen at Road America, and we were unable to translate the good approaches we showed in practice into corresponding results. That is disappointing. The #24 car managed an improvement from the very back of the GTP starting grid to seventh place after missing qualifying. We lost the sister car from a good position due to an accident. I'm glad that nothing happened to Nick Yelloly. We will continue to work hard to turn things around this season and reward ourselves with good results. Congratulations to Turner Motorsport on the class win and the first success of a BMW M Motorsport team in the current IMSA season. We were close several times and have achieved podium places with the BMW M4 GT3, but it was only now that we made it to the very top of the podium. Congratulations again to Paul Miller Racing for the second place in the GTD PRO class. I hope we can add more successes in the second half of the season.”\n\nJesse Krohn (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, 7th place): “After missing qualifying, we were obviously on the backfoot and tried a strategy that would move us forward. Unfortunately, the yellow phases came at times when we couldn't benefit from them so in the end, seventh place was the maximum, even though we could show good pace on a clear track.”\n\nNick Yelloly (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “There's not much to say about my accident. I went a bit too far on the curb on cold tyres, the underbody hit the curb, and I slid into the tyre barrier. Luckily, I wasn't hurt.”\n\nRobby Foley (#96 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place GTD class): “What a great day for the entire team! Turner Motorsport is like a second family to me, and I'm incredibly happy to be able to give them all this win. It was a constant up and down in this race, and I never knew if we had the right strategy or not. Luckily, it worked out in the end. We could have had one or two class victories earlier this season. It's all the more beautiful that it has finally worked out now. Thanks to everyone for this fantastic job today.”\n\nMadison Snow (#1 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place GTD PRO class): “We stayed strong in this turbulent race, fought until the end, did a good job in all areas, and thus kept ourselves in the leading group.

This partnership will bring together our brand heritage in racing with our OE pedigree to enhance awareness and build excitement around Champion.”\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Unfortunately, the breakthrough we hoped for with our BMW M Hybrid V8 crews did not happen at Road America, and we were unable to translate the good approaches we showed in practice into corresponding results. That is disappointing. The #24 car managed an improvement from the very back of the GTP starting grid to seventh place after missing qualifying. We lost the sister car from a good position due to an accident. I'm glad that nothing happened to Nick Yelloly. We will continue to work hard to turn things around this season and reward ourselves with good results. Congratulations to Turner Motorsport on the class win and the first success of a BMW M Motorsport team in the current IMSA season. We were close several times and have achieved podium places with the BMW M4 GT3, but it was only now that we made it to the very top of the podium. Congratulations again to Paul Miller Racing for the second place in the GTD PRO class. I hope we can add more successes in the second half of the season.”\n\nJesse Krohn (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, 7th place): “After missing qualifying, we were obviously on the backfoot and tried a strategy that would move us forward. Unfortunately, the yellow phases came at times when we couldn't benefit from them so in the end, seventh place was the maximum, even though we could show good pace on a clear track.”\n\nNick Yelloly (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “There's not much to say about my accident. I went a bit too far on the curb on cold tyres, the underbody hit the curb, and I slid into the tyre barrier. Luckily, I wasn't hurt.”\n\nRobby Foley (#96 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place GTD class): “What a great day for the entire team! Turner Motorsport is like a second family to me, and I'm incredibly happy to be able to give them all this win. It was a constant up and down in this race, and I never knew if we had the right strategy or not. Luckily, it worked out in the end. We could have had one or two class victories earlier this season. It's all the more beautiful that it has finally worked out now. Thanks to everyone for this fantastic job today.”\n\nMadison Snow (#1 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place GTD PRO class): “We stayed strong in this turbulent race, fought until the end, did a good job in all areas, and thus kept ourselves in the leading group.

BMW M Team RLL had a challenging weekend with its two BMW M Hybrid V8s. There was great celebration among the BMW M4 GT3 crews as Turner Motorsport celebrated a class victory in the GTD category. In the GTD PRO, Paul Miller Racing finished in second place .\n\nFor Turner Motorsport, the class victory by BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) marked the end of a long dry spell. The team, led by team principal Will Turner, had last stood at the top of the IMSA podium in 2022 at Mid-Ohio (USA). For the BMW M4 GT3, it was the eagerly awaited first triumph of the current IMSA season. After their third podium of the season, with a second place at Long Beach (USA) and a third at Laguna Seca (USA), Foley and Gallagher are in a promising position in the GTD drivers' standings. Paul Miller Racing saw an end to a difficult time this season. The podium finish for BMW M works driver Madison Snow and Bryan Sellers (both USA) was the team's first since the third place at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) at the start of the season.\n\nBMW M Team RLL’s two BMW M Hybrid V8s did not achieve the hoped-for first podium of the season.

Prospects are looking good for the BMW Group in Upper Palatinate: Plant Director Armin Ebner is extremely optimistic for 2024. “Since we added a night shift in autumn of last year, our daily production has already increased by about 300 vehicles, to 1,300 currently. Our total annual production for 2023 was 238,301 vehicles.” This means that, last year, nearly one in ten BMWs produced worldwide came from Regensburg.\n\n“This confirms the strong customer appeal of the compact class models built in Regensburg, the BMW X1 and the BMW X2,” underlines Ebner. The second generation of the BMW X2 went into production in Regensburg in November. The global market launch of the vehicle manufactured exclusively at BMW Group Plant Regensburg took place on 2 March. Its main markets will be China, the US and Europe.\n\nEbner anticipates a further increase in the number of vehicles produced in Regensburg in 2024. To be more precise, the plant will be able to manufacture well over 300,000 units per year, if justified by market demand. Production of electric models, in particular, is expected to increase significantly: In 2024, at least one in three BMWs leaving the BMW Group's Bavarian vehicle plants should be an electric car – and the same applies to Regensburg.\n\n“With the BMW iX1 and BMW iX2, we will continue to inspire customers around the world with fully-electric driving pleasure from Regensburg,” says Ebner. Europe is a particularly important sales market for the fully-electric BMW iX2. In its domestic market of Germany, for instance, the BMW iX1 was Germany's ninth most popular electric car, with 14,694 new vehicle registrations in 2023, according to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).\n\nHigh-voltage batteries for the electric cars built in Regensburg are produced at the Leibnizstraße site, in direct proximity to the vehicle plant. “Our location in Leibnizstraße provides valuable support for the transformation. The fact that we produced more than 100,000 high-voltage batteries here last year is evidence of the successful ramp-up of electromobility in Regensburg,” explains Ebner. To meet differences in customer demand across all regions of the world, Regensburg will also continue to build vehicles with an internal combustion engine as part of the mix on the same assembly line.\n\nCommissioning of battery testing centre in Wackersdorf from mid-2024\n\nThe Wackersdorf location is also set to become a major facilitator for electromobility: “The first deliverables from our new battery testing centre will enter into regular operation in Wackersdorf from mid-2024 onwards,” says Ebner. The new testing centre, covering an area of more than 8,000 square metres, will be integrated into the site's existing building structures. Here, high-voltage batteries and other electric powertrain components for future BMW Group models will be put through their paces in a very early phase of development – well before the start of production.\n\n600 new hires planned by end of 2024\n\nThis high level of production is also reflected in the development of employee numbers. “We already hired more than 500 new staff in 2023. For 2024, we are planning on recruiting another 600 for our production,” explains Ebner. The site is looking to hire employees in areas with skills shortages, such as maintenance and electronics. “But we will also be offsetting natural attrition caused by people leaving the plant due to age,” Ebner continued. BMW Group Plant Regensburg will recruit 120 new apprentices in the summer as well. “This will include training eight apprentices for our planned new site in Straßkirchen here in Regensburg.” The BMW Group’s core staff at its Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations in eastern Bavaria currently totals around 9,250 employees.\n\n€ 200 million investment in securing long-term future – gearing up for production of NEUE KLASSE from second half of the decade\n\nBy the end of 2024, a total of around € 200 million will be channelled into the Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations. Ebner: “The prospects for both sites look very good. This renewed investment will help us secure the long-term future of both facilities. At the same time, it is also an investment in Upper Palatinate as a location for industry.”\n\nAt the same time as building the current models, the vehicle plant in Regensburg is also preparing for production of the next model generation, which will ramp up in the second half of the decade. “With the NEUE KLASSE, the company aims to set new standards for digitalisation, electrification and circularity – and we are already gearing up for this in Regensburg. During the production break over the New Year, we completed the first major modifications, including for our vehicle assembly. Further extensive structural measures will be implemented at the turn of the year 2024/2025,” explains Ebner.\n\nExtensive resource conservation initiativesBMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf are also investing in resource conservation. Initiatives range from transport logistics to biodiversity, and from water management to new, resource-efficient production methods. “For example, at the start of the year, we converted one of our paint shop’s two base coat lines entirely to dry separation using limestone powder. The second line – due to production reasons – will be switched in August 2025.”\n\nBMW Group Plant Regensburg also invested in water-efficient practices in 2023. Refurbishing its re-cooling systems has reduced the plant's total water consumption by a fifth, saving around 53 million litres of water per year.\n\nDigitalisation in line with principles of BMW iFACTORY\n\nAs it implements the BMW iFACTORY, the BMW Group is also focused on digitalising the Regensburg plant site to create a digital and intelligent connected factory. “We are following a holistic approach that brings together people, processes and systems. Digitalisation optimises processes and helps our employees do their jobs – because people will continue to be the backbone of our production,” says Ebner.\n\nFor example, BMW Group Plant Regensburg is the automotive industry's first plant worldwide to use an end-to-end digitalised and automated process for inspection, processing and marking of painted vehicle surfaces in standard production that relies on robots controlled by AI (artificial intelligence).\n\n“My aim is for us to be a pioneer, shaping change together with our outstanding plant team, so we can defend our leading global position – and so mobility ‘made in Upper Palatinate’ can continue to inspire people all over the world in the future,” sums up Ebner.\n\nMedia website: \n\nBMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf\n\nThe BMW Group has viewed itself for decades as the benchmark for production technology and operational excellence in vehicle construction – including at its locations in Regensburg and Wackersdorf. The BMW Group vehicle plant in Regensburg has been in operation since 1986 and is one of more than 30 BMW Group production locations worldwide. A total of up to 1,300 vehicles of the BMW X1 and BMW X2 models come off the production line at Plant Regensburg every workday – destined for customers all over the world.

Digitalisation optimises processes and helps our employees do their jobs – because people will continue to be the backbone of our production,” says Ebner.\n\nFor example, BMW Group Plant Regensburg is the automotive industry's first plant worldwide to use an end-to-end digitalised and automated process for inspection, processing and marking of painted vehicle surfaces in standard production that relies on robots controlled by AI (artificial intelligence).\n\n“My aim is for us to be a pioneer, shaping change together with our outstanding plant team, so we can defend our leading global position – and so mobility ‘made in Upper Palatinate’ can continue to inspire people all over the world in the future,” sums up Ebner.\n\nMedia website: \n\nBMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf\n\nThe BMW Group has viewed itself for decades as the benchmark for production technology and operational excellence in vehicle construction – including at its locations in Regensburg and Wackersdorf.

Prospects are looking good for the BMW Group in Upper Palatinate: Plant Director Armin Ebner is extremely optimistic for 2024. “Since we added a night shift in autumn of last year, our daily production has already increased by about 300 vehicles, to 1,300 currently. Our total annual production for 2023 was 238,301 vehicles.” This means that, last year, nearly one in ten BMWs produced worldwide came from Regensburg.\n\n“This confirms the strong customer appeal of the compact class models built in Regensburg, the BMW X1 and the BMW X2,” underlines Ebner. The second generation of the BMW X2 went into production in Regensburg in November. The global market launch of the vehicle manufactured exclusively at BMW Group Plant Regensburg took place on 2 March. Its main markets will be China, the US and Europe.\n\nEbner anticipates a further increase in the number of vehicles produced in Regensburg in 2024. To be more precise, the plant will be able to manufacture well over 300,000 units per year, if justified by market demand. Production of electric models, in particular, is expected to increase significantly: In 2024, at least one in three BMWs leaving the BMW Group's Bavarian vehicle plants should be an electric car – and the same applies to Regensburg.\n\n“With the BMW iX1 and BMW iX2, we will continue to inspire customers around the world with fully-electric driving pleasure from Regensburg,” says Ebner. Europe is a particularly important sales market for the fully-electric BMW iX2. In its domestic market of Germany, for instance, the BMW iX1 was Germany's ninth most popular electric car, with 14,694 new vehicle registrations in 2023, according to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).\n\nHigh-voltage batteries for the electric cars built in Regensburg are produced at the Leibnizstraße site, in direct proximity to the vehicle plant. “Our location in Leibnizstraße provides valuable support for the transformation. The fact that we produced more than 100,000 high-voltage batteries here last year is evidence of the successful ramp-up of electromobility in Regensburg,” explains Ebner. To meet differences in customer demand across all regions of the world, Regensburg will also continue to build vehicles with an internal combustion engine as part of the mix on the same assembly line.\n\nCommissioning of battery testing centre in Wackersdorf from mid-2024\n\nThe Wackersdorf location is also set to become a major facilitator for electromobility: “The first deliverables from our new battery testing centre will enter into regular operation in Wackersdorf from mid-2024 onwards,” says Ebner. The new testing centre, covering an area of more than 8,000 square metres, will be integrated into the site's existing building structures. Here, high-voltage batteries and other electric powertrain components for future BMW Group models will be put through their paces in a very early phase of development – well before the start of production.\n\n600 new hires planned by end of 2024\n\nThis high level of production is also reflected in the development of employee numbers. “We already hired more than 500 new staff in 2023. For 2024, we are planning on recruiting another 600 for our production,” explains Ebner. The site is looking to hire employees in areas with skills shortages, such as maintenance and electronics. “But we will also be offsetting natural attrition caused by people leaving the plant due to age,” Ebner continued. BMW Group Plant Regensburg will recruit 120 new apprentices in the summer as well. “This will include training eight apprentices for our planned new site in Straßkirchen here in Regensburg.” The BMW Group’s core staff at its Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations in eastern Bavaria currently totals around 9,250 employees.\n\n€ 200 million investment in securing long-term future – gearing up for production of NEUE KLASSE from second half of the decade\n\nBy the end of 2024, a total of around € 200 million will be channelled into the Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations. Ebner: “The prospects for both sites look very good. This renewed investment will help us secure the long-term future of both facilities. At the same time, it is also an investment in Upper Palatinate as a location for industry.”\n\nAt the same time as building the current models, the vehicle plant in Regensburg is also preparing for production of the next model generation, which will ramp up in the second half of the decade. “With the NEUE KLASSE, the company aims to set new standards for digitalisation, electrification and circularity – and we are already gearing up for this in Regensburg. During the production break over the New Year, we completed the first major modifications, including for our vehicle assembly. Further extensive structural measures will be implemented at the turn of the year 2024/2025,” explains Ebner.\n\nExtensive resource conservation initiativesBMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf are also investing in resource conservation. Initiatives range from transport logistics to biodiversity, and from water management to new, resource-efficient production methods. “For example, at the start of the year, we converted one of our paint shop’s two base coat lines entirely to dry separation using limestone powder. The second line – due to production reasons – will be switched in August 2025.”\n\nBMW Group Plant Regensburg also invested in water-efficient practices in 2023.

The second race weekend of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Barcelona (ESP) turned into a success story for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Following the pole position and the celebrated first joint victory on Saturday, Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK had plenty to cheer about on Sunday as well. Razgatlioglu claimed his next victory in the extremely exciting Superpole Race in the morning and followed it up with a third-place finish on the podium in the second main race. Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) returned to the front group with a fourth-place finish. The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team secured another top ten finish with Garrett Gerloff (USA).\n\nThe Superpole Race on Sunday morning kept everyone on the edge of their seats. Starting from pole position, Razgatlioglu initially dropped to fifth place. In the fourth of ten laps, he moved up to fourth place, and in the following lap, he made a sensational manoeuvre to regain the lead. He then battled with Andrea Iannone (ITA / Ducati) and Alvaro Bautista (ESP / Ducati) with several lead changes for the victory. In the last corner, Razgatlioglu once again executed an impressive manoeuvre and clinched his second victory of the weekend.\n\nRazgatlioglu also started the second main race on Sunday afternoon from pole position. After the start, he was briefly in fourth place, but it didn’t take long for him to work his way into the podium positions. He stayed close behind the leading Ducati riders Bautista and Nicolò Bulega (ITA) for a long time, but this time it wasn’t enough for a final sprint back to the very top. Thus, Razgatlioglu concluded his extremely successful Barcelona weekend with a third-place finish on the podium. After the finish, he embraced teammate van der Mark, who completed the strong team result in fourth place. In the Superpole Race, van der Mark finished sixth.\n\nThe Bonovo action BMW Racing Team returned to the top ten on Sunday. Both riders, Gerloff and Scott Redding (GBR), engaged in a long duel with several position changes. In the end, Gerloff prevailed in tenth place, with Redding following just 0.4 seconds behind in eleventh place.\n\nThe third round of the 2024 WorldSBK season will be held from 19th to 21st April at Assen (NED).\n\nReactions after race two at Barcelona.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Before we came here, we hoped to claim another podium. That was the target after a good test last week but we also saw that the Ducatis were extremely strong. To come away four trophies, pole position, two wins and one podium, is absolutely magnificent. I am speechless, honestly. It is extremely good for the project and I am even looking further forward to the rest of the season which gives me more confidence. Not just Toprak, also Mickey did a fantastic job, with fourth in qualifying yesterday, sixth in this morning’s Superpole Race and a very strong fourth position in main race two. It’s well deserved. I just enjoy the moment right now. It is highly emotional, this weekend had only ups. We’ve had enough downs in the past years so it’s good to get through the valley of tears. On the Bonovo side, the weekend was more difficult but in the final race, Garrett and Scott were in the ball park so we can build from there and like I said, there are better races to come. Overall, this weekend leaves me overwhelmed and very pleased.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP Race: 1 / R02: 3): “I am really happy for this moment because this is a dream. Not only for me, for BMW and the team. We claimed two victories at Barcelona, and for me it has been an amazing weekend. Especially today’s last race was a very hard, the pace was really strong. Alvaro started normal and then pushed very hard. I just tried to follow him but I felt a lot of spinning and closed the gas because in a 20-lap race you need a good tyre with good grid for the last five laps. But in general, I am very happy because we were on the podium in all three races, including two wins. Especially the Superpole Race was incredible, when I passed Alvaro in the last corner. I think this is in my top three overtakes of my career. I am also very happy for BMW. We are coming step by step and I think we will be stronger on the other race tracks. Everyone is very happy and will now work even harder. We have a very good package. We are coming, we are not so far and this year I think we can get many wins and I hope that we will be World Champions. I hope!”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP Race: 6 / R02: 4): “Honestly I think for the whole team it has been a fantastic weekend. This was one of our worst tracks and to see Toprak getting two wins, another podium and the pole position, was great, and I had some really strong results this weekend, too. So I am really happy, really satisfied with the improvement on the bikes. Honestly, to finish P6 this morning was quite good, but to finish fourth in race two was a big relief for me. It’s nice to see that I get back on a really good level and I’m just really happy with the whole weekend. I think it gives the whole team a big boost, and also for me, for the next race at Assen which I am really looking forward to. At least now we arrive there knowing how good the package can be.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP Race: 17 / R02: 10): “So we are at the end of the weekend. I am not going to lie, I was hoping and expecting a better weekend than it was. We just struggled a bit with some things. I feel like I struggle with some riding stuff on my side and also I had some issues with some setting stuff on the bike side. It wasn’t easy, there weren’t clear answers and I am kind of leaving the weekend thinking that we don’t have a clear answer of what we were missing. We were just missing something that’s not small. We just try to regroup over the next weeks and come back to Assen and have a strong race there.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP Race: 12 / R02: 11): “The weather today was unexpected. We had some rain this morning so we did not ride in the warm up. The Superpole Race was quite good for me. I felt pretty good so I managed to gain some confidence for race two. There, I was really motivated to finish in the top ten. That was my goal. I came off the start, I came together with Dominique Aegerter so I lost some positions. Then in turn three, Iker Lecouna just ran me off the track, so I lost again some positions and then we kind of settled; the group was trying to save the tyres. Then there was a big crash in turn one. I am happy that they both walked away okay from it. There was a gap I had to try to close and I used my tyre more. I felt good on the bike, that was the main thing. I felt that I could actually push the bike and start to race and have confidence. On the last few laps, the tyre dropped more. I finished 11th in the end; the top ten was there.

The second race weekend of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Barcelona (ESP) turned into a success story for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Following the pole position and the celebrated first joint victory on Saturday, Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK had plenty to cheer about on Sunday as well. Razgatlioglu claimed his next victory in the extremely exciting Superpole Race in the morning and followed it up with a third-place finish on the podium in the second main race. Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) returned to the front group with a fourth-place finish. The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team secured another top ten finish with Garrett Gerloff (USA).\n\nThe Superpole Race on Sunday morning kept everyone on the edge of their seats. Starting from pole position, Razgatlioglu initially dropped to fifth place. In the fourth of ten laps, he moved up to fourth place, and in the following lap, he made a sensational manoeuvre to regain the lead. He then battled with Andrea Iannone (ITA / Ducati) and Alvaro Bautista (ESP / Ducati) with several lead changes for the victory. In the last corner, Razgatlioglu once again executed an impressive manoeuvre and clinched his second victory of the weekend.\n\nRazgatlioglu also started the second main race on Sunday afternoon from pole position. After the start, he was briefly in fourth place, but it didn’t take long for him to work his way into the podium positions. He stayed close behind the leading Ducati riders Bautista and Nicolò Bulega (ITA) for a long time, but this time it wasn’t enough for a final sprint back to the very top. Thus, Razgatlioglu concluded his extremely successful Barcelona weekend with a third-place finish on the podium. After the finish, he embraced teammate van der Mark, who completed the strong team result in fourth place. In the Superpole Race, van der Mark finished sixth.\n\nThe Bonovo action BMW Racing Team returned to the top ten on Sunday. Both riders, Gerloff and Scott Redding (GBR), engaged in a long duel with several position changes. In the end, Gerloff prevailed in tenth place, with Redding following just 0.4 seconds behind in eleventh place.\n\nThe third round of the 2024 WorldSBK season will be held from 19th to 21st April at Assen (NED).\n\nReactions after race two at Barcelona.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Before we came here, we hoped to claim another podium. That was the target after a good test last week but we also saw that the Ducatis were extremely strong. To come away four trophies, pole position, two wins and one podium, is absolutely magnificent. I am speechless, honestly. It is extremely good for the project and I am even looking further forward to the rest of the season which gives me more confidence. Not just Toprak, also Mickey did a fantastic job, with fourth in qualifying yesterday, sixth in this morning’s Superpole Race and a very strong fourth position in main race two. It’s well deserved. I just enjoy the moment right now. It is highly emotional, this weekend had only ups. We’ve had enough downs in the past years so it’s good to get through the valley of tears. On the Bonovo side, the weekend was more difficult but in the final race, Garrett and Scott were in the ball park so we can build from there and like I said, there are better races to come. Overall, this weekend leaves me overwhelmed and very pleased.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP Race: 1 / R02: 3): “I am really happy for this moment because this is a dream. Not only for me, for BMW and the team. We claimed two victories at Barcelona, and for me it has been an amazing weekend. Especially today’s last race was a very hard, the pace was really strong. Alvaro started normal and then pushed very hard. I just tried to follow him but I felt a lot of spinning and closed the gas because in a 20-lap race you need a good tyre with good grid for the last five laps. But in general, I am very happy because we were on the podium in all three races, including two wins. Especially the Superpole Race was incredible, when I passed Alvaro in the last corner. I think this is in my top three overtakes of my career. I am also very happy for BMW. We are coming step by step and I think we will be stronger on the other race tracks. Everyone is very happy and will now work even harder. We have a very good package. We are coming, we are not so far and this year I think we can get many wins and I hope that we will be World Champions. I hope!”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP Race: 6 / R02: 4): “Honestly I think for the whole team it has been a fantastic weekend. This was one of our worst tracks and to see Toprak getting two wins, another podium and the pole position, was great, and I had some really strong results this weekend, too. So I am really happy, really satisfied with the improvement on the bikes. Honestly, to finish P6 this morning was quite good, but to finish fourth in race two was a big relief for me. It’s nice to see that I get back on a really good level and I’m just really happy with the whole weekend. I think it gives the whole team a big boost, and also for me, for the next race at Assen which I am really looking forward to. At least now we arrive there knowing how good the package can be.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP Race: 17 / R02: 10): “So we are at the end of the weekend. I am not going to lie, I was hoping and expecting a better weekend than it was. We just struggled a bit with some things. I feel like I struggle with some riding stuff on my side and also I had some issues with some setting stuff on the bike side. It wasn’t easy, there weren’t clear answers and I am kind of leaving the weekend thinking that we don’t have a clear answer of what we were missing. We were just missing something that’s not small. We just try to regroup over the next weeks and come back to Assen and have a strong race there.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP Race: 12 / R02: 11): “The weather today was unexpected. We had some rain this morning so we did not ride in the warm up. The Superpole Race was quite good for me. I felt pretty good so I managed to gain some confidence for race two. There, I was really motivated to finish in the top ten. That was my goal. I came off the start, I came together with Dominique Aegerter so I lost some positions. Then in turn three, Iker Lecouna just ran me off the track, so I lost again some positions and then we kind of settled; the group was trying to save the tyres. Then there was a big crash in turn one. I am happy that they both walked away okay from it. There was a gap I had to try to close and I used my tyre more. I felt good on the bike, that was the main thing. I felt that I could actually push the bike and start to race and have confidence. On the last few laps, the tyre dropped more. I finished 11th in the end; the top ten was there. So I was happy, because Barcelona is one of the worst tracks in the calendar for me and I came away with confidence which is the first time in three years that this has happened, so I look forward to the next round.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Conclusion of an incredible weekend: Another victory and podium for Toprak Razgatlioglu and the BMW M 1000 RR on WorldSBK Sunday at Barcelona."}]}

It is set to make its first appearance at this year's 24 Hours of Nürburgring, one of the toughest endurance races in the world, challenging drivers and teams to conquer the iconic Nürburgring-Nordschleife over a grueling, day-long battle of speed, skill, and reliability.\n\nThe new petrol-powered MINI John Cooper Works, cloaked in a bespoke camouflage designed by the MINI Design Team, pays homage to the iconic red and white color schemes used for classic Minis in motorsports in the 1960s.\n\nCelebrating its world premiere in fall 2024, the New MINI John Cooper Works marks a significant milestone in MINI's commitment to innovation and heritage. In a bold move, the new MINI John Cooper Works lineup, developed to push the boundaries of speed and agility, will be available in both petrol and all-electric versions.\n\nIn a nod to Mini’s historic victory of the Mini Cooper S at the 1964 Rallye Monte Carlo 60 years ago, the racecar features a distinctive “37” logo, commemorating this milestone achievement. This emblem serves as a homage to MINI’s rich motorsport tradition.\n\nThe New MINI John Cooper Works #317 will be entered by the private racing team from Nürburg, Bulldog Racing, and will be competing in the SP 3T category.\n\nDubbed “MINI John Cooper Works PRO”, the MINI Twin-Power Turbo racecar represents the perfect fusion of MINI's iconic design and reliability and Bulldog Racing's track-tested expertise.\n\nThe second entry will be the beloved black MINI John Cooper Works #474 manual transmission, which showcased its prowess by securing a podium finish at last year's 24 Hours of Nürburgring, proving its mettle against fierce competition in the VT-2 category, cementing its status as a formidable contender in endurance racing.\n\nAs anticipation builds for its debut, MINI fans and automotive enthusiasts alike can expect an unforgettable showcase of the New MINI John Cooper Works capabilities at this year’s 24 Hours of Nürburgring from June 1st to June 2nd 2024."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The BMW Group is sharing its vision of the future digital experience, both inside and outside the vehicle, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2023 in Las Vegas. BMW i Vision Dee is the futuristic mid-size sedan with a new and pared-down design language. The name “Dee” stands for Digital Emotional Experience – and that is precisely its aim: to create an even stronger bond between people and their cars going forward. Future digital functions will go far beyond the level of voice control and driver assistance systems we are familiar with today. The BMW Head-Up-Display extends across the full width of the windscreen, providing a glimpse of the next vehicle generation. From 2025 onwards, this innovation will be available in the models of the NEUE KLASSE. The BMW Group has also refined its use of colour-change technology. Having unveiled the BMW iX Flow Featuring E Ink, with the ability to change from black to white, at the last CES, BMW i Vision Dee can now curate its exterior in up to 32 colours.\n\n“With the BMW i Vision Dee, we are showcasing what is possible when hardware and software merge. In this way, we are able to exploit the full potential of digitalisation to transform the car into an intelligent companion. That is the future for automotive manufacturers – and, also, for BMW: the fusion of the virtual experience with genuine driving pleasure,” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “At the same time, BMW i Vision Dee is another step on the road to the NEUE KLASSE. With this vision, we are looking far into the future and underlining the tremendous importance of digitalisation for our upcoming product generations.”\n\nWith its intelligent, almost human capabilities, BMW i Vision Dee accompanies drivers not only through real-life situations on the roads, but also in their digital environment.\n\n“A BMW lives by its unparalleled digital performance. BMW i Vision Dee is about perfect integration of virtual and physical experiences,” said Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Development. “Whoever excels at integrating the customer’s everyday digital worlds into the vehicle at all levels will succeed in mastering the future of car-building.” BMW Mixed Reality Slider: into the virtual world in five steps The BMW Mixed Reality Slider, in combination with the advanced Head-up Display, is the digital highlight and central operating control of BMW i Vision Dee. Using shy-tech sensors on the instrument panel, drivers can decide for themselves how much digital content they want to see on the advanced Head-Up Display. The five-step selection ranges from analogue, to driving-related information, to the contents of the communications system, to augmented-reality projection, right up to entry into virtual worlds. In parallel, dimmable windows can also be used to gradually fade out reality. Mixed reality can be experienced in BMW i Vision Dee in an immersive way that engages different senses without requiring any additional tools, creating a new dimension of driving pleasure for the user. Advanced BMW Head-Up-Display: in NEUE KLASSE from 2025 The BMW Group is known in the automotive sector as a trailblazer for the Head-Up-Display and has systematically refined this technology over the past two decades. In BMW i Vision Dee, projection across the entire width of the windscreen allows information to be displayed on the largest possible surface – which only becomes recognisable as a display once it is activated. In this way, the BMW Group demonstrates the huge potential of projection technology and BMW i Vision Dee visualises how a advanced Head-Up-Display could also be utilised in the future for the display and operating concept. The standard-production version of the BMW Head-up-Display extending across the full width of the windscreen will be used in the models of the NEUE KLASSE from 2025 onwards. Welcome scenario with voice and phygital icons The digital experience already begins outside the vehicle, with a personalised welcome scenario that combines graphical elements, light and sound effects. Natural language serves as the simplest, most intuitive form of interaction, enabling perfect understanding between humans and their vehicles. The headlights and the closed BMW kidney grille also form a common phygital (fusion of physical and digital) icon on a uniform surface, allowing the vehicle to produce different facial expressions. This means BMW i Vision Dee can talk to people and, at the same time, express moods such as joy, astonishment or approval visually. BMW i Vision Dee can also project an image of the driver’s avatar onto the side window to further personalise the welcome scenario. World premiere for full-colour E Ink technology Following the spectacular debut of the BMW iX Flow Featuring E Ink at CES 2022, the BMW Group is now unveiling a full-colour version of the E Ink technology in BMW i Vision Dee that will be used as the outer skin of the vehicle for the first time worldwide.\n\nBMW i Vision Dee, rather than simply alternating between black and white, now showcases a multi-coloured, fully variable and individually configurable exterior. An ePaper film from the BMW Group’s cooperation partner, E Ink, is applied to the body to create this magical display of colour. Up to 32 colours can be displayed.\n\nThe body surface of the BMW i Vision Dee is divided into 240 E Ink segments, each of which is controlled individually. This allows an almost infinite variety of patterns to be generated and varied within seconds. The laser cutting process used to trim the films and the electronic control design were developed in partnership with E Ink. The adaptation of this technology for curved surfaces and the programming of the animations, were developed by BMW Group’s in-house engineers – enabling a form enabling a form of customisation that is unique throughout the automotive sector worldwide. Reductive design – inside and outThe design of BMW i Vision Dee has been deliberately pared down to focus attention on the digital experience and the DNA of the BMW brand. The exterior is defined by the classic three-box sedan design that forms the core of the BMW brand. Traditional design elements, like the BMW kidney grille, twin circular headlights and the Hofmeister kink, are reimagined, with phygital icons replacing analogue elements. This gives BMW i Vision Dee its own digital, but human, character.\n\nInside, digitalisation goes hand in hand with reductive use of materials, operating controls and displays to ensure nothing distracts from the digital experience and the new feeling of enhanced driving pleasure. The unconventional design of the steering wheel, with its central vertical spoke, creates touchpoints that come to life when approached or touched and can be operated by moving the thumb. These phygital touchpoints control selection of the content projected onto the windscreen and, together with the Head-Up Display, thus support the principle of “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road”.\n\n“With BMW i Vision Dee, we are showing how the car can be seamlessly integrated into your digital life and become a trusty companion. The vehicle itself becomes your portal to the digital world – with the driver always in control,” said Adrian van Hooydonk, head of BMW Group Design. “Implemented the right way, technology will create worthwhile experiences, make you a better driver and simply bring humans and machines closer together.” Another milestone on the road to the NEUE KLASSE The future of the BMW Group is electric, circular and digital. BMW i Vision Dee represents the digital aspect of this trio and will be another milestone on the road to the next vehicle generation, the NEUE KLASSE.

It was a nerve-wracking end to a long season, but it all paid off when FC Bayern Munich Basketball successfully defended their German championship title with a hard-fought victory in the decisive fifth BBL final game against Ulm - and celebrated in front of a home crowd. But the reasons to celebrate extended beyond the court: fans witnessed a total of 125 dunks by the team during home games. Each one represents a real opportunity. As part of the “Dunks for Tomorrow” initiative, BMW Munich donates €1,000 for every dunk by the Reds. Since the beginning of the partnership in 2023, the mobility partner of the German champions has actively supported educational equity and equal opportunity.\n\nIn total, this brought in €125,000, which BMW Munich is donating to DEIN MÜNCHEN. The non-profit organization is passionately committed to improving future prospects for children and young people in the Bavarian capital. The support will go toward the “NO LIMITS!” project, which focuses on helping teenagers growing up in difficult social and financial circumstances by assisting them with their academic, professional, or personal development.\n\n“Our ‘Dunks for Tomorrow’ initiative is a core part of the partnership between BMW Munich and FC Bayern Munich Basketball - through which we take on social responsibility in our shared hometown,” said Bernd Döpke, Head of BMW Munich, during the symbolic check handover to DEIN MÜNCHEN. “We’re very pleased that an impressive 125 home-game dunks translated into a proud total of €125,000.”\n\nThe BMW Group and DEIN MÜNCHEN share the belief that the transmission of knowledge and skills, as well as fostering healthy self-esteem, are key factors for equal opportunity and social participation - and ultimately help to strengthen social cohesion.\n\n“This fantastic donation will go directly into our ‘NO LIMITS!’ education programme and thereby help build real futures for young people,” said Mara Bertling, founder and managing director of DEIN MÜNCHEN. “With ‘NO LIMITS!’, we support young people in their personal development, strengthen their self-confidence, and help them grow their talent and potential for a self-determined life. Each dunk represents not only a special sporting moment, but a real opportunity in life. This powerful partnership transforms sporting energy into social impact that benefits us all. On behalf of all the young people: thank you!”\n\nSport itself is also an important factor on this journey. In addition to the financial support, BMW Munich also donated 125 basketballs to schools and other institutions working with DEIN MÜNCHEN.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\n- Check against delivery –\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nBefore I talk about current developments, I’d like to say a few words about the change in the Board of Management of BMW AG.\n\nAs you all know, the Supervisory Board appointed Jochen Goller to the Board of Management, effective 1st of November. After various roles in China and the UK, as well as serving as head of the MINI brand, Jochen Goller has managed our activities in China very successfully since 2018.\n\nSean Green, who was previously Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing at our BBA joint venture, will be responsible for our business in China going forward.\n\nJochen Goller takes over from Pieter Nota, who led our Customer, Brands and Sales Board division from 2018.\n\nUnder Pieter Nota’s leadership, the BMW Group grew its global market share significantly. During this time, the BMW brand also regained its position at the top of the premium segment and steadily expanded it.\n\nI would like to extend my sincere thanks to Pieter Nota and wish Jochen Goller all the best as he embarks on his new role.\n\nI just got back from a trip to Asia about a week ago. I know that some of you were also able to get an idea of the current market situation over there, at the recent BMW China Days in Shenyang and Shanghai.\n\nFor me, the visit to Beijing and then the Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo clearly showed once again:\n\nThere is no “one-size-fits-all” for the mobility of today and tomorrow. Our world is multifaceted – and that’s why we need different technological solutions: On the one hand, to meet our customers’ wide-ranging needs. On the other, to comply with very different regulatory requirements in countries around the world.\n\nChina mainly relies on pure electric vehicles – although plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles also have a part to play in decarbonising mobility. In Beijing, for example, a large number of taxis already run on hydrogen.\n\nIn the third quarter of this year, we grew our business worldwide – thanks to our wide range of premium vehicles across all drive technologies.\n\nPure electric vehicles stood out in China, in particular: We more than tripled our sales there in the first nine months compared to the same period of last year.\n\nIn Japan, the current demand for all-electric cars is still relatively subdued. The focus is more on plug-in hybrids and cars with combustion engines. However, it became clear at the Japan Mobility Show that Japanese manufacturers, in particular, are starting to step things up – with their own concept cars and fully-electric options.\n\nJapan recognised the importance of hydrogen early on. This is why our BMW iX5* Hydrogen pilot vehicle has been well received there.\n\nFor a global premium manufacturer like the BMW Group, technology orientation remains the right path for decarbonising mobility.\n\nOur healthy sales and financial figures are proof of this. We will continue to pursue this path consistently in the future. In October, we presented the BMW X2 with the all-electric iX2* as the latest example of this.\n\nThe iX2 is, more than anything, a digital champion.\n\nThe new BMW Operating System 9 introduces the ideal platform for a comprehensive range of digital features and functions – such as totally new gaming and streaming capabilities.\n\nIt is features like these – such as optimised touch controls or seamlessly integrated voice control – that allow our customers to enjoy a unique digital experience in their car.\n\nEarly next year, our rollout of new all-electric products will continue: In the spring, the new BMW 5 Series Touring will celebrate its world premiere. It will be available with the same drivetrain portfolio as the Sedan, including the all-electric, i5* Touring. This gives us a real USP in a segment that is very popular – especially in Europe.\n\nOur goal remains the same: more than half our global sales from all-electric cars, well before 2030.\n\nTo this end, we are also further expanding our leading role in battery cell technology. At our competence centre in Parsdorf near Munich, we are laying the technological foundations for the efficient and resource-saving production of battery cells. And we do this along the entire value chain.\n\nWe share the know-how we develop there with our suppliers. In this way, we are setting benchmarks in production, quality, performance, costs and ecology of battery cells.\n\nLast week, we put the competence centre in Parsdorf into operation. Sample production of sixth-generation round cells has begun.\n\nThese cells are characterised by an up to 20% higher energy density. In addition, we were able to reduce the CO2 footprint in cell production by up to 60%.\n\nOur customers will benefit from up to 30% faster charging speed and up to 30% higher range according to WLTP.\n\nIn line with our \"local-for-local\" principle, the BMW Group also ensures that the next step – high-voltage battery assembly – takes place as close as possible to the vehicle plants.\n\nThis approach secures our production, even in the event of unforeseen political and economic developments. Short transport distances also reduce the carbon footprint of vehicle production.\n\nProduction facilities for the sixth generation of BMW high-voltage batteries are currently being built at all major manufacturing locations:\n\nIn Debrecen, Hungary.\n\nIn Woodruff, South Carolina, in the US.\n\nIn San Luis Potosí, Mexico.\n\nAnd in Shenyang, China.\n\nWe are planning a further assembly site for high-voltage batteries in Irlbach-Straßkirchen to supply our vehicle production in Bavaria. A clear majority voted to allow the planning process in Lower Bavaria to continue in a recent referendum. It not only secures the future of our Bavarian vehicle plants; it also sends an important signal, underlining Germany’s future viability as a location for industry.\n\nWe hope to start construction within the next year.\n\nThese high-voltage batteries will then be used in our NEUE KLASSE, which will also be produced at our main plant in Munich from 2026 onwards.\n\nWe provided a glimpse of the NEUE KLASSE at the IAA MOBILITY in early September.\n\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse shows how we are designing individual mobility to be more human, more intelligent and more responsible.\n\nFor example, the materials we are developing for the NEUE KLASSE will help reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nAn additional highlight is the Panoramic Vision Display, which uses the entire width of the windscreen and is visible to all passengers.\n\nWhat has always set BMW apart is the perfect interaction of all components – and the unmistakeable, brand-authentic driving dynamics that this enables. We are also taking this unique selling point to a whole new level, with a perfect combination of hardware and software.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is more than just another BMW-brand car. It is a whole new generation of products. We will be releasing six models onto the roads within 24 months – from SAVs to sedans. What all the models have in common is the all-electric heart that powers them.\n\nMINI will also be all-electric in the future. Between now and 2030, we will be completely realigning MINI and making the brand all-electric. We presented two key members of the new MINI family at the IAA MOBILITY: the MINI Cooper* 3-Door and the MINI Countryman*.\n\nThe next fully-electric MINI is ready to go: In April 2024, the MINI Aceman will make its world premiere in the premium-compact car segment.\n\nThe new MINI family is produced by our Chinese joint-venture partner, Spotlight, in China and in our plants in Leipzig and Oxford.\n\nOur second British brand is also on the threshold of pure electromobility. By the early 2030s, Rolls-Royce will also be exclusively all-electric. Preparations for the sales launch of the first electric Rolls-Royce are currently in full swing.\n\nThe Spectre*, which is scheduled for release by the end of the year, is set to redefine modern luxury.\n\nThere has also been a change at the top at Rolls-Royce. Torsten Müller-Ötvös – who has led Rolls-Royce since 2010 and driven the transformation and rejuvenation of this unique marque – is retiring.\n\nHe will be handing over to Chris Brownridge, from 1st of December. Chris currently heads the UK market – bringing experience, of course, but, above all, a feel for the exclusive demands of the brand and its customers.\n\nLet’s move on to BMW Motorrad. We recently celebrated the brand's centenary at the end of September with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at our plant in Berlin-Spandau.\n\nThe brand has performed exceptionally well in recent years. Its centenary celebrations were the culmination of the career of BMW Motorrad's long-standing leader: Markus Schramm – who is also retiring.\n\nUnder his leadership, BMW Motorrad steadily expanded its product range, opened new markets for the brand and saw numerous record-breaking years.\n\nMarkus Flasch took over from him on the 1st of November. Markus brings experience as head of BMW M GmbH and head of the product line for BMW mid-size and luxury class and Rolls-Royce.\n\nWhile we are constantly expanding and refining our product range, our current focus is on further digitalisation of the customer interface. Direct customer access plays a key role in this.\n\nOur new direct sales model for MINI is about to be launched in Europe. The rollout with MINI in China was already a success.\n\nThe European rollout will begin on 1st of January, with Italy, Poland and Sweden. Other European countries will follow in stages. The BMW launch will get underway in 2026.\n\nThe direct sales model will benefit everyone involved:\n\n- Our customers are guaranteed full price transparency and can move seamlessly between online and offline consulting options during the purchasing process.\n\n- At the same time, it offers our retailers an attractive business model – as shown by their positive response. All our European retailers have signed contracts to this effect.\n\n- In return, the BMW Group gains direct access to customers – which we will use to curate an entirely new customer experience.\n\nThe best example of this is our new “Proactive Care” service. It uses data analytics and AI to evaluate data from the vehicle and detect potential problems before they even occur.\n\nIf the cause can be fixed using software, this is done remotely. In all other cases, our customers receive a notification – for example, a tip for how to handle the issue themselves or, if necessary, a note asking them to contact a BMW dealer.\n\nIf the customer agrees, an appointment can easily be set up using the automated system.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn 2023, we are once again demonstrating the success of the BMW Group’s strategic approach. With our products, range of drive technologies and production sites worldwide, our position is highly diversified.\n\nA recent study also confirms this: US magazine TIME and global database Statista named the world’s top 750 companies: The BMW Group ranked in the top ten – and was the highest-rated automotive manufacturer worldwide.\n\nThe mood is also very positive inside the company – as this year’s Employee Survey confirmed. We asked our just under 150,000 employees to tell us what they think.\n\nTheir responses showed that: The BMW Group is a highly attractive employer. The workforce backs the company's goals. And: Our employees worldwide are proud to work for the BMW Group.\n\nThat is the best foundation for continuing on our successful course in the future.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption/emissions data: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 1,19 kg H2/100 km, CO2 emissions combined in WLTP cycle: 0 g/kmElectric range: 504 km (313 miles) BMW iX2 xDrive30: Electric power consumption, combined in WLTP cycle: 17.7 – 16.3 kWh/100 km, Electric power consumption, combined in NEDC cycle: – , Range: 417 – 449 km (259 – 279 miles) in WLTP cycle.

A clear majority voted to allow the planning process in Lower Bavaria to continue in a recent referendum. It not only secures the future of our Bavarian vehicle plants; it also sends an important signal, underlining Germany’s future viability as a location for industry.\n\nWe hope to start construction within the next year.\n\nThese high-voltage batteries will then be used in our NEUE KLASSE, which will also be produced at our main plant in Munich from 2026 onwards.\n\nWe provided a glimpse of the NEUE KLASSE at the IAA MOBILITY in early September.\n\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse shows how we are designing individual mobility to be more human, more intelligent and more responsible.\n\nFor example, the materials we are developing for the NEUE KLASSE will help reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nAn additional highlight is the Panoramic Vision Display, which uses the entire width of the windscreen and is visible to all passengers.\n\nWhat has always set BMW apart is the perfect interaction of all components – and the unmistakeable, brand-authentic driving dynamics that this enables. We are also taking this unique selling point to a whole new level, with a perfect combination of hardware and software.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is more than just another BMW-brand car. It is a whole new generation of products. We will be releasing six models onto the roads within 24 months – from SAVs to sedans. What all the models have in common is the all-electric heart that powers them.\n\nMINI will also be all-electric in the future. Between now and 2030, we will be completely realigning MINI and making the brand all-electric. We presented two key members of the new MINI family at the IAA MOBILITY: the MINI Cooper* 3-Door and the MINI Countryman*.\n\nThe next fully-electric MINI is ready to go: In April 2024, the MINI Aceman will make its world premiere in the premium-compact car segment.\n\nThe new MINI family is produced by our Chinese joint-venture partner, Spotlight, in China and in our plants in Leipzig and Oxford.\n\nOur second British brand is also on the threshold of pure electromobility. By the early 2030s, Rolls-Royce will also be exclusively all-electric. Preparations for the sales launch of the first electric Rolls-Royce are currently in full swing.\n\nThe Spectre*, which is scheduled for release by the end of the year, is set to redefine modern luxury.\n\nThere has also been a change at the top at Rolls-Royce. Torsten Müller-Ötvös – who has led Rolls-Royce since 2010 and driven the transformation and rejuvenation of this unique marque – is retiring.\n\nHe will be handing over to Chris Brownridge, from 1st of December. Chris currently heads the UK market – bringing experience, of course, but, above all, a feel for the exclusive demands of the brand and its customers.\n\nLet’s move on to BMW Motorrad. We recently celebrated the brand's centenary at the end of September with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at our plant in Berlin-Spandau.\n\nThe brand has performed exceptionally well in recent years. Its centenary celebrations were the culmination of the career of BMW Motorrad's long-standing leader: Markus Schramm – who is also retiring.\n\nUnder his leadership, BMW Motorrad steadily expanded its product range, opened new markets for the brand and saw numerous record-breaking years.\n\nMarkus Flasch took over from him on the 1st of November. Markus brings experience as head of BMW M GmbH and head of the product line for BMW mid-size and luxury class and Rolls-Royce.\n\nWhile we are constantly expanding and refining our product range, our current focus is on further digitalisation of the customer interface. Direct customer access plays a key role in this.\n\nOur new direct sales model for MINI is about to be launched in Europe. The rollout with MINI in China was already a success.\n\nThe European rollout will begin on 1st of January, with Italy, Poland and Sweden. Other European countries will follow in stages. The BMW launch will get underway in 2026.\n\nThe direct sales model will benefit everyone involved:\n\n- Our customers are guaranteed full price transparency and can move seamlessly between online and offline consulting options during the purchasing process.\n\n- At the same time, it offers our retailers an attractive business model – as shown by their positive response. All our European retailers have signed contracts to this effect.\n\n- In return, the BMW Group gains direct access to customers – which we will use to curate an entirely new customer experience.\n\nThe best example of this is our new “Proactive Care” service. It uses data analytics and AI to evaluate data from the vehicle and detect potential problems before they even occur.\n\nIf the cause can be fixed using software, this is done remotely. In all other cases, our customers receive a notification – for example, a tip for how to handle the issue themselves or, if necessary, a note asking them to contact a BMW dealer.\n\nIf the customer agrees, an appointment can easily be set up using the automated system.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn 2023, we are once again demonstrating the success of the BMW Group’s strategic approach. With our products, range of drive technologies and production sites worldwide, our position is highly diversified.\n\nA recent study also confirms this: US magazine TIME and global database Statista named the world’s top 750 companies: The BMW Group ranked in the top ten – and was the highest-rated automotive manufacturer worldwide.\n\nThe mood is also very positive inside the company – as this year’s Employee Survey confirmed. We asked our just under 150,000 employees to tell us what they think.\n\nTheir responses showed that: The BMW Group is a highly attractive employer. The workforce backs the company's goals. And: Our employees worldwide are proud to work for the BMW Group.\n\nThat is the best foundation for continuing on our successful course in the future.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption/emissions data: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 1,19 kg H2/100 km, CO2 emissions combined in WLTP cycle: 0 g/kmElectric range: 504 km (313 miles) BMW iX2 xDrive30: Electric power consumption, combined in WLTP cycle: 17.7 – 16.3 kWh/100 km, Electric power consumption, combined in NEDC cycle: – , Range: 417 – 449 km (259 – 279 miles) in WLTP cycle.

After various roles in China and the UK, as well as serving as head of the MINI brand, Jochen Goller has managed our activities in China very successfully since 2018.\n\nSean Green, who was previously Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing at our BBA joint venture, will be responsible for our business in China going forward.\n\nJochen Goller takes over from Pieter Nota, who led our Customer, Brands and Sales Board division from 2018.\n\nUnder Pieter Nota’s leadership, the BMW Group grew its global market share significantly. During this time, the BMW brand also regained its position at the top of the premium segment and steadily expanded it.\n\nI would like to extend my sincere thanks to Pieter Nota and wish Jochen Goller all the best as he embarks on his new role.\n\nI just got back from a trip to Asia about a week ago. I know that some of you were also able to get an idea of the current market situation over there, at the recent BMW China Days in Shenyang and Shanghai.\n\nFor me, the visit to Beijing and then the Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo clearly showed once again:\n\nThere is no “one-size-fits-all” for the mobility of today and tomorrow. Our world is multifaceted – and that’s why we need different technological solutions: On the one hand, to meet our customers’ wide-ranging needs. On the other, to comply with very different regulatory requirements in countries around the world.\n\nChina mainly relies on pure electric vehicles – although plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles also have a part to play in decarbonising mobility. In Beijing, for example, a large number of taxis already run on hydrogen.\n\nIn the third quarter of this year, we grew our business worldwide – thanks to our wide range of premium vehicles across all drive technologies.\n\nPure electric vehicles stood out in China, in particular: We more than tripled our sales there in the first nine months compared to the same period of last year.\n\nIn Japan, the current demand for all-electric cars is still relatively subdued. The focus is more on plug-in hybrids and cars with combustion engines. However, it became clear at the Japan Mobility Show that Japanese manufacturers, in particular, are starting to step things up – with their own concept cars and fully-electric options.\n\nJapan recognised the importance of hydrogen early on. This is why our BMW iX5* Hydrogen pilot vehicle has been well received there.\n\nFor a global premium manufacturer like the BMW Group, technology orientation remains the right path for decarbonising mobility.\n\nOur healthy sales and financial figures are proof of this. We will continue to pursue this path consistently in the future. In October, we presented the BMW X2 with the all-electric iX2* as the latest example of this.\n\nThe iX2 is, more than anything, a digital champion.\n\nThe new BMW Operating System 9 introduces the ideal platform for a comprehensive range of digital features and functions – such as totally new gaming and streaming capabilities.\n\nIt is features like these – such as optimised touch controls or seamlessly integrated voice control – that allow our customers to enjoy a unique digital experience in their car.\n\nEarly next year, our rollout of new all-electric products will continue: In the spring, the new BMW 5 Series Touring will celebrate its world premiere. It will be available with the same drivetrain portfolio as the Sedan, including the all-electric, i5* Touring. This gives us a real USP in a segment that is very popular – especially in Europe.\n\nOur goal remains the same: more than half our global sales from all-electric cars, well before 2030.\n\nTo this end, we are also further expanding our leading role in battery cell technology. At our competence centre in Parsdorf near Munich, we are laying the technological foundations for the efficient and resource-saving production of battery cells. And we do this along the entire value chain.\n\nWe share the know-how we develop there with our suppliers. In this way, we are setting benchmarks in production, quality, performance, costs and ecology of battery cells.\n\nLast week, we put the competence centre in Parsdorf into operation. Sample production of sixth-generation round cells has begun.\n\nThese cells are characterised by an up to 20% higher energy density. In addition, we were able to reduce the CO2 footprint in cell production by up to 60%.\n\nOur customers will benefit from up to 30% faster charging speed and up to 30% higher range according to WLTP.\n\nIn line with our \"local-for-local\" principle, the BMW Group also ensures that the next step – high-voltage battery assembly – takes place as close as possible to the vehicle plants.\n\nThis approach secures our production, even in the event of unforeseen political and economic developments. Short transport distances also reduce the carbon footprint of vehicle production.\n\nProduction facilities for the sixth generation of BMW high-voltage batteries are currently being built at all major manufacturing locations:\n\nIn Debrecen, Hungary.\n\nIn Woodruff, South Carolina, in the US.\n\nIn San Luis Potosí, Mexico.\n\nAnd in Shenyang, China.\n\nWe are planning a further assembly site for high-voltage batteries in Irlbach-Straßkirchen to supply our vehicle production in Bavaria. A clear majority voted to allow the planning process in Lower Bavaria to continue in a recent referendum. It not only secures the future of our Bavarian vehicle plants; it also sends an important signal, underlining Germany’s future viability as a location for industry.\n\nWe hope to start construction within the next year.\n\nThese high-voltage batteries will then be used in our NEUE KLASSE, which will also be produced at our main plant in Munich from 2026 onwards.\n\nWe provided a glimpse of the NEUE KLASSE at the IAA MOBILITY in early September.\n\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse shows how we are designing individual mobility to be more human, more intelligent and more responsible.\n\nFor example, the materials we are developing for the NEUE KLASSE will help reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nAn additional highlight is the Panoramic Vision Display, which uses the entire width of the windscreen and is visible to all passengers.\n\nWhat has always set BMW apart is the perfect interaction of all components – and the unmistakeable, brand-authentic driving dynamics that this enables. We are also taking this unique selling point to a whole new level, with a perfect combination of hardware and software.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is more than just another BMW-brand car. It is a whole new generation of products. We will be releasing six models onto the roads within 24 months – from SAVs to sedans.

At the fourth round of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA), BMW M Team RLL missed out on their third consecutive podium finish. In the 2 hour and 40 minute race, Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Philipp Eng (AUT) finished fifth in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8. Their teammates, Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR), who had finished second at Sebring and Long Beach (both USA), fought for a podium spot for a long time but ultimately dropped back to eighth place in the GTP class in the final stages. In the GTD category, Bill Auberlen and Chandler Hull (both USA) drove the Turner Motorsport #97 BMW M4 GT3 to second place on the podium.\n\nThe two BMW M Hybrid V8s started strongly and made up several positions in the first few laps from their starting positions of seventh and eighth. In the first half of the race, they held their own in the tight GTP field, with car #25 in particular maintaining a consistent pace on course for a podium finish. In the second half of the race, strategy became a crucial factor as the Laguna Seca WeatherTech Raceway is notoriously tough on tyres. During the final pit stop, BMW M Team RLL changed all four tyres on the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, while only changing two on the #25 car. That allowed Farfus and Eng to maintain their fifth place position in the closing stages, while Yelloly and De Phillippi dropped from third to eighth place.\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport gave a strong performance with both BMW M4 GT3s. Bill Auberlen and Chandler Hull celebrated a podium finish in second place, while their teammates Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) finished seventh. The class winners of Sebring and Long Beach, Madison Snow and Bryan Sellers (both USA) of the Paul Miller Racing team, had problems with tyre wear this time and finished in tenth place.\n\nReactions after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"This is not the result we had hoped for.

We started P8 and finished P5 – purely on pace – so we leave with quite a few positives.”\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, 8th place): “Things did not go exactly as we had hoped for the #25 car. Later in the race some of the yellow flags negated the advantage of our four new tyres and in the closing stages we had two new tyres to our competitor’s four. We learned a great deal this weekend so I am positive those lessons will pay off at Watkins Glen.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At the fourth round of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA), BMW M Team RLL missed out on their third consecutive podium finish.

With a total of six victories for the first time in the categories “Sports Bikes”, “Crossover”, “Power Nakeds, “Adventure Touring” “Tourers/Sport Tourers” and “Enduros/Supermotos” as well as a second place and two third places, BMW Motorrad achieved another outstanding result in MOTORRAD magazine’s readers' choice \"Motorcycle of the Year 2025\".\n\n\"Together with the entire BMW Motorrad team, I am very pleased to have won nine awards and to have won six categories for the first time. The fact that three M models once again came out on top in the readers' choice is a strong endorsement of the appeal of our M model range. And the victory of our F 900 GS/Adventure for the first time is clear proof of the high level of acceptance of this off-road all-rounder. On behalf of the entire BMW Motorrad team, I would like to thank the readers of MOTORRAD magazine for their tremendous support. These awards are also a great confirmation of our claim to inspire our customers and fans with the best offers in the various segments with a highly attractive product range and to further consolidate our leading position in the premium motorcycle market,\" said Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW Motorrad, commenting on the results of this year's readers' choice.\n\nIn the \"Sports Bikes\" category, the BMW M 1000 RR continues to dominate this highly competitive and fascinating segment for the fifth year in a row. With its unique mix of sporty riding dynamics on country roads, top racetrack performance and state-of-the-art ride safety systems as well as its highly emotional design, it is once again in first place in the readers' favour for 2025. BMW Motorrad's leading position in the sports bike segment is also underpinned by the third place of the S 1000 RR.\n\nWith the uncompromisingly dynamic BMW M 1000 R powerhouse, a second M model from BMW Motorrad has once again taken the top spot. With its unrivalled chassis technology and aerodynamics, the BMW M 1000 R opens up dimensions of riding dynamics previously reserved for purebred super bikes in its segment, taking the top step of the podium in the Power Naked category. The BMW R 1250 R - with its strong character - also took third place in this category.\n\nFor the second year in a row, the powerful long-distance sports bike BMW M 1000 XR is the top M model from BMW Motorrad. With an engine output of 148 kW (201 hp), an empty weight of just 223 kg and chassis technology and aerodynamics designed for high performance on the open road, long distance touring and fast laps on the race track, the BMW M 1000 XR is the benchmark in its segment and immediately secured first place in the \"Crossover\" category as it did last year.\n\nTogether with its sister model, the R 1300 GS Adventure, the BMW R 1300 GS further cemented the cult status of the BMW boxer GS models by taking first place in the Adventure Touring category. With their new design, powerful engine, outstanding handling and convincing on-road and off-road riding characteristics, both models once again confirm the Bavarian dominance in this hotly contested segment.\n\nWith the new F 900 GS, BMW Motorrad takes the top spot in the Enduro/Supermoto category for the first time. With its greatly enhanced off-road capabilities and significant weight reduction compared to its predecessor, the F 900 GS wins this category for the first time in its debut year.\n\nThe BMW R 1250 RS is another repeat winner. Following the clear victories of the past years, the BMW R 1250 RS is the winner in the \"Tourer/Sport Tourer\" segment once again. Thanks to its excellent all-round qualities in the areas of riding dynamics, sportiness and touring suitability, it was able to keep the strong competition at bay once again.\n\nIn the Modern Classics category, the new BMW R 12 and R 12 nineT models took second place with their combination of classic and purist design, modern technology and legendary air/oil-cooled boxer engine.\n\nThe 27th edition of MOTORRAD magazine's Motorcycle of the Year 2025 Readers' Choice Awards, which are considered to be the most important motorcycle and scooter readers' choice awards in Europe, took place in Stuttgart on 1 April 2025.\n\nYou will find press material on BMW motorcycles in the BMW Group PressClub at \n\nIn case of queries, please contact:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Strong performance from BMW Motorrad, winning six categories and finishing on the podium nine times."}]}

With its unique mix of sporty riding dynamics on country roads, top racetrack performance and state-of-the-art ride safety systems as well as its highly emotional design, it is once again in first place in the readers' favour for 2025. BMW Motorrad's leading position in the sports bike segment is also underpinned by the third place of the S 1000 RR.\n\nWith the uncompromisingly dynamic BMW M 1000 R powerhouse, a second M model from BMW Motorrad has once again taken the top spot. With its unrivalled chassis technology and aerodynamics, the BMW M 1000 R opens up dimensions of riding dynamics previously reserved for purebred super bikes in its segment, taking the top step of the podium in the Power Naked category. The BMW R 1250 R - with its strong character - also took third place in this category.\n\nFor the second year in a row, the powerful long-distance sports bike BMW M 1000 XR is the top M model from BMW Motorrad. With an engine output of 148 kW (201 hp), an empty weight of just 223 kg and chassis technology and aerodynamics designed for high performance on the open road, long distance touring and fast laps on the race track, the BMW M 1000 XR is the benchmark in its segment and immediately secured first place in the \"Crossover\" category as it did last year.\n\nTogether with its sister model, the R 1300 GS Adventure, the BMW R 1300 GS further cemented the cult status of the BMW boxer GS models by taking first place in the Adventure Touring category. With their new design, powerful engine, outstanding handling and convincing on-road and off-road riding characteristics, both models once again confirm the Bavarian dominance in this hotly contested segment.\n\nWith the new F 900 GS, BMW Motorrad takes the top spot in the Enduro/Supermoto category for the first time. With its greatly enhanced off-road capabilities and significant weight reduction compared to its predecessor, the F 900 GS wins this category for the first time in its debut year.\n\nThe BMW R 1250 RS is another repeat winner. Following the clear victories of the past years, the BMW R 1250 RS is the winner in the \"Tourer/Sport Tourer\" segment once again. Thanks to its excellent all-round qualities in the areas of riding dynamics, sportiness and touring suitability, it was able to keep the strong competition at bay once again.\n\nIn the Modern Classics category, the new BMW R 12 and R 12 nineT models took second place with their combination of classic and purist design, modern technology and legendary air/oil-cooled boxer engine.\n\nThe 27th edition of MOTORRAD magazine's Motorcycle of the Year 2025 Readers' Choice Awards, which are considered to be the most important motorcycle and scooter readers' choice awards in Europe, took place in Stuttgart on 1 April 2025.\n\nYou will find press material on BMW motorcycles in the BMW Group PressClub at \n\nIn case of queries, please contact:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW Motorrad achieves top-level result in the MOTORRAD magazine readers’ choice for “Motorcycle of the Year 2025” once again."}]}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport is returning to historic Imola (ITA) with the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). The seventh round of the 2023 WorldSBK season will take place at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari from 14th to 16th July. The WorldSBK has regularly visited Imola in past decades, most recently in 2019. Leon Haslam (GBR) will ride the second BMW M 1000 RR alongside Scott Redding (GBR) in the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team.\n\nHaslam is no stranger to BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the WorldSBK. The 40-year-old Briton has competed in a total of 316 WorldSBK races between 2003 and 2022, finishing as runner-up in the championship in 2010. In 2011 and 2012, he raced as a BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory rider with the BMW S 1000 RR, earning a total of eight podium finishes. In the current 2023 season, Haslam competes with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad British Superbike Team aboard the BMW M 1000 RR in the British Superbike Championship (BSB), where he has already achieved six podium finishes, including two at the recent round at Snetterton (GBR).\n\nImola is a track with a rich tradition, but as it has not been on the WorldSBK calendar in recent years, it is still unfamiliar to some. The ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is already familiar with the circuit from the past, as are Haslam and Loris Baz (FRA). However, Redding has not raced there before, and Garrett Gerloff (USA) will also make his Imola debut, as will the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team.\n\nQuotes ahead of the Imola round.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “First of all, many thanks to Leon for being available at short notice to be with us at Imola. We know each other well from the past, where we celebrated success together, and this season he has returned to the BMW Motorrad family in BSB and is familiar with the new BMW M 1000 RR. He also has a lot of WorldSBK experience, and we are confident that he will quickly get back up to speed at Imola. After his crash at Donington, Tom Sykes is on the road to recovery and was discharged from the hospital on Sunday after a week, and we all send him our best wishes. Michael participated in a track day last week, however a return for Imola would still be too early, and we have jointly decided that he will sit out this weekend, and then we will reassess the situation. Now we are excited about Imola. Scott showed a clear upward trend in Donington, which was confirmed by his fourth-place finish in the second race. Garrett was also fast and consistently strong there and we want to continue that at Imola. However, a major topic will be the high heat expected over the weekend which can be challenging for humans, machines, and tyres.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, #31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “It’s going to be an interesting weekend, I think. It’s a track that I’ve never been to and it looks like it could be technical. But I feel good learning new layouts and this circuit being mainly a left-hand corner dominant one with some elevation changes and being tighter, it kind of reminds me of the tracks I raced in America a lot. I’m hoping this connection is a solid one and it does help me to learn it a bit faster, but I think there’s going to be a few people that haven’t been there or at least haven’t been there for a while. I just hope it will be a good weekend and we can keep improving like we did at Donington.”\n\nScott Redding, #45 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Imola is new track for me so it’s another element to the weekend, I always like new tracks! I hope for a good weekend and to keep the momentum from Donington.”\n\nLoris Baz, #76 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “It has been a tough season and tough couple of weekends with completely no luck unfortunately at the last two rounds, which is a shame, because I feel strong again on the bike. I just need to have a calm weekend, so I hope Imola will be that one. I’m sending my best wishes again to Tom Sykes and Michael Ruben Rinaldi who were involved in the crash at Donington and I hope they can come back soon. For me, I’m really happy to come back to Imola. It’s a track that I always loved a lot and I have good memories there. It’s really an old school circuit with an atmosphere that is so different than the rest of the venues. I’m really looking forward to it. I’m sure we can be fast there. I have experience on this track, I know the layout and everything. I just hope we can put all of our bad luck behind now and have a nice and calm weekend on the BMW M 1000 RR. I know the guys in this team never stop working incredibly hard and I feel it’s definitely time to get our normal mojo back and rediscover the pace that we had in the beginning of this season.”\n\nLeon Haslam, #91 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It’s a fantastic opportunity. Obviously I have a lot of history with Imola. We took the championship in 2010 down to the last round at Imola. I have a lot of history from this circuit and it’s fantastic to ride again for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. We are riding the BMW M 1000 RR in the UK so I’m looking forward to work with Shaun Muir and all the guys from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. We will see. I have no real big expectations, I just want to try to enjoy and hopefully we can get some good information and some good results.”\n\n4.936 km – anti-clockwise\n\n22 – 9 right-handers, 13 left-handers\n\n358 metres (start-finish straight)\n\nStop&Go track with slow and fast chicanes, many changes in elevation, challenging changes of direction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW Motorrad Motorsport is returning to historic Imola (ITA) with the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK).

The seventh round of the 2023 WorldSBK season will take place at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari from 14th to 16th July. The WorldSBK has regularly visited Imola in past decades, most recently in 2019.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport is returning to historic Imola (ITA) with the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK).

The WorldSBK has regularly visited Imola in past decades, most recently in 2019. Leon Haslam (GBR) will ride the second BMW M 1000 RR alongside Scott Redding (GBR) in the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team.\n\nHaslam is no stranger to BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the WorldSBK. The 40-year-old Briton has competed in a total of 316 WorldSBK races between 2003 and 2022, finishing as runner-up in the championship in 2010. In 2011 and 2012, he raced as a BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory rider with the BMW S 1000 RR, earning a total of eight podium finishes. In the current 2023 season, Haslam competes with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad British Superbike Team aboard the BMW M 1000 RR in the British Superbike Championship (BSB), where he has already achieved six podium finishes, including two at the recent round at Snetterton (GBR).\n\nImola is a track with a rich tradition, but as it has not been on the WorldSBK calendar in recent years, it is still unfamiliar to some. The ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is already familiar with the circuit from the past, as are Haslam and Loris Baz (FRA). However, Redding has not raced there before, and Garrett Gerloff (USA) will also make his Imola debut, as will the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team.\n\nQuotes ahead of the Imola round.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “First of all, many thanks to Leon for being available at short notice to be with us at Imola. We know each other well from the past, where we celebrated success together, and this season he has returned to the BMW Motorrad family in BSB and is familiar with the new BMW M 1000 RR. He also has a lot of WorldSBK experience, and we are confident that he will quickly get back up to speed at Imola. After his crash at Donington, Tom Sykes is on the road to recovery and was discharged from the hospital on Sunday after a week, and we all send him our best wishes. Michael participated in a track day last week, however a return for Imola would still be too early, and we have jointly decided that he will sit out this weekend, and then we will reassess the situation. Now we are excited about Imola. Scott showed a clear upward trend in Donington, which was confirmed by his fourth-place finish in the second race. Garrett was also fast and consistently strong there and we want to continue that at Imola. However, a major topic will be the high heat expected over the weekend which can be challenging for humans, machines, and tyres.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, #31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “It’s going to be an interesting weekend, I think. It’s a track that I’ve never been to and it looks like it could be technical. But I feel good learning new layouts and this circuit being mainly a left-hand corner dominant one with some elevation changes and being tighter, it kind of reminds me of the tracks I raced in America a lot. I’m hoping this connection is a solid one and it does help me to learn it a bit faster, but I think there’s going to be a few people that haven’t been there or at least haven’t been there for a while. I just hope it will be a good weekend and we can keep improving like we did at Donington.”\n\nScott Redding, #45 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Imola is new track for me so it’s another element to the weekend, I always like new tracks! I hope for a good weekend and to keep the momentum from Donington.”\n\nLoris Baz, #76 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “It has been a tough season and tough couple of weekends with completely no luck unfortunately at the last two rounds, which is a shame, because I feel strong again on the bike. I just need to have a calm weekend, so I hope Imola will be that one. I’m sending my best wishes again to Tom Sykes and Michael Ruben Rinaldi who were involved in the crash at Donington and I hope they can come back soon. For me, I’m really happy to come back to Imola. It’s a track that I always loved a lot and I have good memories there. It’s really an old school circuit with an atmosphere that is so different than the rest of the venues. I’m really looking forward to it. I’m sure we can be fast there. I have experience on this track, I know the layout and everything. I just hope we can put all of our bad luck behind now and have a nice and calm weekend on the BMW M 1000 RR.

Following the successful BMW Art Generation Vol. III experience at NIROX on 30 August, BMW Group South Africa is proud to serve as the Official Vehicle Partner of FNB Art Joburg, taking place from 4–7 September 2025. This partnership underscores BMW’s enduring commitment to the global arts landscape, building on five decades of the iconic BMW Art Car series and cultural initiatives.\n\nCelebrating 50 Years of BMW Art Cars\n\nSince its inception in 1975, the BMW Art Car Collection has featured works from some of the world’s most acclaimed artists, including Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, and Ólafur Elíasson.\n\nIn 1991, Esther Mahlangu became the first African artist, and the first woman, to design a BMW Art Car, a historic moment that merged African heritage with contemporary automotive design. Her contribution remains a living tribute to her cultural legacy and BMW’s global vision for innovation through art.\n\nThis milestone also coincides with the 50th anniversary of the BMW 3 Series, further highlighting BMW’s tradition of design, craftsmanship, and cultural expression.\n\nImmersive Experience at FNB Art Joburg\n\nBMW’s booth at the Sandton Convention Centre will transform into an immersive storytelling hub, celebrating five decades of the BMW Art Cars. Johannesburg takes its place on the global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enriched by a vibrant array of events.\n\nAt the centre of the installation in Johannesburg are large format works by acclaimed automotive photographer René Staud, who has redefined the way the world sees cars through light and motion. His work traces the journey of the BMW Art Car Collection from the very first Art Car created by Alexander Calder in 1975 (BMW 3.0 CSL) to the most recent, the 20th Art Car by Julie Mehretu (BMW M Hybrid V8). “A photograph of an Art Car is not about chrome or color — it’s about the pleasure to turn speed into poetry,” says René Staud.\n\nAmong the 10 featured BMW Art Cars are:\n\nThese striking images capture not only the vehicles themselves but also the visionary energy of the artists behind them, positioning BMW’s booth as a gallery of movement, design, and innovation.\n\nComplementing this presentation, BMW will also showcase the BMW Art Guide, alongside Jonathan Ball’s ‘To Paint is in My Heart’ — a richly illustrated exploration of Esther Mahlangu’s life and artistic journey. Together, these works invite visitors to experience the full scope of BMW’s cultural legacy, from archival innovation to contemporary vision.\n\n“BMW is celebrating 50 years of the iconic BMW Art Car Collection in 2025, underscoring our longstanding commitment to merging art, design, and innovation.

Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enriched by a vibrant array of events.\n\nAt the centre of the installation in Johannesburg are large format works by acclaimed automotive photographer René Staud, who has redefined the way the world sees cars through light and motion. His work traces the journey of the BMW Art Car Collection from the very first Art Car created by Alexander Calder in 1975 (BMW 3.0 CSL) to the most recent, the 20th Art Car by Julie Mehretu (BMW M Hybrid V8). “A photograph of an Art Car is not about chrome or color — it’s about the pleasure to turn speed into poetry,” says René Staud.\n\nAmong the 10 featured BMW Art Cars are:\n\nThese striking images capture not only the vehicles themselves but also the visionary energy of the artists behind them, positioning BMW’s booth as a gallery of movement, design, and innovation.\n\nComplementing this presentation, BMW will also showcase the BMW Art Guide, alongside Jonathan Ball’s ‘To Paint is in My Heart’ — a richly illustrated exploration of Esther Mahlangu’s life and artistic journey. Together, these works invite visitors to experience the full scope of BMW’s cultural legacy, from archival innovation to contemporary vision.\n\n“BMW is celebrating 50 years of the iconic BMW Art Car Collection in 2025, underscoring our longstanding commitment to merging art, design, and innovation. As both a mobility leader and a cultural partner, we continue to support the arts in South Africa and globally. Through events such as BMW Art Generation and collaborations like BMW Young Collectors Co. and Zeitz MOCCA, we are shaping the future of African art patronage while honouring our legacy” states Taz Ramphisa, General Manager: Customer and Brand, BMW South Africa.\n\nPremium Guest Experiences\n\nAs Official Vehicle Partner, BMW will provide chauffeur-driven services for guests, delivering the hallmark BMW experience of comfort, precision, and seamless mobility.\n\nJoin Us at FNB Art Joburg\n\nBMW invites art lovers, collectors, and cultural innovators to experience this unique convergence of art, design, and mobility. Visit BMW’s stand at FNB Art Joburg from 4–7 September and stay tuned for exciting announcements in 2026.\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nHead of Business Communications\n\nEmail: \n\nBMW Group Cultural Engagement\n\nWhy Culture? Why not! Culture is knowledge, a sanctuary of beauty and depth, of meaning and peace. An inspiring escape. Tranquil at best, even unsettling sometimes. As corporate citizen, the BMW Group takes social responsibility seriously, as part of which it has been involved in hundreds of cultural initiatives worldwide for over half a century, both in the arts, music & sound, architecture as well as in design. As a long-term partner, creative freedom is key – and as essential for groundbreaking works as it is for major innovations within a business enterprise like ours.\n\nInstagram: @BMWGroupCulture\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe economic success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action.

The BMW Group and E.ON have agreed on the first pan-European cooperation for intelligent charging at home. The aim of the strategic cooperation is to create \"Connected Home Charging\", a holistic charging ecosystem that will allow customers to connect their electrified BMW or MINI vehicle with the energy system, as part of a climate-neutral, sustainable household. With this unique cross-sector cooperation, the BMW Group and E.ON are laying the groundwork for harnessing the tremendous potential of electric vehicles for the transformation towards exclusive use of green energy.\n\nFrank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development, says: “BMW represents the 'Ultimate Electric Driving Machine’. But for us, e-mobility is much more than electric driving: green energy, sustainably-sourced raw materials, charging, recycling — we are driving all these key factors forward at the same time. Together with E.ON, we will make the car an intelligent element of the smart home. This will bring more balance to the private energy ecosystem, with lower costs and an improved carbon footprint, and will enable smart integration into the energy market in the future.”\n\nPatrick Lammers, member of the Board of Management of E.ON SE, responsible for the customer solutions business, adds: “E.ON and the BMW Group are already leaders in their industries. We are now leveraging our strengths and combining them to create a unique ecosystem for charging at home. In this way, we will jointly set the standard for electrified vehicles to become part of the energy market in the future and support the energy transition.”\n\nCooperation partners contribute their expertise\n\nThe cooperation will focus on at-home charging, which is already, and will continue to be, the most important use case for charging electrified vehicles. Longer downtimes also mean that at-home charging processes are particularly well suited for intelligent control. The comprehensive ecosystem that E.ON and the BMW Group are building together is being tailored to take at-home charging to a new level. The core element of the ecosystem is the creation of a common interface that combines three complex and previously separate systems: BMW Group electric vehicles, customers' smart homes and the energy market.\n\nTogether, the two partners will span the entire breadth of the ecosystem, each contributing their respective competencies: As part of the cooperation, the BMW Group will be responsible for the vehicles and charging hardware and will manage the interface with the customer with a focus on their mobility needs. In addition to providing installation, electrical and connectivity services at customers' homes, E.ON will also be responsible for ensuring sustainable energy tariffs and access to the energy market, which plays a key role in the intelligent control of charging processes.\n\nCombining the broad expertise of both partners ensures that the vehicle will fit seamlessly into the infrastructure of the user's household and the charging process will run smoothly. At the same time, it allows the benefits of in-house energy generation – for example, through a solar system – and the dynamism of the energy market to be used to benefit the customer.\n\nCustomer offering will be consistently developed and expanded\n\nThe first customer offering of \"Connected Home Charging\" will be available in several European countries from the mid-second half of 2023 and will lay the foundations for hardware and networking as a holistic package solution. Intelligent control of charging processes will initially enable two variants: solar-optimised charging, which allows the largest possible amount of electricity from the home's own photovoltaic system to be used, and load-optimised charging, which optimally balances the amount of electricity available at home. In addition to greater convenience, development and use of the ecosystem also offers customers the potential to save costs, increase household self-sufficiency and optimise their carbon footprint.\n\nIn the coming years, the ecosystem will be consistently expanded to include additional customer benefits: In a second step, this will include cost-optimised charging, which will extend the connectivity of fully-electric vehicles and smart homes to the energy system. Customers can then take advantage of price developments on the power exchange market with a special electricity contract that allows them to charge at low prices whenever possible. This maximises cost efficiency for charging the vehicle. At the same time, the customer's mobility needs always come first – optimal time slots are also determined based on the customer's planned departure time and required range. This option will be available to customers over the next year.\n\nThe cooperation will also create the necessary conditions for enabling bidirectional charging in the future. This technology makes it possible to use the fully-electric vehicle’s high-voltage battery as an energy storage device and feed the stored electricity back into the customer’s own household or the power grid at a later time.\n\nResults from BDL pilot project used in developing customer offering\n\nThe results of the joint research project “Bidirectional Charging Management — BDL”, which was successfully completed at the end of 2022, are being incorporated into development of the future customer offering. The focus was on using a holistic approach for the first time to connect vehicles, charging infrastructure and power grids in a way that promotes renewable energy and increases security of supply. For this purpose, 50 regenerative BMW i3s were provided to customers.\n\nThe results of the research project, which was conducted by the BMW Group and E.ON subsidiaries Bayernwerk and E.ON Energie Deutschland, together with various other players from the automotive industry, charging infrastructure, energy industry and academia, have been consistently positive at all levels. From the customer perspective, the entire system was easy to integrate into everyday life and was found to be useful and worthwhile. This is also reflected in their high willingness to continue using BDL technology.\n\nWith regard to the ‘vehicle to grid’ application, i.e., feeding energy into the power grid, the effectiveness of bidirectional charging management was demonstrated: On the one hand, intelligently controlled integration of electric vehicles into the power grid can further increase renewable energy as a share of total consumption in Germany. On the other, electric vehicle storage systems can absorb peaks in production from wind and solar plants in a targeted manner and release them again in times of low generation, while continuing to meet customers' driving needs. This can reduce the need to fire up fossil-fuel power plants and their emissions at such times. In addition, bidirectional charging technology can thus contribute to supply security and grid stability.\n\nSmart charging has huge potential\n\nFrom the BMW Group and E.ON perspective, the project results underline the tremendous potential of bidirectional charging and demonstrate the central role that technology will play in holistic energy management in the future. Cost advantages can already be achieved with standard unidirectional charging, by taking advantage of cost-optimised time slots and relying on solar power from the household's own photovoltaic system – preferably using renewable energy. This is the aim of the solar-optimised and load-optimised charging options that will be available in several European countries from the middle of the second half of the year.\n\nBidirectional charging technology will enable further functionality and optimisations in the ecosystem, such as allowing the electric vehicle to provide grid-supporting and stabilising services as part of bidirectional charging or the more comprehensive, optimised use of green energy through the entire power grid.\n\nAgainst this background, both partners will focus their efforts on the opportunities offered by bidirectional charging and its two central use cases: ‘vehicle to home’ (feeding electricity from the high-voltage battery into the household) and ‘vehicle to grid’ (feeding electricity from the high-voltage battery into the power grid) — with the clear aim of creating appropriate customer offerings in the medium term.\n\nSuccessful cooperation expanded and intensified\n\nThis cooperation on intelligent at-home charging expands the successful cooperation between E.ON and the BMW Group. The BMW Group operates one of Germany’s largest company charging networks, which E.ON has built up since 2019. It now comprises more than 5,500 charging points at eight German locations. More than 1,600 of these are eRoaming-capable and therefore publicly accessible. Expansion will continue in 2023 and 2024: BMW branches in Germany will also be connected to the company charging network, which will then include more than 6,000 charging points. All charging points are powered entirely by renewable energies.\n\nSebastian Kessler, Spokesperson Charging Infrastructure, Politics\n\nEckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nE.ON SE Communications\n\nIsabel Reinhardt, Spokesperson\n\nIn 2022, the BMW Group sold nearly 2.4 million passenger vehicles and more than 202,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2022 was € 23.5 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.6 billion. As of 31 December 2022, the BMW Group had a workforce of 149,475 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. The company set the course for the future at an early stage and consistently makes sustainability and efficient resource management central to its strategic direction, from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Multi-stage Europe-wide cooperation for intelligent at-home charging +++ Initial customer offering in second half of 2023 +++ Results from bidirectional charging pilot project will be incorporated into development of customer offering +++"}]}

The aim of the strategic cooperation is to create \"Connected Home Charging\", a holistic charging ecosystem that will allow customers to connect their electrified BMW or MINI vehicle with the energy system, as part of a climate-neutral, sustainable household. With this unique cross-sector cooperation, the BMW Group and E.ON are laying the groundwork for harnessing the tremendous potential of electric vehicles for the transformation towards exclusive use of green energy.\n\nFrank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development, says: “BMW represents the 'Ultimate Electric Driving Machine’. But for us, e-mobility is much more than electric driving: green energy, sustainably-sourced raw materials, charging, recycling — we are driving all these key factors forward at the same time. Together with E.ON, we will make the car an intelligent element of the smart home. This will bring more balance to the private energy ecosystem, with lower costs and an improved carbon footprint, and will enable smart integration into the energy market in the future.”\n\nPatrick Lammers, member of the Board of Management of E.ON SE, responsible for the customer solutions business, adds: “E.ON and the BMW Group are already leaders in their industries. We are now leveraging our strengths and combining them to create a unique ecosystem for charging at home. In this way, we will jointly set the standard for electrified vehicles to become part of the energy market in the future and support the energy transition.”\n\nCooperation partners contribute their expertise\n\nThe cooperation will focus on at-home charging, which is already, and will continue to be, the most important use case for charging electrified vehicles. Longer downtimes also mean that at-home charging processes are particularly well suited for intelligent control. The comprehensive ecosystem that E.ON and the BMW Group are building together is being tailored to take at-home charging to a new level. The core element of the ecosystem is the creation of a common interface that combines three complex and previously separate systems: BMW Group electric vehicles, customers' smart homes and the energy market.\n\nTogether, the two partners will span the entire breadth of the ecosystem, each contributing their respective competencies: As part of the cooperation, the BMW Group will be responsible for the vehicles and charging hardware and will manage the interface with the customer with a focus on their mobility needs. In addition to providing installation, electrical and connectivity services at customers' homes, E.ON will also be responsible for ensuring sustainable energy tariffs and access to the energy market, which plays a key role in the intelligent control of charging processes.\n\nCombining the broad expertise of both partners ensures that the vehicle will fit seamlessly into the infrastructure of the user's household and the charging process will run smoothly. At the same time, it allows the benefits of in-house energy generation – for example, through a solar system – and the dynamism of the energy market to be used to benefit the customer.\n\nCustomer offering will be consistently developed and expanded\n\nThe first customer offering of \"Connected Home Charging\" will be available in several European countries from the mid-second half of 2023 and will lay the foundations for hardware and networking as a holistic package solution. Intelligent control of charging processes will initially enable two variants: solar-optimised charging, which allows the largest possible amount of electricity from the home's own photovoltaic system to be used, and load-optimised charging, which optimally balances the amount of electricity available at home. In addition to greater convenience, development and use of the ecosystem also offers customers the potential to save costs, increase household self-sufficiency and optimise their carbon footprint.\n\nIn the coming years, the ecosystem will be consistently expanded to include additional customer benefits: In a second step, this will include cost-optimised charging, which will extend the connectivity of fully-electric vehicles and smart homes to the energy system. Customers can then take advantage of price developments on the power exchange market with a special electricity contract that allows them to charge at low prices whenever possible. This maximises cost efficiency for charging the vehicle. At the same time, the customer's mobility needs always come first – optimal time slots are also determined based on the customer's planned departure time and required range. This option will be available to customers over the next year.\n\nThe cooperation will also create the necessary conditions for enabling bidirectional charging in the future. This technology makes it possible to use the fully-electric vehicle’s high-voltage battery as an energy storage device and feed the stored electricity back into the customer’s own household or the power grid at a later time.\n\nResults from BDL pilot project used in developing customer offering\n\nThe results of the joint research project “Bidirectional Charging Management — BDL”, which was successfully completed at the end of 2022, are being incorporated into development of the future customer offering. The focus was on using a holistic approach for the first time to connect vehicles, charging infrastructure and power grids in a way that promotes renewable energy and increases security of supply. For this purpose, 50 regenerative BMW i3s were provided to customers.\n\nThe results of the research project, which was conducted by the BMW Group and E.ON subsidiaries Bayernwerk and E.ON Energie Deutschland, together with various other players from the automotive industry, charging infrastructure, energy industry and academia, have been consistently positive at all levels. From the customer perspective, the entire system was easy to integrate into everyday life and was found to be useful and worthwhile. This is also reflected in their high willingness to continue using BDL technology.\n\nWith regard to the ‘vehicle to grid’ application, i.e., feeding energy into the power grid, the effectiveness of bidirectional charging management was demonstrated: On the one hand, intelligently controlled integration of electric vehicles into the power grid can further increase renewable energy as a share of total consumption in Germany. On the other, electric vehicle storage systems can absorb peaks in production from wind and solar plants in a targeted manner and release them again in times of low generation, while continuing to meet customers' driving needs. This can reduce the need to fire up fossil-fuel power plants and their emissions at such times. In addition, bidirectional charging technology can thus contribute to supply security and grid stability.\n\nSmart charging has huge potential\n\nFrom the BMW Group and E.ON perspective, the project results underline the tremendous potential of bidirectional charging and demonstrate the central role that technology will play in holistic energy management in the future. Cost advantages can already be achieved with standard unidirectional charging, by taking advantage of cost-optimised time slots and relying on solar power from the household's own photovoltaic system – preferably using renewable energy. This is the aim of the solar-optimised and load-optimised charging options that will be available in several European countries from the middle of the second half of the year.\n\nBidirectional charging technology will enable further functionality and optimisations in the ecosystem, such as allowing the electric vehicle to provide grid-supporting and stabilising services as part of bidirectional charging or the more comprehensive, optimised use of green energy through the entire power grid.\n\nAgainst this background, both partners will focus their efforts on the opportunities offered by bidirectional charging and its two central use cases: ‘vehicle to home’ (feeding electricity from the high-voltage battery into the household) and ‘vehicle to grid’ (feeding electricity from the high-voltage battery into the power grid) — with the clear aim of creating appropriate customer offerings in the medium term.\n\nSuccessful cooperation expanded and intensified\n\nThis cooperation on intelligent at-home charging expands the successful cooperation between E.ON and the BMW Group. The BMW Group operates one of Germany’s largest company charging networks, which E.ON has built up since 2019. It now comprises more than 5,500 charging points at eight German locations. More than 1,600 of these are eRoaming-capable and therefore publicly accessible. Expansion will continue in 2023 and 2024: BMW branches in Germany will also be connected to the company charging network, which will then include more than 6,000 charging points. All charging points are powered entirely by renewable energies.\n\nSebastian Kessler, Spokesperson Charging Infrastructure, Politics\n\nEckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nE.ON SE Communications\n\nIsabel Reinhardt, Spokesperson\n\nIn 2022, the BMW Group sold nearly 2.4 million passenger vehicles and more than 202,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2022 was € 23.5 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.6 billion. As of 31 December 2022, the BMW Group had a workforce of 149,475 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. The company set the course for the future at an early stage and consistently makes sustainability and efficient resource management central to its strategic direction, from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The 35th BMW International Open will take place from 3rd to 7th July 2024 at Golfclub München Eichenried. Tournament organiser BMW has once again put together a magnificent sporting and event experience, both for visitors at the course and golf fans unable to make it there in person. The following document provides a compact rundown of everything you need to know about the 2024 BMW International Open.\n\nBMW has been the organiser of the BMW International Open since 1989. No other tournament on the DP World Tour has been held for so long under the same name and with the same partner. The BMW International Open was also BMW’s first involvement in professional golf. The roots of the BMW Golf Cup, which has long since established itself as the largest international tournament series for amateur golfers, stretch back as far as 1982.\n\nA legend bids farewell.\n\nFew have left such a mark on the BMW International Open as Germany’s most successful golfer, Bernhard Langer. He tees off in Munich for the first time since 2012, offering German golf fans the opportunity to bid a worthy farewell to the two-time major winner: Langer will be making his final appearance on the DP World Tour.\n\nEagles for Education.\n\nAs it did last year (total raised in 2023: € 99,000), the BMW Group will again donate € 1,000 for every eagle carded during the tournament to Munich-based organisations “JOBLINGE” and “Kick ins Leben”. In doing so, the company is improving the prospects of disadvantaged young people from the local area. Visitors can also do their bit. There will be three vending machines (Tournament Village, beer garden area by the 4th/8th/11th tee, and Fairway Club), at which powerbanks will be available for charging mobile devices. The service itself is free of charge, with a simple € 20 deposit required. When returning the powerbank, all or part of that deposit can be donated to “Eagles for Education”.\n\nLong drive show match with Martin Borgmeier and friends.\n\nIt’s going to be long, loud and spectacular. Immediately after the close of play on Thursday evening (approx. 18:30), the 18th green will host another highlight: “Launch Control – A Longdrive Competition presented by BMW & Martin Borgmeier”. The German long drive world champion will go up against two top-class opponents in a show match: Ryan “The Canadian Lumberjack” Gregnol (CAN) and Sam Judah (USA). The ladies competition sees local favourite and European amateur long drive champion Sonya Knebel take on Cassandra Meyer and Gabi Powel (both USA).

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nMunich. The Neue Klasse will usher in a new era of fully electric driving at the BMW Group – the success of which will depend heavily on the production of powerful high-voltage batteries. That’s why the BMW Group is expanding its production network for the next generation of high-voltage batteries significantly. “We are setting up five facilities on three continents to produce our sixth-generation high-voltage batteries,” explained Milan Nedeljković, Board Member for Production at BMW AG. Across the globe, the principle of “local for local” will apply: \"Close connection of battery production with vehicle production is part of our strategy,\" explains Markus Fallböhmer, Senior Vice President of Battery Production at BMW AG. This helps the BMW Group increase the resilience of its production.\n\nBattery and vehicle production closely connected\n\nThe Neue Klasse will be the first to incorporate the all-new cylindrical cells. These represent a technological leap by the BMW Group, offering vastly improved energy density, charging times and range. They will be assembled in new facilities located as closely as possible to vehicle plants, in keeping with the principle of “local for local”. State-of-the-art assembly plants for sixth-generation high-voltage batteries are currently under construction in Irlbach-Strasskirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Woodruff (near Plant Spartanburg in the US), Shenyang (China) and San Luis Potosí, Mexico. With the “local for local” approach in place, production will be able to continue even when unexpected political or economic events occur. In addition, short distances between battery and vehicle plants will reduce the carbon footprint of car production. The BMW Group is also upgrading its existing sites and therefore securing and creating jobs.\n\nNeue Klasse to launch first at Plant Debrecen in 2025\n\nThe first Neue Klasse vehicles will be produced at the BMW Group’s new plant in Debrecen, starting in 2025. High-voltage battery and vehicle manufacturing will launch in parallel. With the training centre in Debrecen open since autumn 2023 and the communications centre in use since February 2024, a large number of employees are already at work in their offices at the site. The production team, meanwhile, are preparing for their new jobs at various locations across the BMW Group production network. This will ensure a smooth start to pre-series production and a successful series launch in the second half of 2025. Currently, the final buildings are being completed. They will be handed over to the technologies by the end of the year.\n\nHigh-voltage batteries from Lower Bavaria\n\nThe BMW Group is also going to manufacture high-voltage batteries for Neue Klasse models in Germany – specifically in Irlbach-Straßkirchen, in Lower Bavaria. The new facility will supply sixth-generation high-voltage batteries to German car plants. The BMW Group was granted permission to build the new high-voltage battery assembly plant in April 2024 and erected the first of pillar for the production hall in late June 2024. The production building is scheduled to be enclosed with facade and roof by the end of the year. The citizens of Straßkirchen had previously voted in favour of the BMW Group coming to their area, with a clear majority in the referendum of September 2023.\n\nChina to produce the Neue Klasse from 2026\n\nFrom 2026 Neue Klasse vehicles will also be made by BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) in Shenyang, China. Here, too, the sixth-generation high-voltage batteries required for the cars will be manufactured locally. The production hall was completed in November 2023 after a construction time of only 21 months. The installation of plant and machinery has been underway since March 2024. Preparing for the launch of the Neue Klasse, the BMW Group has also set up its largest R&D network outside Germany, with facilities in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and Nanjing.\n\nNeue Klasse in Mexico from 2027\n\nAt San Luis Potosí in Mexico, additional production capacity is being established for series production of the Neue Klasse to start in 2027. Construction of the new high-voltage battery assembly plant started in May 2024 and will comprise more than 80,000 square metres of production space when completed. But the integration of battery assembly is not all that’s changing at Plant San Luis Potosí: the bodyshop is set to grow to more than 90,000 square metres in total, while vehicle assembly and logistics spaces will expand by nearly 10,000 square metres. The BMW Group is the first premium OEM to manufacture fully electric cars and high-voltage batteries in Mexico – and a pioneer in the industry. Additionally, the company plans to expand the photovoltaic systems within the plant and thus double the power generated from photovoltaics. This is intended to generate more than 20 percent of the current electricity demand directly on the plant premises in the future.\n\nBMW Group Plant Woodruff: High-voltage batteries for Spartanburg\n\nElectromobility is also advancing in South Carolina. BMW Group Plant Woodruff will cover an area of about 93 hectares and consist of a technology building, ancillary structures, an energy centre, a staff restaurant, a fire department and a Talent Campus. It will create more than 300 new jobs with the BMW Group. When construction reaches completion in 2026, Woodruff will assemble high-voltage batteries for fully electric cars made in nearby Plant Spartanburg. The ground-breaking ceremony for the first building in Woodruff – the training centre – was in June 2023.\n\nBattery expertise concentrated in Parsdorf and Munich\n\nPrototype battery cells like the ones in the Neue Klasse, launching in 2025, are already being made at the BMW Group’s Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf, just east of Munich.

The Neue Klasse will usher in a new era of fully electric driving at the BMW Group – the success of which will depend heavily on the production of powerful high-voltage batteries. That’s why the BMW Group is expanding its production network for the next generation of high-voltage batteries significantly. “We are setting up five facilities on three continents to produce our sixth-generation high-voltage batteries,” explained Milan Nedeljković, Board Member for Production at BMW AG. Across the globe, the principle of “local for local” will apply: \"Close connection of battery production with vehicle production is part of our strategy,\" explains Markus Fallböhmer, Senior Vice President of Battery Production at BMW AG. This helps the BMW Group increase the resilience of its production.\n\nBattery and vehicle production closely connected\n\nThe Neue Klasse will be the first to incorporate the all-new cylindrical cells. These represent a technological leap by the BMW Group, offering vastly improved energy density, charging times and range. They will be assembled in new facilities located as closely as possible to vehicle plants, in keeping with the principle of “local for local”. State-of-the-art assembly plants for sixth-generation high-voltage batteries are currently under construction in Irlbach-Strasskirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Woodruff (near Plant Spartanburg in the US), Shenyang (China) and San Luis Potosí, Mexico. With the “local for local” approach in place, production will be able to continue even when unexpected political or economic events occur. In addition, short distances between battery and vehicle plants will reduce the carbon footprint of car production. The BMW Group is also upgrading its existing sites and therefore securing and creating jobs.\n\nNeue Klasse to launch first at Plant Debrecen in 2025\n\nThe first Neue Klasse vehicles will be produced at the BMW Group’s new plant in Debrecen, starting in 2025. High-voltage battery and vehicle manufacturing will launch in parallel. With the training centre in Debrecen open since autumn 2023 and the communications centre in use since February 2024, a large number of employees are already at work in their offices at the site. The production team, meanwhile, are preparing for their new jobs at various locations across the BMW Group production network. This will ensure a smooth start to pre-series production and a successful series launch in the second half of 2025. Currently, the final buildings are being completed. They will be handed over to the technologies by the end of the year.\n\nHigh-voltage batteries from Lower Bavaria\n\nThe BMW Group is also going to manufacture high-voltage batteries for Neue Klasse models in Germany – specifically in Irlbach-Straßkirchen, in Lower Bavaria. The new facility will supply sixth-generation high-voltage batteries to German car plants. The BMW Group was granted permission to build the new high-voltage battery assembly plant in April 2024 and erected the first of pillar for the production hall in late June 2024. The production building is scheduled to be enclosed with facade and roof by the end of the year. The citizens of Straßkirchen had previously voted in favour of the BMW Group coming to their area, with a clear majority in the referendum of September 2023.\n\nChina to produce the Neue Klasse from 2026\n\nFrom 2026 Neue Klasse vehicles will also be made by BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) in Shenyang, China.

Four days of top-class golf at the 34th BMW International Open ended with a tense and dramatic final round. It was a brilliant birdie on the 17th, which had proven to be a tough hole today, that saw Lawrence take a decisive one-shot lead and move ahead of yesterday’s leader Joost Luiten (NED). The 26-year-old South African hit rounds of 71, 69, 66 and 69 on his way to a final score of 13 under par (275 shots) and his fourth title on the DP World Tour.\n\n“Congratulations to Thriston Lawrence on his victory at the 34th BMW International Open. The conditions on the Championship Course were very challenging at times, which makes his performance all the more impressive,” said Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Real Estate, Labour Relations Director. “We have had a fantastic tournament week, with three holes-in-one and 59 eagles, which allowed us to raise 99,000 Euro for ‘Eagles for Education’. This will help to achieve more equal opportunity and greater educational equality.”\n\nThe BMW Group is donating 1,000 Euro for every eagle scored at the BMW International Open. The money goes to the “JOBLINGE” and “Kick ins Leben” organisations, with whom the BMW Group has been working for many years. In recognition of the remarkable sporting achievement, BMW is also giving a donation of 10,000 Euro for a hole-in-one. ‘Eagles for Education’ started on Tuesday, when BMW donated 10,000 Euro on behalf of the big names on the practice round, including football stars Gareth Bale (WAL) and Thomas Müller (GER), as well as last year’s winner Haotong Li (CHN) and the current German number one Yannik Paul.\n\nLawrence started his final round on Sunday four shots behind Luiten, and endured a “rollercoaster ride” over the course of the day: he carded six birdies on the first 13 holes – but also five bogies. However, of the leading group, it was the South African who finished strongest with two birdies on the 15th and 17th holes. His Dutch rival, on the other hand, could do no better than one birdie and three bogies, meaning he trailed Lawrence by one shot as he arrived at the 18th tee. An aggressive drive over the water came up just short, so the 37-year-old could only lay up with his second shot. Despite this, he still found himself with a long birdie putt to take the tournament into a play-off. The putt from the fringe missed the hole by mere millimetres – and Lawrence emerged victorious.\n\n“I saw that Joost Luiten was not going that well, and that I had played the last four holes a few shots under par on the previous days. The idea was to stick to the game plan and enjoy playing at the same time. I am very proud that I could stay calm,” said Lawrence. “I did not know that Ernie Els was the only South African to have won the BMW International Open. I feel very honoured. He was my idol and his junior foundation really supported me.”\n\nTied in third place on 11 under par were Adrian Meronk (POL), Rikuya Hoshino (JPN), Daniel Hillier (NZL) and Max Kieffer, who was the top German in the field. “It is nice to have been in contention for victory again on the Sunday at my home tournament, but I should have taken the opportunity today. That hurts. The finish here – 16, 17, 18 – is spectacular, and that is exactly what we want on the Tour. However, it means that anything can happen,” said Kieffer. “The reception from the fans on the 18th green was magnificent. The BMW International Open is by far my favourite tournament, and I would have loved to have lifted the trophy here. I will be back to try again.”\n\nThe best-placed amateur was Jonas Baumgartner. The 20-year-old from GC Hösel finished tied in 52nd place on +1 (289 shots). “Making the cut as an amateur was a fantastic experience,” said Baumgartner. “It has been a really good week, during which I have gained a lot of valuable experience.”\n\nMarcel Schneider (-6, T14), Max Schmitt, Matti Schmid (both -5, T18), Thomas Rosenmüller (-4, T26), Hurly Long (-2, T38), Velten Meyer (Even Par, T47), Marc Hammer (+2, T59), Jannik de Bruyn, Philipp Mejow (both +3, T62), Michael Hirmer (+4, T67) and Marcel Siem (+7, T73) completed the contingent of 13 homegrown players who successfully made the cut.

Four days of top-class golf at the 34th BMW International Open ended with a tense and dramatic final round. It was a brilliant birdie on the 17th, which had proven to be a tough hole today, that saw Lawrence take a decisive one-shot lead and move ahead of yesterday’s leader Joost Luiten (NED). The 26-year-old South African hit rounds of 71, 69, 66 and 69 on his way to a final score of 13 under par (275 shots) and his fourth title on the DP World Tour.\n\n“Congratulations to Thriston Lawrence on his victory at the 34th BMW International Open. The conditions on the Championship Course were very challenging at times, which makes his performance all the more impressive,” said Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Real Estate, Labour Relations Director. “We have had a fantastic tournament week, with three holes-in-one and 59 eagles, which allowed us to raise 99,000 Euro for ‘Eagles for Education’. This will help to achieve more equal opportunity and greater educational equality.”\n\nThe BMW Group is donating 1,000 Euro for every eagle scored at the BMW International Open. The money goes to the “JOBLINGE” and “Kick ins Leben” organisations, with whom the BMW Group has been working for many years. In recognition of the remarkable sporting achievement, BMW is also giving a donation of 10,000 Euro for a hole-in-one. ‘Eagles for Education’ started on Tuesday, when BMW donated 10,000 Euro on behalf of the big names on the practice round, including football stars Gareth Bale (WAL) and Thomas Müller (GER), as well as last year’s winner Haotong Li (CHN) and the current German number one Yannik Paul.\n\nLawrence started his final round on Sunday four shots behind Luiten, and endured a “rollercoaster ride” over the course of the day: he carded six birdies on the first 13 holes – but also five bogies. However, of the leading group, it was the South African who finished strongest with two birdies on the 15th and 17th holes. His Dutch rival, on the other hand, could do no better than one birdie and three bogies, meaning he trailed Lawrence by one shot as he arrived at the 18th tee. An aggressive drive over the water came up just short, so the 37-year-old could only lay up with his second shot. Despite this, he still found himself with a long birdie putt to take the tournament into a play-off. The putt from the fringe missed the hole by mere millimetres – and Lawrence emerged victorious.\n\n“I saw that Joost Luiten was not going that well, and that I had played the last four holes a few shots under par on the previous days. The idea was to stick to the game plan and enjoy playing at the same time. I am very proud that I could stay calm,” said Lawrence. “I did not know that Ernie Els was the only South African to have won the BMW International Open. I feel very honoured. He was my idol and his junior foundation really supported me.”\n\nTied in third place on 11 under par were Adrian Meronk (POL), Rikuya Hoshino (JPN), Daniel Hillier (NZL) and Max Kieffer, who was the top German in the field. “It is nice to have been in contention for victory again on the Sunday at my home tournament, but I should have taken the opportunity today. That hurts. The finish here – 16, 17, 18 – is spectacular, and that is exactly what we want on the Tour. However, it means that anything can happen,” said Kieffer. “The reception from the fans on the 18th green was magnificent.

The new BMW Photo Award Leipzig will support artists every two years who either have a biographical connection to Leipzig and the region or who consciously engage with the city and its surroundings in their artistic work. The prerequisite is work in the medium of photography or related visual media. The three winners are selected by a changing, international jury consisting of artists, curators, art academy professors and other experts. Each jury member proposes three positions. The prize is endowed with €5,000 per artist and is linked to a joint exhibition including a catalogue at the Museum der bildenden Künste Leipzig (MdbK). The BMW Niederlassung Leipzig and the BMW Group have regularly supported the MdbK with purchases and exhibitions since 2005.\n\nBMW and the MdbK pursue several aims with the awarding of the prize. Firstly, it is about a general strengthening of Leipzig as a centre for photography and the photographers working there. Particularly young positions and those which, in the jury's view, have not yet been adequately recognised in public, should be highlighted. In addition, the award is an expression of the high value placed on photography at the MdbK and the museum's collaboration with BMW in this field, which has been ongoing for over 20 years. Finally, the exhibition of the prize-winning works is intended to make an artistic contribution to social self-assurance about the history and present of the city and possible perspectives for its future.\n\nThe award ceremony will take place on 6 June 2024 as part of the opening of the exhibition (7. June - 15. September 2024).\n\nThe jury The jury for the first BMW Photo Award Leipzig met at the MdbK in early December. Its members consisted of Ines Schaber (Professor of Photography and Media, Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig), Inka Schube (Curator of Photography, Sprengel Museum Hannover), Andrzej Steinbach (artist, Berlin), Christoph Wiesner (Director of Rencontres de la Photographie d'Arles) and Philipp Freytag (Curator of Photography and Media Art at the MdbK).

This applies to the social conditions and developmental psychological circumstances she has documented as well as to her photographic approach. Her humanistic social documentary photography combines high artistic standards with concrete sociological questions. This makes her exemplary for the tradition of Leipzig photography in the last third of the 20th century.\" (Philipp Freytag, curator for photography and media art at the MdbK)\n\nSusanne Keichel: Born 1981 in Dresden | 2000-2003 training as a photographer with Stefan Thurmann in Hamburg | 2003-2005 freelance photo assistant in Hamburg | 2006/2007 guest student in Jitka Hanzlová's seminar at the HFBK Hamburg | 2013 diploma in photography at the HGB | 2016 master student graduate with Tina Bara. Susanne Keichel lives and works in Dresden.\n\n\"In her work, Susanne Keichel deals with questions of racism, classism and social justice.

The 2023 season in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) concluded with an eventful 26th running of the Petit Le Mans endurance race at Road Atlanta (USA). In the ten-hour race, marked by numerous accidents and numerous deployments of the BMW XM Safety Car, the two BMW M Team RLL BMW M Hybrid V8 prototypes finished in seventh and eighth positions in the new GTP class. Turner Motorsport secured a podium finish in the GTD class with the BMW M4 GT3.\n\nAfter ten hours filled with incidents, the race ended behind the safety car. The #25 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Connor De Phillippi (USA), Nick Yelloly (GBR), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), finished in seventh place. Directly behind them was the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, which had Augusto Farfus (BRA), Philipp Eng (AUT) and Marco Wittmann (GER) alternating at the wheel.\n\nThe Petit Le Mans race marked the end of the debut season for the BMW M Hybrid V8. In the nine races held in the new GTP class of the IMSA this year BMW M Team RLL secured five podium finishes with the vehicle, including a victory in the six-hour race at Watkins Glen (USA).\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport concluded the season with a podium finish. Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher and Michael Dinan (all USA) secured second place on the Petit Le Mans podium in the #96 BMW M4 GT3. Their teammates, Bill Auberlen, Chandler Hull and Thomas Merrill (all USA), finished seventh in the class in the #97 car. Unfortunately, Paul Miller Racing, which had already secured the drivers’ and manufacturers’ titles in the GTD class before the season finale and also were the first team to win the IMSA Sprint Cup back-to-back, had a stroke of bad luck. The #1 BMW M4 GT3 driven by Bryan Sellers, Madison Snow and Corey Lewis (all USA) was involved in an accident that was not their fault. After an extended repair break, the team initially resumed the race but eventually had to retire. Paul Miller Racing celebrated no fewer than five GTD wins this season.\n\nQuotes after Petit Le Mans.\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “Today it certainly wasn’t the result we had hoped for. In the first nine hours, things were looking very promising for us, and at times, we were right up there competing for the lead and a top result. Unfortunately, we were set back in the closing stages due to numerous yellow flags, and we couldn’t achieve the positions we had set out for. This also means we didn’t end up where we had hoped to be in the championship. It was a disappointing conclusion to the season, but we can look ahead positively. In nine races, we made it to the podium five times, which is a great record. A big thank you to everyone who made this possible. Now the work continues at home, and we’re hoping for a strong start to the 2024 season in Daytona.”\n\nBobby Rahal, Team Principal BMW M Team RLL: “Overall, the season was pretty successful. We had five podiums, including the victory at Watkins Glen. When we look back where we were a year ago it has been crazy and we reacted well to the challenges we had. Like it is in every first year, there was a lot to learn and we learnt a lot. Thanks to everyone for their hard work. Now we are looking forward to next season and it will be a very exciting year.”\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8): “So Petit Le Mans is in the books. It was definitely not the result we wanted and not the result we could have gotten. We just did not play it aggressive enough at the end when it counted, unfortunately. I feel sorry for the guys. Everybody worked so hard all year. We can be proud of the results we achieved this season. We will come back next year and fight even harder.”\n\nNick Yelloly (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8): “It has not been the ideal end to the season. During the race we were theoretically leading the championship so we are a bit disappointed now, obviously. But one thing I have to say is: we still got five podiums through the year, including one win, and I feel we maximized as much as we could throughout the season. So a big credit to BMW M Motorsport and the entire BMW M Team RLL for working so hard, because after Daytona we did not think that we would be able to achieve what we did.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8): “It obviously did not end how we wanted in regards of the championship. We were going for the win for the #25 boys, for Nick and Connor. In the end I think we just ultimately did not have the pace in comparison to other cars. But we gave everything out there today. We really did not leave any stone unturned. It has been a pleasure to join the team again for the last event of the year. Of course we are a bit disappointed, but nevertheless the guys can be proud of what they achieved this season.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “It was definitely a lot of fun. Driving the car on this track is truly unbeatable. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the result we all hoped for, especially for our sister car. It looked promising for the championship for a long time, but, sadly, it didn’t work out in the end. However, we can be proud of what we’ve achieved this year. The progress has always been positive, and we can build on that. Thanks to everyone who was involved in this.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “I think we tried. First of all, we finished the race trouble-free with both cars. Today we just did not have the pace. We tried on the strategy, on the fuel saving. The team was very much on it, but in the end we just did not have enough. But it is okay. It was the first season in the GTP class. Now we go back home, we learn and then we should come back next year much stronger.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “In the end, we can be proud of how the year went for us. When we started in Daytona, we probably did’t think that we could be very successful over the season. The team managed to secure five podium finishes. Of course, we had hoped for a different outcome in the final race. It looked promising for a while, but, ultimately, we didn’t quite have the pace compared to our competitors, who were faster over the course of the race. Consequently, there was nothing more to gain for us in the final stages. Even the yellow flags didn’t change that. We have to acknowledge that the competition did a better job this weekend. For us, it means taking the lessons and coming back stronger next year.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 2023 IMSA season concluded with an eventful 26th running of the Petit Le Mans endurance race at Road Atlanta (USA).

So a big credit to BMW M Motorsport and the entire BMW M Team RLL for working so hard, because after Daytona we did not think that we would be able to achieve what we did.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8): “It obviously did not end how we wanted in regards of the championship. We were going for the win for the #25 boys, for Nick and Connor. In the end I think we just ultimately did not have the pace in comparison to other cars. But we gave everything out there today. We really did not leave any stone unturned. It has been a pleasure to join the team again for the last event of the year. Of course we are a bit disappointed, but nevertheless the guys can be proud of what they achieved this season.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “It was definitely a lot of fun. Driving the car on this track is truly unbeatable. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the result we all hoped for, especially for our sister car. It looked promising for the championship for a long time, but, sadly, it didn’t work out in the end. However, we can be proud of what we’ve achieved this year. The progress has always been positive, and we can build on that. Thanks to everyone who was involved in this.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “I think we tried. First of all, we finished the race trouble-free with both cars. Today we just did not have the pace. We tried on the strategy, on the fuel saving. The team was very much on it, but in the end we just did not have enough. But it is okay. It was the first season in the GTP class. Now we go back home, we learn and then we should come back next year much stronger.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “In the end, we can be proud of how the year went for us. When we started in Daytona, we probably did’t think that we could be very successful over the season. The team managed to secure five podium finishes. Of course, we had hoped for a different outcome in the final race. It looked promising for a while, but, ultimately, we didn’t quite have the pace compared to our competitors, who were faster over the course of the race. Consequently, there was nothing more to gain for us in the final stages. Even the yellow flags didn’t change that. We have to acknowledge that the competition did a better job this weekend. For us, it means taking the lessons and coming back stronger next year.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "2023 IMSA season finale: BMW M Team RLL finishes seventh and eighth in eventful Petit Le Mans – GTD podium for Turner Motorsport."}]}

The #25 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Connor De Phillippi (USA), Nick Yelloly (GBR), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), finished in seventh place. Directly behind them was the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, which had Augusto Farfus (BRA), Philipp Eng (AUT) and Marco Wittmann (GER) alternating at the wheel.\n\nThe Petit Le Mans race marked the end of the debut season for the BMW M Hybrid V8. In the nine races held in the new GTP class of the IMSA this year BMW M Team RLL secured five podium finishes with the vehicle, including a victory in the six-hour race at Watkins Glen (USA).\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport concluded the season with a podium finish. Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher and Michael Dinan (all USA) secured second place on the Petit Le Mans podium in the #96 BMW M4 GT3.

The #1 BMW M4 GT3 driven by Bryan Sellers, Madison Snow and Corey Lewis (all USA) was involved in an accident that was not their fault.

In the first nine hours, things were looking very promising for us, and at times, we were right up there competing for the lead and a top result. Unfortunately, we were set back in the closing stages due to numerous yellow flags, and we couldn’t achieve the positions we had set out for. This also means we didn’t end up where we had hoped to be in the championship. It was a disappointing conclusion to the season, but we can look ahead positively. In nine races, we made it to the podium five times, which is a great record. A big thank you to everyone who made this possible. Now the work continues at home, and we’re hoping for a strong start to the 2024 season in Daytona.”\n\nBobby Rahal, Team Principal BMW M Team RLL: “Overall, the season was pretty successful. We had five podiums, including the victory at Watkins Glen. When we look back where we were a year ago it has been crazy and we reacted well to the challenges we had.

Now we are looking forward to next season and it will be a very exciting year.”\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8): “So Petit Le Mans is in the books. It was definitely not the result we wanted and not the result we could have gotten. We just did not play it aggressive enough at the end when it counted, unfortunately. I feel sorry for the guys.

The highlight is the world premiere of two exclusive JCW showcars, created as part of an exciting collaboration.\n\nMINI Pavillion: MINI unveils exclusive JCW showcars.MINI's racing background is not only evident from its recent success at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring: motorsport has been part of the brand's essence from the very beginning.

From a distance of 164 metres, Gillman holed out with a 4-hybrid, marking the first ace of her professional career and winning a BMW 740Li XDrive.\n\nThree years later, something unparalleled happened at the Oak Valley Country Club. The BMW Group has been involved in international professional golf since 1989, but what occurred at the 2022 BMW Ladies Championship had never been seen before when two Hole-in-One Awards were won on the same day. During round three of the BMW Ladies Championship, South Korean Na Yeon Choi was rewarded for her dream shot on the 12th hole with a BMW X7 xDrive40i. A short while later, cheers rang round the course again, as Thailand’s Ariya Jutanugarn aced the 17th to win a BMW 740i.\n\nSince that ‘Super-Saturday’ in October 2022, no other BMW professional tournament around the world has seen such a spectacular double. The BMW Ladies Championship this weekend continues to hold the possibility of making golf history once again.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i7 eDrive50: combined energy consumption: 19.2 kWh/100 km (WLTP); combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2 class: A BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan: combined energy consumption: 18.9-18.8 kWh/100 km (WLTP); combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2 class: A"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Production will begin in August 2023 at BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in the USA. Scheduled for the same timeframe is an exclusive edition of the range-topping model limited to 500 examples and featuring an exterior paint finish in BMW Individual Frozen Carbon Black metallic.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red will celebrate its world premiere at the Auto Shanghai international motor show in April 2023. China is one of the most important sales regions for the BMW XM Label Red, alongside the USA and the Middle East. It can be ordered from dealers from 28 April 2023.\n\nM HYBRID system with top-level and precisely judged performance.\n\nThe M HYBRID system in the BMW XM Label Red demonstrates the intoxicating effect of drive system electrification in high-performance models from BMW M GmbH in impressive style. The precisely honed interplay of the electric motor and V8 engine ensures an instantaneous delivery of power that then builds emphatically and continues unabated into the highest reaches of the rev range. This combination of combustion engine and electric motor matches the drive concept of the new BMW M Hybrid V8 endurance racing car, which made a successful debut in the 24 Hours of Daytona race in the North American IMSA series this year and is set to line up in events including the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2024.\n\nWith a system output increased to 550 kW/748 hp, the new top-of-the-line model outperforms the standard BMW XM produced since December 2022 by 70 kW/95 hp. System torque is up by 200 Nm (147 lb-ft) and now peaks at 1,000 Nm (737 lb-ft). Power is channelled to the road by the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. In conjunction with a model-specific composition of chassis technology and fast-acting, high-precision powertrain and chassis control, this creates a unique performance experience with dynamism and agility at a whole new level.\n\nV8 engine with cutting-edge M TwinPower Turbo technology and classical high-revving character.\n\nThe M HYBRID system of the BMW XM Label Red blends the future-focused virtues of electrification with the traditional qualities of a high-revving eight-cylinder combustion engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology. The latest generation of the V8 stands out with its extremely rapid power delivery, increased efficiency and minimised emissions. As well as a cross-bank exhaust manifold, it also features a reinforced crankshaft drive, turbocharging with an electrically controlled blow-off valve, upgraded oil supply and optimised oil separation.\n\nIn the BMW XM Label Red, the V8 makes an even greater contribution to the system output generated in tandem with the electric motor. It produces its maximum output of 430 kW/585 hp at 5,600 rpm. Peak torque is 750 Nm (553 lb-ft) – an increase of 100 Nm (74 lb-ft) over the version of the engine in the standard BMW XM – and is on tap across an extremely wide rev band from 1,800 to 5,400 rpm.\n\nWith two electronically controlled and continuously adjustable flaps, the sports exhaust system of the BMW XM Label Red provides an emotionally rich accompaniment to the engine’s power delivery with a vibrancy and energy not normally associated with an eight-cylinder unit. The engine sound therefore has a very distinctive quality, as do the two pairs of dual tailpipes, with the individual pipes arranged one above the other.\n\nInstantaneous power delivery: electric motor with innovative pre-gearing stage.\n\nLike the V8 engine, the electric motor of the M HYBRID system also employs innovative technology to deliver a noticeable increase in pulling power. The permanently excited synchronous motor is integrated into the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission together with its power electronics and, in the now familiar style of electric motors, responds to just slight movements of the accelerator with instantaneous power delivery.\n\nThe electric motor contributes up to 145 kW/197 hp to the maximum system output of the BMW XM Label Red and develops nominal torque of 280 Nm (206 lb-ft). A pre-gearing stage patented by BMW is used to increase the torque produced by the motor to an effective maximum of 450 Nm (332 lb-ft) at the transmission input for the motor. In this way, the compact motor is able to provide the sort of torque boost that could normally only be achieved using a far larger and heavier unit.\n\nThe improved build-up of power resulting from the pre-gearing stage between the electric motor’s rotor and the transmission’s input shaft can be clearly felt, both when accelerating off the line and when putting in a quick burst of speed. Combined with the optimised power delivery of the V8 engine and its high-revving character, this produces performance of rare authority and composure. The BMW XM Label Red needs just 3.8 seconds to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph). Its top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), but rises to 290 km/h (180 mph) on cars with the optional M Driver’s Package.\n\nPowerful high-voltage battery, BMW IconicSounds Electric, Combined Charging Unit and predictive heat management.\n\nThe motor draws its energy from a high-voltage lithium-ion battery integrated into the underbody area, which is a product of fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology. The lithium-ion battery stands out with its high energy density at a cell and battery pack level. It provides a constant flow of power across a wide temperature range and even under the heavy loads brought by a particularly sporty driving style. It has a usable energy content of 25.7 kWh. Together with the electric motor’s excellent efficiency and the system of intelligent energy management, this enables an electric range of 75 – 83 kilometres (47 – 52 miles) in the WLTP cycle.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red can therefore complete not only journeys around town but also cross-country routes locally emission-free and almost silently. The top speed achievable in pure electric mode is 140 km/h (87 mph). The power delivery of the electric motor also gains a soundtrack of its own, in the form of the BMW IconicSounds Electric developed as part of a collaboration between the BMW Group and film score composer Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe Combined Charging Unit of the M HYBRID system enables AC charging at up to 7.4 kW. This means the high-voltage battery can be replenished from zero to 100 per cent charge in 4.25 hours. Predictive heat management reduces charging times by judiciously warming or cooling the battery. Supplied as standard are both the Flexible Fast Charger for use with domestic or industrial sockets and the charging cable Professional. This mode 3 cable for topping up at public charging stations can be kept in a suitably stylish and exclusive weekend-type bag and secured in the boot area using a crash-protective carabiner-belt combination.\n\nSupreme traction, captivating performance: M xDrive and M Sport differential.\n\nThe M xDrive all-wheel-drive system channels the power generated by the combustion engine and electric motor between all four wheels precisely, quickly and as required at all times. The system has a rear-biased setup, which enhances the agility of the BMW XM Label Red and is particularly pronounced in 4WD Sport mode. When the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system has been fully disengaged, the traction-optimised 4WD Sand mode – conceived specifically for driving over dunes and similar surfaces – can be activated via the M Setup menu.\n\nBuilding on the work of the M xDrive system is an electronically controlled differential lock in the rear axle, which further enhances traction, agility and directional stability. The M Sport differential brings a need-based and fully variable distribution of drive torque between the left and right rear wheels.\n\nModel-specific chassis tuning, integrated transverse dynamics management.\n\nThe most powerful road-legal BMW M car ever made impresses not only with the unique power delivery of its M HYBRID system, but also with the breadth of its driving attributes, which enthral and delight time after time. The BMW XM Label Red rises to every challenge with unshakable poise and assurance, whether demonstrating its manifestly sporty performance credentials, cruising along in leisurely fashion (with zero local emissions if desired), inviting its occupants to relax in comfort on long trips or venturing off road. The car’s sophisticated chassis technology gives it an extraordinary spread of attributes, from dynamism to long-distance comfort, and is adapted to the bespoke performance characteristics of the drive system with the precision for which BMW M models are renowned.\n\nStandard equipment for the BMW XM Label Red includes adaptive M suspension Professional – featuring electronically controlled dampers and active roll stabilisation with Active Roll Comfort to eliminate body roll on one side of the vehicle – and Integral Active Steering. The M Sport braking system comprises six-piston, fixed-calliper brakes at the front and single-piston, floating-calliper units at the rear. It teams with the latest-generation integrated braking system, which ensures the stopping power generated by recuperation and the friction brake is combined with great precision, and which also presents the driver with two pedal feel settings.\n\nLike the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, the M Sport differential, active roll stabilisation and the steering’s control systems, the near-actuator wheel slip limitation tech integrated into the engine management and the Performance Control function are networked with the central transverse dynamics management. The integrated application of all powertrain and chassis systems together with the fine-tuning carried out on varying types of road – from urban driving to country roads and motorways – with the help of BMW M GmbH’s racing expertise has resulted in a well-resolved driving experience in every situation and with every configuration.\n\nExtroverted design with exclusive details.\n\nStylistically as well as technically, the BMW XM Label Red takes the first model since the legendary BMW M1 to be conceived solely as a high-performance car from BMW M GmbH into even more exclusive territory. The muscular proportions of a dynamic Sports Activity Vehicle converge with an extrovert exterior design featuring large surfaces, clear lines and a front-end look reserved for luxury-class BMW models. And added to the mix here are design accents underscoring the singular character of the BMW XM Label Red as a car focused on achieving the highest peaks of performance.\n\nThe distinguishing features of the performance-maximising XM variant include an accent band in Toronto Red metallic, although a black accent band also can be specified. The use of red also extends to the model badges and the wheel inserts. The BMW XM Label Red is fitted as standard with 21-inch light-alloy wheels. The surrounds for the BMW M kidney grille and diffuser elements come in Black high-gloss.\n\nThe spectrum of exterior paint shades available for the new model comprises one solid and eight metallic variants. Customers can also choose from more than 50 BMW Individual special paint finishes, including the new BMW Individual Urban Green, BMW Individual Petrol Mica metallic, BMW Individual Anglesey Green metallic and BMW Individual Sepia metallic. The new BMW Individual Visualizer (at is available for the first time from the start of orders for the BMW XM Label Red to help customers with the paint selection process. The car is depicted extremely realistically in the paint finish selected by the customer against the backdrop of BMW M Town. Here, it can be viewed from various angles and with the aid of 360-degree video.\n\nThe limited-edition variant of the BMW XM Label Red – only 500 examples of which will be released globally – maximises the exclusivity factor with even more expressive styling. Toronto Red metallic for the BMW M kidney grille surround and rear diffuser insert create additional design cues that combine with a body paint finish in BMW Individual Frozen Carbon Black metallic. The contrast of the gloss colour accents against shimmering matt surfaces ensures the exterior of the BMW XM Label Red has a particularly enthralling effect.\n\nA black/red colour scheme also brings a visually appealing and sporting flavour to the interior of the BMW XM Label Red. The distinctive three-dimensional headliner and the trim for the body pillars have black surfaces. Red is used to bring an extra sense of exclusivity to the diamond-shaped upper sections of the backrests and the integrated head restraints of the seats for the driver and front passenger and the outer rear seats. This is complemented by red contrast stitching for the black surfaces of the seats, instrument panel, door trim and centre console, and the likewise red accents for the air vents. Among the other exclusive features of the BMW XM Label Red interior are a red “XM” badge below the control display and an interior trim strip in Carbon Fibre satin effect with red and blue accent threads highlighting this as an M car. Inside the limited-edition variant of the Label Red, customers will find a plaque below the control display reading “1 of 500”.\n\nSports car cockpit with BMW Curved Display; M Lounge in the rear.\n\nM multifunction seats, knee pads, M-specific content on the BMW Curved Display and the standard-fitted BMW head-up display, the signature M gear selector lever and an M-specific control panel on the centre console are the headline features of a sports car-style cockpit optimised to deliver a richly engaging performance experience on board. The M Hybrid button is used to select the desired operating mode for the drive system, while the Setup button provides direct access to the configuration of the powertrain, chassis, steering, braking system and M xDrive, as well as allowing the level of brake energy recuperation to be adjusted. The M leather steering wheel has trim elements in Black Chrome, plus M buttons and gearshift paddles with carbon inlays whose plus and minus symbols are in red. An exclusive special feature of the BMW XM Label Red is the symbol identifying Boost Mode on the left-hand shift paddle.\n\nA generous feeling of space, high-quality materials and extravagant design transform the rear of the BMW XM Label Red into an exclusive M Lounge. Optionally heated backrests that extend well into the sides of the cabin and cushions in Merino leather with red contrast stitching and an “XM” badge offer passengers luxurious levels of comfort. The sculptural headliner is quite unique with its three-dimensional prism structure, photo mount-style border and 100 LED units for illumination. Ambient lighting, four-zone automatic climate control, the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System and the Travel & Comfort System are all standard features too, while the options list includes the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System with 1,475-watt amplifier and four additional speakers in the roof area.\n\nAdvanced driver assistance systems; BMW Live Cockpit Professional as standard.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red offers customers a wide selection of advanced systems for automated driving and parking. Among the technologies fitted as standard is the Driving Assistant, which comprises Front Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning including lane return with steering assistance, the Evasion Assistant, Alertness Assistant and the Speed Limit Info system. The optional Driving Assistant Professional brings Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function together with features such as the Steering and Lane Control Assistant, traffic light recognition, automatic Speed Limit Assist and Active Navigation.\n\nParking Assistant Plus is also part of standard specification. Alongside, the Reversing Assistant, this system adds Parking View, front and rear Panorama View and 3D View to the repertoire of functions.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red comes as standard with the BMW Live Cockpit Professional, which brings with it the latest generation of the BMW iDrive multi-sensory vehicle experience, here based on an M-specific version of BMW Operating System 8. With the fully digital screen grouping and the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, the new BMW iDrive has been deliberately geared towards touch control and gesture control as well as dialogue using natural language.\n\nThe BMW Live Cockpit Professional also includes the cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system. The optional BMW Digital Key Plus enables customers to lock and unlock the BMW XM Label Red using their Apple iPhone by means of security-enhanced ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology. Smartphone integration for Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™, the personalised BMW ID functionality and an eSIM designed for 5G mobile technology are also available for use.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW XM Label Red: Petrol consumption combined: 1.7 – 1.6 l/100 km [166.2 – 176.6 mpg imp]; electric power consumption combined: 34.5 – 33.0 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 39 – 35 g/km in the WLTP cycle; provisional values; figures for the NEDC cycle: – BMW XM: Petrol consumption combined: 1.7 – 1.6 l/100 km [166.2 – 176.6 mpg imp]; electric power consumption combined: 34.5 – 33.0 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 39 – 35 g/km in the WLTP cycle; figures for the NEDC cycle: –"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "More powerful, more exclusive, more extravagant: Just a few months after production got underway of the new BMW XM (petrol consumption combined: 1.7 – 1.6 l/100 km [166.2 – 176.6 mpg imp]; electric power consumption combined: 34.5 – 33.0 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 39 – 35 g/km in the WLTP cycle; figures for the NEDC cycle: – ), BMW M GmbH presents the flagship version of its first-ever high-performance car with an electrified drive system.

The permanently excited synchronous motor is integrated into the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission together with its power electronics and, in the now familiar style of electric motors, responds to just slight movements of the accelerator with instantaneous power delivery.\n\nThe electric motor contributes up to 145 kW/197 hp to the maximum system output of the BMW XM Label Red and develops nominal torque of 280 Nm (206 lb-ft). A pre-gearing stage patented by BMW is used to increase the torque produced by the motor to an effective maximum of 450 Nm (332 lb-ft) at the transmission input for the motor. In this way, the compact motor is able to provide the sort of torque boost that could normally only be achieved using a far larger and heavier unit.\n\nThe improved build-up of power resulting from the pre-gearing stage between the electric motor’s rotor and the transmission’s input shaft can be clearly felt, both when accelerating off the line and when putting in a quick burst of speed. Combined with the optimised power delivery of the V8 engine and its high-revving character, this produces performance of rare authority and composure. The BMW XM Label Red needs just 3.8 seconds to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph). Its top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), but rises to 290 km/h (180 mph) on cars with the optional M Driver’s Package.\n\nPowerful high-voltage battery, BMW IconicSounds Electric, Combined Charging Unit and predictive heat management.\n\nThe motor draws its energy from a high-voltage lithium-ion battery integrated into the underbody area, which is a product of fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology. The lithium-ion battery stands out with its high energy density at a cell and battery pack level. It provides a constant flow of power across a wide temperature range and even under the heavy loads brought by a particularly sporty driving style. It has a usable energy content of 25.7 kWh. Together with the electric motor’s excellent efficiency and the system of intelligent energy management, this enables an electric range of 75 – 83 kilometres (47 – 52 miles) in the WLTP cycle.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red can therefore complete not only journeys around town but also cross-country routes locally emission-free and almost silently. The top speed achievable in pure electric mode is 140 km/h (87 mph). The power delivery of the electric motor also gains a soundtrack of its own, in the form of the BMW IconicSounds Electric developed as part of a collaboration between the BMW Group and film score composer Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe Combined Charging Unit of the M HYBRID system enables AC charging at up to 7.4 kW. This means the high-voltage battery can be replenished from zero to 100 per cent charge in 4.25 hours. Predictive heat management reduces charging times by judiciously warming or cooling the battery. Supplied as standard are both the Flexible Fast Charger for use with domestic or industrial sockets and the charging cable Professional. This mode 3 cable for topping up at public charging stations can be kept in a suitably stylish and exclusive weekend-type bag and secured in the boot area using a crash-protective carabiner-belt combination.\n\nSupreme traction, captivating performance: M xDrive and M Sport differential.\n\nThe M xDrive all-wheel-drive system channels the power generated by the combustion engine and electric motor between all four wheels precisely, quickly and as required at all times. The system has a rear-biased setup, which enhances the agility of the BMW XM Label Red and is particularly pronounced in 4WD Sport mode. When the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system has been fully disengaged, the traction-optimised 4WD Sand mode – conceived specifically for driving over dunes and similar surfaces – can be activated via the M Setup menu.\n\nBuilding on the work of the M xDrive system is an electronically controlled differential lock in the rear axle, which further enhances traction, agility and directional stability. The M Sport differential brings a need-based and fully variable distribution of drive torque between the left and right rear wheels.\n\nModel-specific chassis tuning, integrated transverse dynamics management.\n\nThe most powerful road-legal BMW M car ever made impresses not only with the unique power delivery of its M HYBRID system, but also with the breadth of its driving attributes, which enthral and delight time after time. The BMW XM Label Red rises to every challenge with unshakable poise and assurance, whether demonstrating its manifestly sporty performance credentials, cruising along in leisurely fashion (with zero local emissions if desired), inviting its occupants to relax in comfort on long trips or venturing off road. The car’s sophisticated chassis technology gives it an extraordinary spread of attributes, from dynamism to long-distance comfort, and is adapted to the bespoke performance characteristics of the drive system with the precision for which BMW M models are renowned.\n\nStandard equipment for the BMW XM Label Red includes adaptive M suspension Professional – featuring electronically controlled dampers and active roll stabilisation with Active Roll Comfort to eliminate body roll on one side of the vehicle – and Integral Active Steering. The M Sport braking system comprises six-piston, fixed-calliper brakes at the front and single-piston, floating-calliper units at the rear. It teams with the latest-generation integrated braking system, which ensures the stopping power generated by recuperation and the friction brake is combined with great precision, and which also presents the driver with two pedal feel settings.\n\nLike the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, the M Sport differential, active roll stabilisation and the steering’s control systems, the near-actuator wheel slip limitation tech integrated into the engine management and the Performance Control function are networked with the central transverse dynamics management. The integrated application of all powertrain and chassis systems together with the fine-tuning carried out on varying types of road – from urban driving to country roads and motorways – with the help of BMW M GmbH’s racing expertise has resulted in a well-resolved driving experience in every situation and with every configuration.\n\nExtroverted design with exclusive details.\n\nStylistically as well as technically, the BMW XM Label Red takes the first model since the legendary BMW M1 to be conceived solely as a high-performance car from BMW M GmbH into even more exclusive territory. The muscular proportions of a dynamic Sports Activity Vehicle converge with an extrovert exterior design featuring large surfaces, clear lines and a front-end look reserved for luxury-class BMW models. And added to the mix here are design accents underscoring the singular character of the BMW XM Label Red as a car focused on achieving the highest peaks of performance.\n\nThe distinguishing features of the performance-maximising XM variant include an accent band in Toronto Red metallic, although a black accent band also can be specified. The use of red also extends to the model badges and the wheel inserts. The BMW XM Label Red is fitted as standard with 21-inch light-alloy wheels. The surrounds for the BMW M kidney grille and diffuser elements come in Black high-gloss.\n\nThe spectrum of exterior paint shades available for the new model comprises one solid and eight metallic variants. Customers can also choose from more than 50 BMW Individual special paint finishes, including the new BMW Individual Urban Green, BMW Individual Petrol Mica metallic, BMW Individual Anglesey Green metallic and BMW Individual Sepia metallic. The new BMW Individual Visualizer (at is available for the first time from the start of orders for the BMW XM Label Red to help customers with the paint selection process. The car is depicted extremely realistically in the paint finish selected by the customer against the backdrop of BMW M Town. Here, it can be viewed from various angles and with the aid of 360-degree video.\n\nThe limited-edition variant of the BMW XM Label Red – only 500 examples of which will be released globally – maximises the exclusivity factor with even more expressive styling. Toronto Red metallic for the BMW M kidney grille surround and rear diffuser insert create additional design cues that combine with a body paint finish in BMW Individual Frozen Carbon Black metallic. The contrast of the gloss colour accents against shimmering matt surfaces ensures the exterior of the BMW XM Label Red has a particularly enthralling effect.\n\nA black/red colour scheme also brings a visually appealing and sporting flavour to the interior of the BMW XM Label Red. The distinctive three-dimensional headliner and the trim for the body pillars have black surfaces. Red is used to bring an extra sense of exclusivity to the diamond-shaped upper sections of the backrests and the integrated head restraints of the seats for the driver and front passenger and the outer rear seats. This is complemented by red contrast stitching for the black surfaces of the seats, instrument panel, door trim and centre console, and the likewise red accents for the air vents. Among the other exclusive features of the BMW XM Label Red interior are a red “XM” badge below the control display and an interior trim strip in Carbon Fibre satin effect with red and blue accent threads highlighting this as an M car. Inside the limited-edition variant of the Label Red, customers will find a plaque below the control display reading “1 of 500”.\n\nSports car cockpit with BMW Curved Display; M Lounge in the rear.\n\nM multifunction seats, knee pads, M-specific content on the BMW Curved Display and the standard-fitted BMW head-up display, the signature M gear selector lever and an M-specific control panel on the centre console are the headline features of a sports car-style cockpit optimised to deliver a richly engaging performance experience on board. The M Hybrid button is used to select the desired operating mode for the drive system, while the Setup button provides direct access to the configuration of the powertrain, chassis, steering, braking system and M xDrive, as well as allowing the level of brake energy recuperation to be adjusted. The M leather steering wheel has trim elements in Black Chrome, plus M buttons and gearshift paddles with carbon inlays whose plus and minus symbols are in red. An exclusive special feature of the BMW XM Label Red is the symbol identifying Boost Mode on the left-hand shift paddle.\n\nA generous feeling of space, high-quality materials and extravagant design transform the rear of the BMW XM Label Red into an exclusive M Lounge. Optionally heated backrests that extend well into the sides of the cabin and cushions in Merino leather with red contrast stitching and an “XM” badge offer passengers luxurious levels of comfort.

The precisely honed interplay of the electric motor and V8 engine ensures an instantaneous delivery of power that then builds emphatically and continues unabated into the highest reaches of the rev range. This combination of combustion engine and electric motor matches the drive concept of the new BMW M Hybrid V8 endurance racing car, which made a successful debut in the 24 Hours of Daytona race in the North American IMSA series this year and is set to line up in events including the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2024.\n\nWith a system output increased to 550 kW/748 hp, the new top-of-the-line model outperforms the standard BMW XM produced since December 2022 by 70 kW/95 hp. System torque is up by 200 Nm (147 lb-ft) and now peaks at 1,000 Nm (737 lb-ft). Power is channelled to the road by the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. In conjunction with a model-specific composition of chassis technology and fast-acting, high-precision powertrain and chassis control, this creates a unique performance experience with dynamism and agility at a whole new level.\n\nV8 engine with cutting-edge M TwinPower Turbo technology and classical high-revving character.\n\nThe M HYBRID system of the BMW XM Label Red blends the future-focused virtues of electrification with the traditional qualities of a high-revving eight-cylinder combustion engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology. The latest generation of the V8 stands out with its extremely rapid power delivery, increased efficiency and minimised emissions. As well as a cross-bank exhaust manifold, it also features a reinforced crankshaft drive, turbocharging with an electrically controlled blow-off valve, upgraded oil supply and optimised oil separation.\n\nIn the BMW XM Label Red, the V8 makes an even greater contribution to the system output generated in tandem with the electric motor. It produces its maximum output of 430 kW/585 hp at 5,600 rpm. Peak torque is 750 Nm (553 lb-ft) – an increase of 100 Nm (74 lb-ft) over the version of the engine in the standard BMW XM – and is on tap across an extremely wide rev band from 1,800 to 5,400 rpm.\n\nWith two electronically controlled and continuously adjustable flaps, the sports exhaust system of the BMW XM Label Red provides an emotionally rich accompaniment to the engine’s power delivery with a vibrancy and energy not normally associated with an eight-cylinder unit.

Peak torque is 750 Nm (553 lb-ft) – an increase of 100 Nm (74 lb-ft) over the version of the engine in the standard BMW XM – and is on tap across an extremely wide rev band from 1,800 to 5,400 rpm.\n\nWith two electronically controlled and continuously adjustable flaps, the sports exhaust system of the BMW XM Label Red provides an emotionally rich accompaniment to the engine’s power delivery with a vibrancy and energy not normally associated with an eight-cylinder unit. The engine sound therefore has a very distinctive quality, as do the two pairs of dual tailpipes, with the individual pipes arranged one above the other.\n\nInstantaneous power delivery: electric motor with innovative pre-gearing stage.\n\nLike the V8 engine, the electric motor of the M HYBRID system also employs innovative technology to deliver a noticeable increase in pulling power. The permanently excited synchronous motor is integrated into the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission together with its power electronics and, in the now familiar style of electric motors, responds to just slight movements of the accelerator with instantaneous power delivery.\n\nThe electric motor contributes up to 145 kW/197 hp to the maximum system output of the BMW XM Label Red and develops nominal torque of 280 Nm (206 lb-ft). A pre-gearing stage patented by BMW is used to increase the torque produced by the motor to an effective maximum of 450 Nm (332 lb-ft) at the transmission input for the motor. In this way, the compact motor is able to provide the sort of torque boost that could normally only be achieved using a far larger and heavier unit.\n\nThe improved build-up of power resulting from the pre-gearing stage between the electric motor’s rotor and the transmission’s input shaft can be clearly felt, both when accelerating off the line and when putting in a quick burst of speed. Combined with the optimised power delivery of the V8 engine and its high-revving character, this produces performance of rare authority and composure. The BMW XM Label Red needs just 3.8 seconds to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph). Its top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), but rises to 290 km/h (180 mph) on cars with the optional M Driver’s Package.\n\nPowerful high-voltage battery, BMW IconicSounds Electric, Combined Charging Unit and predictive heat management.\n\nThe motor draws its energy from a high-voltage lithium-ion battery integrated into the underbody area, which is a product of fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology. The lithium-ion battery stands out with its high energy density at a cell and battery pack level. It provides a constant flow of power across a wide temperature range and even under the heavy loads brought by a particularly sporty driving style. It has a usable energy content of 25.7 kWh. Together with the electric motor’s excellent efficiency and the system of intelligent energy management, this enables an electric range of 75 – 83 kilometres (47 – 52 miles) in the WLTP cycle.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red can therefore complete not only journeys around town but also cross-country routes locally emission-free and almost silently. The top speed achievable in pure electric mode is 140 km/h (87 mph). The power delivery of the electric motor also gains a soundtrack of its own, in the form of the BMW IconicSounds Electric developed as part of a collaboration between the BMW Group and film score composer Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe Combined Charging Unit of the M HYBRID system enables AC charging at up to 7.4 kW. This means the high-voltage battery can be replenished from zero to 100 per cent charge in 4.25 hours. Predictive heat management reduces charging times by judiciously warming or cooling the battery. Supplied as standard are both the Flexible Fast Charger for use with domestic or industrial sockets and the charging cable Professional. This mode 3 cable for topping up at public charging stations can be kept in a suitably stylish and exclusive weekend-type bag and secured in the boot area using a crash-protective carabiner-belt combination.\n\nSupreme traction, captivating performance: M xDrive and M Sport differential.\n\nThe M xDrive all-wheel-drive system channels the power generated by the combustion engine and electric motor between all four wheels precisely, quickly and as required at all times. The system has a rear-biased setup, which enhances the agility of the BMW XM Label Red and is particularly pronounced in 4WD Sport mode. When the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system has been fully disengaged, the traction-optimised 4WD Sand mode – conceived specifically for driving over dunes and similar surfaces – can be activated via the M Setup menu.\n\nBuilding on the work of the M xDrive system is an electronically controlled differential lock in the rear axle, which further enhances traction, agility and directional stability. The M Sport differential brings a need-based and fully variable distribution of drive torque between the left and right rear wheels.\n\nModel-specific chassis tuning, integrated transverse dynamics management.\n\nThe most powerful road-legal BMW M car ever made impresses not only with the unique power delivery of its M HYBRID system, but also with the breadth of its driving attributes, which enthral and delight time after time. The BMW XM Label Red rises to every challenge with unshakable poise and assurance, whether demonstrating its manifestly sporty performance credentials, cruising along in leisurely fashion (with zero local emissions if desired), inviting its occupants to relax in comfort on long trips or venturing off road. The car’s sophisticated chassis technology gives it an extraordinary spread of attributes, from dynamism to long-distance comfort, and is adapted to the bespoke performance characteristics of the drive system with the precision for which BMW M models are renowned.\n\nStandard equipment for the BMW XM Label Red includes adaptive M suspension Professional – featuring electronically controlled dampers and active roll stabilisation with Active Roll Comfort to eliminate body roll on one side of the vehicle – and Integral Active Steering. The M Sport braking system comprises six-piston, fixed-calliper brakes at the front and single-piston, floating-calliper units at the rear. It teams with the latest-generation integrated braking system, which ensures the stopping power generated by recuperation and the friction brake is combined with great precision, and which also presents the driver with two pedal feel settings.\n\nLike the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, the M Sport differential, active roll stabilisation and the steering’s control systems, the near-actuator wheel slip limitation tech integrated into the engine management and the Performance Control function are networked with the central transverse dynamics management. The integrated application of all powertrain and chassis systems together with the fine-tuning carried out on varying types of road – from urban driving to country roads and motorways – with the help of BMW M GmbH’s racing expertise has resulted in a well-resolved driving experience in every situation and with every configuration.\n\nExtroverted design with exclusive details.\n\nStylistically as well as technically, the BMW XM Label Red takes the first model since the legendary BMW M1 to be conceived solely as a high-performance car from BMW M GmbH into even more exclusive territory. The muscular proportions of a dynamic Sports Activity Vehicle converge with an extrovert exterior design featuring large surfaces, clear lines and a front-end look reserved for luxury-class BMW models. And added to the mix here are design accents underscoring the singular character of the BMW XM Label Red as a car focused on achieving the highest peaks of performance.\n\nThe distinguishing features of the performance-maximising XM variant include an accent band in Toronto Red metallic, although a black accent band also can be specified. The use of red also extends to the model badges and the wheel inserts. The BMW XM Label Red is fitted as standard with 21-inch light-alloy wheels. The surrounds for the BMW M kidney grille and diffuser elements come in Black high-gloss.\n\nThe spectrum of exterior paint shades available for the new model comprises one solid and eight metallic variants. Customers can also choose from more than 50 BMW Individual special paint finishes, including the new BMW Individual Urban Green, BMW Individual Petrol Mica metallic, BMW Individual Anglesey Green metallic and BMW Individual Sepia metallic. The new BMW Individual Visualizer (at is available for the first time from the start of orders for the BMW XM Label Red to help customers with the paint selection process. The car is depicted extremely realistically in the paint finish selected by the customer against the backdrop of BMW M Town. Here, it can be viewed from various angles and with the aid of 360-degree video.\n\nThe limited-edition variant of the BMW XM Label Red – only 500 examples of which will be released globally – maximises the exclusivity factor with even more expressive styling. Toronto Red metallic for the BMW M kidney grille surround and rear diffuser insert create additional design cues that combine with a body paint finish in BMW Individual Frozen Carbon Black metallic. The contrast of the gloss colour accents against shimmering matt surfaces ensures the exterior of the BMW XM Label Red has a particularly enthralling effect.\n\nA black/red colour scheme also brings a visually appealing and sporting flavour to the interior of the BMW XM Label Red. The distinctive three-dimensional headliner and the trim for the body pillars have black surfaces. Red is used to bring an extra sense of exclusivity to the diamond-shaped upper sections of the backrests and the integrated head restraints of the seats for the driver and front passenger and the outer rear seats. This is complemented by red contrast stitching for the black surfaces of the seats, instrument panel, door trim and centre console, and the likewise red accents for the air vents. Among the other exclusive features of the BMW XM Label Red interior are a red “XM” badge below the control display and an interior trim strip in Carbon Fibre satin effect with red and blue accent threads highlighting this as an M car. Inside the limited-edition variant of the Label Red, customers will find a plaque below the control display reading “1 of 500”.\n\nSports car cockpit with BMW Curved Display; M Lounge in the rear.\n\nM multifunction seats, knee pads, M-specific content on the BMW Curved Display and the standard-fitted BMW head-up display, the signature M gear selector lever and an M-specific control panel on the centre console are the headline features of a sports car-style cockpit optimised to deliver a richly engaging performance experience on board. The M Hybrid button is used to select the desired operating mode for the drive system, while the Setup button provides direct access to the configuration of the powertrain, chassis, steering, braking system and M xDrive, as well as allowing the level of brake energy recuperation to be adjusted. The M leather steering wheel has trim elements in Black Chrome, plus M buttons and gearshift paddles with carbon inlays whose plus and minus symbols are in red. An exclusive special feature of the BMW XM Label Red is the symbol identifying Boost Mode on the left-hand shift paddle.\n\nA generous feeling of space, high-quality materials and extravagant design transform the rear of the BMW XM Label Red into an exclusive M Lounge. Optionally heated backrests that extend well into the sides of the cabin and cushions in Merino leather with red contrast stitching and an “XM” badge offer passengers luxurious levels of comfort. The sculptural headliner is quite unique with its three-dimensional prism structure, photo mount-style border and 100 LED units for illumination. Ambient lighting, four-zone automatic climate control, the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System and the Travel & Comfort System are all standard features too, while the options list includes the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System with 1,475-watt amplifier and four additional speakers in the roof area.\n\nAdvanced driver assistance systems; BMW Live Cockpit Professional as standard.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red offers customers a wide selection of advanced systems for automated driving and parking. Among the technologies fitted as standard is the Driving Assistant, which comprises Front Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning including lane return with steering assistance, the Evasion Assistant, Alertness Assistant and the Speed Limit Info system. The optional Driving Assistant Professional brings Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function together with features such as the Steering and Lane Control Assistant, traffic light recognition, automatic Speed Limit Assist and Active Navigation.\n\nParking Assistant Plus is also part of standard specification. Alongside, the Reversing Assistant, this system adds Parking View, front and rear Panorama View and 3D View to the repertoire of functions.\n\nThe BMW XM Label Red comes as standard with the BMW Live Cockpit Professional, which brings with it the latest generation of the BMW iDrive multi-sensory vehicle experience, here based on an M-specific version of BMW Operating System 8. With the fully digital screen grouping and the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, the new BMW iDrive has been deliberately geared towards touch control and gesture control as well as dialogue using natural language.\n\nThe BMW Live Cockpit Professional also includes the cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system. The optional BMW Digital Key Plus enables customers to lock and unlock the BMW XM Label Red using their Apple iPhone by means of security-enhanced ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology. Smartphone integration for Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™, the personalised BMW ID functionality and an eSIM designed for 5G mobile technology are also available for use.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW XM Label Red: Petrol consumption combined: 1.7 – 1.6 l/100 km [166.2 – 176.6 mpg imp]; electric power consumption combined: 34.5 – 33.0 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 39 – 35 g/km in the WLTP cycle; provisional values; figures for the NEDC cycle: – BMW XM: Petrol consumption combined: 1.7 – 1.6 l/100 km [166.2 – 176.6 mpg imp]; electric power consumption combined: 34.5 – 33.0 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 39 – 35 g/km in the WLTP cycle; figures for the NEDC cycle: –"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Kit"}]}

The final round of this season’s FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Phillip Island, Australia, was overshadowed by a serious accident involving Eugene Laverty (IRL). The racer from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team crashed in race two on Sunday and was hit by another rider. Laverty was initially taken to the Medical Centre. He was stable, responsive and had feeling in all extremities. He then was flown to a Melbourne hospital for further examinations. So far, a fracture in his hip was diagnosed.\n\nOverall, it proved to be a difficult final weekend for BMW Motorrad Motorsport in southern Australia. Constant weather changes made getting the right set-up and tyre selection a real challenge. Having rained beforehand, conditions were dry for the Superpole at noon on Saturday. Scott Redding (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team was the best-placed BMW rider in twelfth, followed by Laverty in 13th. Michael van der Mark (NED / BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) ended qualifying in 15th place, while Loris Baz (FRA / Bonovo action BMW Racing Team) was 18th.\n\nThe track was wet for the start of race one on Saturday afternoon but dried quickly during the race, with the entire field pitting to change tyres. Baz made up nine positions and came home ninth to claim another top ten result. Redding was 16th, while Laverty crossed the finish line in 18th place. Van der Mark crashed twice and had to retire.\n\nConditions were similar for the Superpole Race on Sunday morning. Redding, who lined up on wet tyres, came into the pits to switch to intermediates after the warm-up lap. This meant he had to start from the pit lane, but the tyre selection proved to be the right one. Starting from the back of the field, Redding had climbed into sixth place by the end of the ten-lap sprint. Baz, again starting 18th, was tenth and only narrowly missed out on ninth place. Laverty finished 15th. Van der Mark had to come into the pits during the race to switch from wets to slicks, and eventually came home 21st.\n\nRace two on Sunday afternoon began promisingly with Redding sprinting to the front at the start and running second over the opening laps while Laverty found himself eighth after lap one. However, as the race progressed, both riders dropped back through the field before the race was red flagged after Laverty’s accident. Redding came home sixth, Baz tenth, and van der Mark twelfth.\n\nQuotes after the Phillip Island races.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “First and foremost, we wish Eugene a swift recovery. We must wait to see what the further examinations reveal, but we all hope that he is fit again soon. I am so sorry that his final WorldSBK race ended that way. I would also like to thank him for the last three years as a BMW factory rider. However, he will remain with us in a different role with the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team.\n\n“Overall, it was a mixed weekend for us, and the same can be said of the weather. After the races in Mandalika, we arrived here in a positive frame of mind. However, we all struggled to find the right set up on the tyres available on Friday. Qualifying on Saturday was not good either. Michael crashed twice in race one, while the other results were somewhat unsatisfactory. We did however react well to the tricky and changeable weather conditions in the Superpole Race. We didn’t want to take any risks with Michael, however the strategy to start on wets did not pay off. Scott came into the pits straight after the warm-up lap which was the right decision and he raced through the field into sixth place, narrowly missing fifth. Loris and Eugene made the same decision as most other riders while they were still on the grid. Loris just missed out on ninth place by 0.2 seconds and had to start race two from 18th again. Scott took good advantage of sixth place on the grid over the opening laps of race two. It was good to see him in second place. He rode superbly, but we knew that we would not quite be able to match the pace of the front-runners. However, we were able to open a gap to those behind and are satisfied with the performance, Scott performed brilliantly. Our focus now shifts to preparations for the 2023 season.”\n\nScott Redding, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 12 / R01: 16 / SP Race: 6 / R02: 6): “Today was a bit different from the previous days, the weather was again interesting. In the Superpole Race, I gambled on coming in on the warm-up lap and switched to the intermediates which was not bad idea but meant I needed to work my way back through the field. As I started from the pit lane, I lost a lot of time so was probably not the best option, but it was good enough to claim sixth which gave me a second row start for race two. In the second race it was again raining slightly, but we all started with slicks. I got a very good start and was battling at the front for the first five laps but then I had a few tyre issues and managed to take sixth. The race was overshadowed by Eugene’s accident, and I wish him all the best for a speedy recovery!”\n\nLoris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 18 / R01: 9 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 10): “That is not the party we had wanted for Eugene’s last race, but the most important thing is that he is kind of okay. I just hope that he will be back on his feet soon. For me, this Sunday was no better than the rest of the weekend. I was very disappointed after the Superpole Race. The tyre was gone by all the wear. I was in the top nine that determine the grid for race two until three corners from the end but then my front tyre was completely gone. It meant I had to start again from 18th on the grid in race two. That wasn’t easy, but I managed to come back through into the top ten. I had good pace, not enough for seventh or eighth, but it could easily have been ninth. I just lost too much time battling with Michael but at least had fun battling in this last race. It is just so sad as we had planned something for Eugene. I had 50 Dollars in my boot to stop after the chequered flag to drink a beer with Eugene somewhere at the track, so we really have to make this happen next year when we are here. I will send him to somewhere at the track with the scooter and we have a beer. I am just thinking of Eugene now and the race is not important. I just want to thank the team for all their efforts, and we will come back stronger next year.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 15 / R01: DNF / SP Race: 21 / R02: 12): “This Sunday was not ideal. In warm-up this morning, I felt okay but we had a technical issue, so I lost a lot of track time. Then before the Superpole Race, it started to rain really hard. We were on the rain tyres, and I knew the track was drying but I did not expect it to dry that quick. From the first lap I knew it was the wrong decision so changed to slicks and did what I could. In race two, I had an okay start but was in the wrong group. I felt that I could go faster if I could just get past all the other guys. I had some nice battles but towards the end I struggled more and more from the edge of the tyre and couldn’t improve. Unfortunately, Eugene then had the accident. I hope he gets well very soon. Overall, it was a season to forget but we will put it behind us and look forward to the start of the new season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The final round of this season’s FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Phillip Island, Australia, was overshadowed by a serious accident involving Eugene Laverty (IRL).

The final round of this season’s FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Phillip Island, Australia, was overshadowed by a serious accident involving Eugene Laverty (IRL). The racer from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team crashed in race two on Sunday and was hit by another rider. Laverty was initially taken to the Medical Centre. He was stable, responsive and had feeling in all extremities. He then was flown to a Melbourne hospital for further examinations. So far, a fracture in his hip was diagnosed.\n\nOverall, it proved to be a difficult final weekend for BMW Motorrad Motorsport in southern Australia. Constant weather changes made getting the right set-up and tyre selection a real challenge. Having rained beforehand, conditions were dry for the Superpole at noon on Saturday. Scott Redding (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team was the best-placed BMW rider in twelfth, followed by Laverty in 13th. Michael van der Mark (NED / BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) ended qualifying in 15th place, while Loris Baz (FRA / Bonovo action BMW Racing Team) was 18th.\n\nThe track was wet for the start of race one on Saturday afternoon but dried quickly during the race, with the entire field pitting to change tyres. Baz made up nine positions and came home ninth to claim another top ten result. Redding was 16th, while Laverty crossed the finish line in 18th place. Van der Mark crashed twice and had to retire.\n\nConditions were similar for the Superpole Race on Sunday morning. Redding, who lined up on wet tyres, came into the pits to switch to intermediates after the warm-up lap. This meant he had to start from the pit lane, but the tyre selection proved to be the right one. Starting from the back of the field, Redding had climbed into sixth place by the end of the ten-lap sprint. Baz, again starting 18th, was tenth and only narrowly missed out on ninth place. Laverty finished 15th. Van der Mark had to come into the pits during the race to switch from wets to slicks, and eventually came home 21st.\n\nRace two on Sunday afternoon began promisingly with Redding sprinting to the front at the start and running second over the opening laps while Laverty found himself eighth after lap one. However, as the race progressed, both riders dropped back through the field before the race was red flagged after Laverty’s accident. Redding came home sixth, Baz tenth, and van der Mark twelfth.\n\nQuotes after the Phillip Island races.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “First and foremost, we wish Eugene a swift recovery.

This was mainly due to two factors:\n\nIn the case of IBS, numerous markets have to replace the affected parts before cars can be delivered to customers.\n\nThis led to temporary delivery stops that impacted sales and revenues and drove up inventory levels.\n\nIn the third quarter, we fully recognised the necessary provisions for warranty obligations in the high three-digit million-euro range.\n\nLooking forward, we have already made good progress with the implementation of technical measures worldwide and expect to complete them for most cars held in stock by the end of this year.\n\nSo in Q4 we will see volumes well above Q3 and an improved product mix.\n\nSLIDE 3: BMW Group Performance per Q3 2024\n\nLet’s now take a look into the numbers for the third quarter.\n\nAt Group level, revenues were significantly lower than in the prior-year quarter, at 32.4 billion euros.\n\nGroup EBIT totalled 1.7 billion euros in the third quarter.\n\nThe Financial Result was considerably impacted by negative fair value measurement effects and, consequently, Group EBT amounted to 838 million euros between July and September.\n\nThe Group EBT margin for the third quarter came in at 2.6 percent.\n\nYear to date, Group EBT totalled almost 8.9 billion euros, resulting in an EBT margin of 8.4 percent.\n\nThe Automotive EBIT margin was 2.3 percent for the third quarter and 6.6 percent for the year to the end of September.\n\nExcluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 3.5 percent for the quarter and 7.7 percent for the first nine months.\n\nAfter nine months, the BMW Group’s global sales showed a slight year-on-year decrease of 4.5 percent.\n\nThe Balance Sheet of the BMW Group has increased by 11 billion euros since the beginning of the year.\n\nHalf of this increase is driven by the growth of our Financial Services portfolio and thus represents future profit potential.\n\nThe remaining increase is mainly related to temporary inventory build up.\n\nWhile the third quarter results were impacted by extraordinary factors, it is important to highlight the positive aspects of our operational performance:\n\nSLIDE 4: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nMoving to the Automotive Segment.\n\nIn the third quarter, the BMW Group delivered around 541,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a decrease of 13 percent compared to the same quarter of last year.\n\nHowever, our all-electric vehicles continued to perform well: Over 100,000 units were delivered to customers – 10.1 percent more than in the same quarter of last year.\n\nThe share of our all-electric vehicles was 19.1 percent of total sales.\n\nIn fact, more than a quarter of our total sales came from electrified vehicles – that is, BEVs, plus plug-in hybrids.\n\nSegment revenues amounted to around 28 billion euros – which was lower than in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nIn Q3 revenue per unit continues to be at last year’s level.\n\nEBIT for July to the end of September totalled 634 million euros.\n\nThe EBIT margin came in at 2.3 percent for the quarter and 6.6 percent for the year to the end of September.\n\nThat brings me to the next slide with the details of the changes in the operational result.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q3\n\nThe net balance of currency and raw material positions exceeded the previous year by 200 million euros.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the net balance of currency and raw material positions should provide a tailwind of close to one billion euros.\n\nWe expect this to nearly offset the headwinds from material costs.\n\nBut we are seeing additional requests for supply chain support.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model mix and pricing effects negatively impacted EBIT by 2.1 billion euros in the third quarter, compared to the previous year.\n\nAll three elements trended lower year-on-year.\n\nThe health of our dealers’ operations is strategically important to us. Therefore, in Q3, we have implemented measures jointly with our Chinese dealers to support both profitability and liquidity.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by about 100 million euros, compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development reached approximately 6.6 billion euros in the first nine months.\n\nThe R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was at 6.3 percent at the end of September. It is significantly higher than prior year due in part to higher expenditure, but also compounded by lower revenues.\n\nThe capitalisation ratio for development costs stood at 35.3 percent after nine months – evidence of our ongoing commitment to investing in innovation.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses for the third quarter were on par with the previous year, as planned.\n\nOther Cost Changes include the high three-digit million-euro warranty expenses related to IBS and some smaller compensating items.\n\nOverall, the negative net effect in this position amounts to 500 million euros, compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q3\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled negative 2.5 billion euros in the third quarter.\n\nEBT contributed around 400 million euros to Automotive Free cashflow.\n\nThe change in working capital of 1.9 billion euros reflects the increase in inventory levels.\n\nThe net effect of capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cashflow by 1.2 billion euros.\n\nCapital expenditure for July to September totalled 2.2 billion euros.\n\nThis represents a capex ratio of 6.7 percent for the third quarter and 5.3 percent for the nine-month period.\n\nA significant portion of our capital expenditure will accrue in the fourth quarter, as in previous years. As a result, we still expect the capex ratio for the full year to be over six percent.\n\nAt the end of the first nine months, free cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled negative 200 million euros.\n\nIn line with our guidance, we expect a free cashflow of over four billion euros for the full year, despite the planned peak investments in R&D and capex.\n\nOn the one hand, we anticipate a significant sequential increase in EBT in the final quarter of the year.\n\nOn the other hand, we also expect a strong positive contribution from the reduction in working capital.\n\nWe are making good progress in replacing the affected IBS components worldwide.\n\nIn addition, we have taken measures to adjust our production.\n\nGiven these measures and the projected sales volume increase in Q4, we expect inventory to be on previous year’s levels by the end of 2024.\n\nNet Financial Assets in the automotive business totalled close to 40 billion euros as of September.\n\nThe NFA position was impacted by the development of Free Cashflow in the third quarter. The strong Free Cashflow we are targeting in the fourth quarter will increase our NFA accordingly.\n\nGiven our strong balance sheet, the BMW Group remains committed to its shareholder return strategy, which includes both dividend payments and share buybacks.\n\nOn October 25th, we successfully completed tranche three of our ongoing share buyback program.\n\nWe will continue with this program following the completion of a separate buyback of common shares designated for our employee share program.\n\nWe anticipate that the current program of 2 billion euros will be finalized by April next year – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nAdditionally, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item at the upcoming AGM, seeking a new authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nSLIDE 7: Financial Services Segment YTD September\n\nLet’s move on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nThe positive trend in new business continued in the third quarter – for both new and used vehicles.\n\nIn the first nine months, more than 1.25 million new leasing and financing contracts were concluded. This represents a significant increase of 12.5 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe volume of new business, including all new financing and leasing contracts, also saw significant growth of 13.6 percent to 46.5 billion euros.\n\nThe total value of all contracts managed reached almost 144 billion euros at the end of September.\n\nSegment earnings for the first nine months were 12.4 percent lower year-on-year, at 2.15 billion euros.\n\nThis decrease resulted mainly from lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles as well as measurement effects related to the evaluation of interest rate derivatives.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the credit loss ratio stood at 0.26 percent across the entire credit portfolio.\n\nSLIDE 8: Motorcycles Segment in Q3\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, the ongoing competitive situation across core markets affected the volume development.\n\nDeliveries experienced a slight year-on-year decrease of 3.2 percent in the third quarter. Through September, they were on previous year’s level.\n\nThe segment's third-quarter EBIT totalled 27 million euros.\n\nThe EBIT margin came in at 3.8 percent for the third quarter and 9.5 percent for the nine-month period.\n\nSLIDE 9: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nin the fourth quarter, we expect the usual seasonality of fixed costs and ongoing muted demand in China.\n\nBut we will also see volumes well above Q3 and an improved product mix, as the completion of technical measures progresses.\n\nTherefore, we confirm the adjusted full-year guidance we communicated in September for the Group and for all segments.\n\nGroup earnings before tax will decrease significantly.\n\nIn the Automotive segment, we are planning for a slight decrease in deliveries compared to last year.\n\nThe share of all-electric vehicles will increase significantly.\n\nWe expect to see the EBIT margin in a corridor between 6 and 7 percent.\n\nThe Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) should come in between 11 and 13 percent.\n\nDeliveries in the Motorcycles Segment are projected to be on last year’s level.\n\nThe EBIT margin is forecast to be in a range between 6 and 7 percent, with a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 14 and 16 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, Return on Equity (RoE) should be between 15 and 18 percent for the full year.\n\nOur guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate significantly.\n\nSLIDE 10: Ambidextrous approach addresses the short and the long term\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nOur flexible approach allows us to calibrate to changing market dynamics and to constantly fine-tune our cost structures across the company.\n\nAt the same time, we remain committed to invest in strategic projects that will secure enduring future success.\n\nOur performance in the third quarter was impacted by one-time headwinds as well as ongoing challenges in the Chinese market.\n\nHowever, the sales development of our all-electric vehicles in the third quarter clearly demonstrates the continued success in implementing our electrification strategy.\n\nThis year, we are setting a decisive course for the future of our company. To that end both research and development spending and capital expenditure will peak in 2024, as planned. We expect our R&D ratio for the full year to exceed five percent, with a capex ratio of more than six percent.\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE we will take a significant step forward in design, battery technology, software and tech stack.\n\nThis ensures that we will capitalize on the full value generation potential as it rolls out across the whole product portfolio, starting at the end of next year.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE will shape the future of our company and deliver sustained success for the benefit of all stakeholders."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Conference Call Quarterly Statement to 30 September 2024"}]}

This represents a significant increase of 12.5 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe volume of new business, including all new financing and leasing contracts, also saw significant growth of 13.6 percent to 46.5 billion euros.\n\nThe total value of all contracts managed reached almost 144 billion euros at the end of September.\n\nSegment earnings for the first nine months were 12.4 percent lower year-on-year, at 2.15 billion euros.\n\nThis decrease resulted mainly from lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles as well as measurement effects related to the evaluation of interest rate derivatives.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the credit loss ratio stood at 0.26 percent across the entire credit portfolio.\n\nSLIDE 8: Motorcycles Segment in Q3\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, the ongoing competitive situation across core markets affected the volume development.\n\nDeliveries experienced a slight year-on-year decrease of 3.2 percent in the third quarter.

This was mainly due to two factors:\n\nIn the case of IBS, numerous markets have to replace the affected parts before cars can be delivered to customers.\n\nThis led to temporary delivery stops that impacted sales and revenues and drove up inventory levels.\n\nIn the third quarter, we fully recognised the necessary provisions for warranty obligations in the high three-digit million-euro range.\n\nLooking forward, we have already made good progress with the implementation of technical measures worldwide and expect to complete them for most cars held in stock by the end of this year.\n\nSo in Q4 we will see volumes well above Q3 and an improved product mix.\n\nSLIDE 3: BMW Group Performance per Q3 2024\n\nLet’s now take a look into the numbers for the third quarter.\n\nAt Group level, revenues were significantly lower than in the prior-year quarter, at 32.4 billion euros.\n\nGroup EBIT totalled 1.7 billion euros in the third quarter.\n\nThe Financial Result was considerably impacted by negative fair value measurement effects and, consequently, Group EBT amounted to 838 million euros between July and September.\n\nThe Group EBT margin for the third quarter came in at 2.6 percent.\n\nYear to date, Group EBT totalled almost 8.9 billion euros, resulting in an EBT margin of 8.4 percent.\n\nThe Automotive EBIT margin was 2.3 percent for the third quarter and 6.6 percent for the year to the end of September.\n\nExcluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 3.5 percent for the quarter and 7.7 percent for the first nine months.\n\nAfter nine months, the BMW Group’s global sales showed a slight year-on-year decrease of 4.5 percent.\n\nThe Balance Sheet of the BMW Group has increased by 11 billion euros since the beginning of the year.\n\nHalf of this increase is driven by the growth of our Financial Services portfolio and thus represents future profit potential.\n\nThe remaining increase is mainly related to temporary inventory build up.\n\nWhile the third quarter results were impacted by extraordinary factors, it is important to highlight the positive aspects of our operational performance:\n\nSLIDE 4: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nMoving to the Automotive Segment.\n\nIn the third quarter, the BMW Group delivered around 541,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a decrease of 13 percent compared to the same quarter of last year.\n\nHowever, our all-electric vehicles continued to perform well: Over 100,000 units were delivered to customers – 10.1 percent more than in the same quarter of last year.\n\nThe share of our all-electric vehicles was 19.1 percent of total sales.\n\nIn fact, more than a quarter of our total sales came from electrified vehicles – that is, BEVs, plus plug-in hybrids.\n\nSegment revenues amounted to around 28 billion euros – which was lower than in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nIn Q3 revenue per unit continues to be at last year’s level.\n\nEBIT for July to the end of September totalled 634 million euros.\n\nThe EBIT margin came in at 2.3 percent for the quarter and 6.6 percent for the year to the end of September.\n\nThat brings me to the next slide with the details of the changes in the operational result.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q3\n\nThe net balance of currency and raw material positions exceeded the previous year by 200 million euros.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the net balance of currency and raw material positions should provide a tailwind of close to one billion euros.\n\nWe expect this to nearly offset the headwinds from material costs.\n\nBut we are seeing additional requests for supply chain support.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model mix and pricing effects negatively impacted EBIT by 2.1 billion euros in the third quarter, compared to the previous year.\n\nAll three elements trended lower year-on-year.\n\nThe health of our dealers’ operations is strategically important to us. Therefore, in Q3, we have implemented measures jointly with our Chinese dealers to support both profitability and liquidity.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by about 100 million euros, compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development reached approximately 6.6 billion euros in the first nine months.\n\nThe R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was at 6.3 percent at the end of September. It is significantly higher than prior year due in part to higher expenditure, but also compounded by lower revenues.\n\nThe capitalisation ratio for development costs stood at 35.3 percent after nine months – evidence of our ongoing commitment to investing in innovation.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses for the third quarter were on par with the previous year, as planned.\n\nOther Cost Changes include the high three-digit million-euro warranty expenses related to IBS and some smaller compensating items.\n\nOverall, the negative net effect in this position amounts to 500 million euros, compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q3\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled negative 2.5 billion euros in the third quarter.\n\nEBT contributed around 400 million euros to Automotive Free cashflow.\n\nThe change in working capital of 1.9 billion euros reflects the increase in inventory levels.\n\nThe net effect of capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cashflow by 1.2 billion euros.\n\nCapital expenditure for July to September totalled 2.2 billion euros.\n\nThis represents a capex ratio of 6.7 percent for the third quarter and 5.3 percent for the nine-month period.\n\nA significant portion of our capital expenditure will accrue in the fourth quarter, as in previous years. As a result, we still expect the capex ratio for the full year to be over six percent.\n\nAt the end of the first nine months, free cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled negative 200 million euros.\n\nIn line with our guidance, we expect a free cashflow of over four billion euros for the full year, despite the planned peak investments in R&D and capex.\n\nOn the one hand, we anticipate a significant sequential increase in EBT in the final quarter of the year.\n\nOn the other hand, we also expect a strong positive contribution from the reduction in working capital.\n\nWe are making good progress in replacing the affected IBS components worldwide.\n\nIn addition, we have taken measures to adjust our production.\n\nGiven these measures and the projected sales volume increase in Q4, we expect inventory to be on previous year’s levels by the end of 2024.\n\nNet Financial Assets in the automotive business totalled close to 40 billion euros as of September.\n\nThe NFA position was impacted by the development of Free Cashflow in the third quarter. The strong Free Cashflow we are targeting in the fourth quarter will increase our NFA accordingly.\n\nGiven our strong balance sheet, the BMW Group remains committed to its shareholder return strategy, which includes both dividend payments and share buybacks.\n\nOn October 25th, we successfully completed tranche three of our ongoing share buyback program.\n\nWe will continue with this program following the completion of a separate buyback of common shares designated for our employee share program.\n\nWe anticipate that the current program of 2 billion euros will be finalized by April next year – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nAdditionally, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item at the upcoming AGM, seeking a new authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nSLIDE 7: Financial Services Segment YTD September\n\nLet’s move on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nThe positive trend in new business continued in the third quarter – for both new and used vehicles.\n\nIn the first nine months, more than 1.25 million new leasing and financing contracts were concluded.
