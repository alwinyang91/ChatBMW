After twelve successful years, the collaboration between BMW M Motorsport and Jesse Krohn (FIN) is coming to an end. Both parties have agreed not to extend the works driver contract, which expires after the 2025 season. Krohn will face new challenges in the future. His career began in 2014 in the BMW M Motorsport Junior Programme and led him to major victories in the 24-hour classics at Daytona (USA) and the Nürburgring (GER).\n\n\"BMW M Motorsport Junior of the Year\": Jesse Krohn, then aged 24, first attracted attention with this title at the end of the 2014 season. He had prevailed against three competitors in the first year of the then talent promotion programme and started his career as a member of the BMW M Motorsport family from that point on. His first stops were the ADAC GT Masters and the Nürburgring 24 Hours. In 2017/2018, he celebrated his first title win in the GT class of the Asian Le Mans Series.\n\nIn 2016, Krohn drove in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship for the first time, where he celebrated many of his greatest successes in the following years. In 2019, he enjoyed the special experience of competing in the Daytona 24 Hours together with Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) at the wheel of the BMW M8 GTE. A year later, he triumphed in the GTLM class at the US endurance classic and also became IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup champion together with John Edwards (USA) at the end of the season. In 2024, Krohn joined the BMW M Motorsport Hypercar programme and contested the entire IMSA season in the BMW M Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team RLL. He won the \"Battle on the Bricks\" in Indianapolis (USA) together with Philipp Eng (AUT).\n\nThe 2025 season brought Krohn another milestone in his career – his first overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. He also won the 3-hour race of the GT World Challenge Europe on the Grand Prix circuit in the Eifel. After twelve years, Krohn is one of the longest-serving members of the BMW M Motorsport family.\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"I would like to thank Jesse Krohn very much for the past twelve years at BMW M Motorsport. During the time we worked together, I got to know him as a very reliable racing driver who always gave his all for his job. This professional attitude has led him to great successes – be it with the BMW M8 GTE at Daytona, with the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Indianapolis or most recently with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Nürburgring. It is impressive to see how incredibly far he has come from being a junior driver. Jesse Krohn's career at BMW M Motorsport is a prime example of successful promotion of young talent. He and everyone involved can be very proud of this. Jesse will now be taking on new challenges. I wish him all the best for this!\"\n\nJesse Krohn: \"It has been a long, successful time at BMW M Motorsport and I am very grateful for all the opportunities it has given me. BMW M Motorsport has given me the chance to become a professional racing driver and I have had the privilege of being part of most of BMW M Motorsport's top racing programmes after winning the Junior Programme in 2014. I have competed in over 200 races around the world with great teams and team-mates and have had many successes along the way. All good things come to an end, but new and exciting challenges await me. I would like to thank all the teams, team-mates and all the BMW M Motorsport staff I have had the pleasure of working with over the past twelve years. I wish everyone all the best for the future and every success for 2026. I will miss you, but we will meet again on the race track in the future.\""}

A clear strategy, fascinating products and competent leadership are decisive factors for the attractiveness of employers today. Especially in times of global and economic uncertainty, the BMW Group proves to be a reliable partner for its employees. Numerous recent studies confirm this and have once again recognised the BMW Group as one of the most attractive employers in 2025.\n\n14 years at the top: BMW Group once again the most popular employer\n\nIn the Trendence Professionals Barometer 2025, the BMW Group achieved first place for the 14th time in a row. This study is one of the leading surveys on employer attractiveness and is based on a survey of around 18,000 academics in Germany. The BMW Group also once again achieved top positions in other renowned rankings such as Universum's \"Most Attractive Employers in Europe\" and the international Forbes ranking \"World's Best Employers\".\n\nResponsibility, strategy and courage\n\n\"You don't become the best employer by yourself.

Anyone who chooses the BMW Group relies on responsible behaviour, a clear strategy and the courage to try something new. This is exactly what makes us strong. We are looking for people who not only want to manage, but also to shape - people who are ready to make the future of individual mobility electric, digital and circular with us,\" emphasises Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate, Labour Director.\n\nAttractive prospects and benefits\n\nThe BMW Group offers its employees not only premium products, but also exciting fields of work in future topics such as artificial intelligence, electromobility and digitalisation. This is complemented by above-average remuneration, extensive additional benefits, mobility and health offers as well as a wide range of opportunities for personal and professional development.\n\nTop international positions\n\nThe BMW Group is also one of the top employers internationally. In the current ranking of the \"Most Attractive Employers in Europe 2025\" by study provider Universum, in which over 64,000 students from six major European economic nations took part, the BMW Group ranks seventh worldwide among prospective engineers. Among students in the fields of IT and business, the company ranks among the top 18 employers worldwide. In addition, the BMW Group was honoured with fifth place in the global Forbes survey \"World's Best Employers 2025\", which is based on the responses of 300,000 professionals from 50 countries. This makes the BMW Group not only the best automotive player in this international ranking, but also the best-placed German and European company.\n\nOutstanding results in other national studies\n\nThe BMW Group also achieved outstanding results in other national studies:\n\nInternal satisfaction confirms external perception\n\nThe external perception is in line with the results of the internal employee survey: 92 per cent of BMW Group employees are proud to be part of the company and 87 per cent would recommend the BMW Group as an employer.\n\nThese top figures once again confirm the results of the employee surveys of previous years and also emphasise the attractiveness of the BMW Group as an employer.\n\nYoung talents and experienced professionals in future competences such as artificial intelligence, software development and data science will find exciting challenges at the BMW Group and can apply at any time.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport continued its success story in both factory and customer racing in 2025, collecting titles, wins and podium finishes around the globe. In the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), factory rider Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) impressively defended his riders’ title and once again was crowned World Champion aboard the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. In addition, private teams and riders secured no fewer than 12 further titles in the most important international and national championships worldwide. The BMW M 1000 RR also proved to be a class of its own once again in international road racing this year.\n\nA look at WorldSBK, the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) and numerous other championships across Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australia shows that BMW racers were even more successful in 2025 than in the previous year. Overall, they stood on the podium 411 times, achieving 169 wins and 242 additional podium finishes. This means that the factory riders and BMW customer racers once again surpassed the already outstanding figures from the previous year (371 / 142 / 229).\n\n“Behind us lies a season that surpassed our successes from 2024 once again – in factory racing as well as in customer racing,” says Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport. “Toprak’s successful title defense in WorldSBK will remain unforgettable, with no fewer than 21 wins in 36 races. In the FIM Endurance World Championship, we were also on course for the title in a dramatic finale until just minutes before the finish, before a technical issue prevented this potentially historic success for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. But next year we will have another chance to become world champions in endurance racing as well. In customer racing, private riders and teams in a wide range of series around the world consistently achieved top results and numerous titles. BMW riders also celebrated further sensational victories in road racing. All these successes fill us with great pride – they prove that the BMW M 1000 RR is a true winning motorcycle and that our global BMW Motorrad Motorsport family is stronger than ever.”\n\n“The BMW M 1000 RR is one of the best bikes in international racing – and this season once again showed that our customers can rely on it in championships around the globe,” says Uwe Geyer, Head of BMW Motorrad Customer Racing. “We are proud to be able to provide private teams and riders with such a strong package. The race version of the BMW M 1000 RR forms an excellent foundation, and with our global support network we help our customers convert this potential into titles and victories in their championships. Our racing components originate from our factory racing efforts, and all our customers worldwide benefit from the close cooperation between our factory teams, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team and our development department.”\n\nThe 2025 BMW Champions at a glance.\n\nIsle of Man, Macau and more: BMW racers dominate the world’s most important road races.\n\nOnce again in the 2025 season, there was no way past the BMW riders in international road racing. The action began with the North West 200, where the BMW M 1000 RR claimed victories in all five races. Davey Todd (GBR) secured three wins, while Michael Dunlop (GBR) won the other two races. In addition, Todd, Peter Hickman and Ian Hutchinson (both GBR) collected further podium finishes. At the legendary Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, Todd and Dunlop achieved a one-two finish in the Superbike TT, and both riders also stepped onto the podium in the two Superstock races. The Senior TT, in which BMW racers were among the main favorites, was cancelled due to weather conditions. The motorsport world then turns its attention every November to the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix to close out the season. Here, the BMW road racers delivered an outstanding one-two-three result, with Todd taking victory ahead of Hickman and Erno Kostamo (FIN)."}

The biennale opened to the public on 12 December 2025 and will last for a period of four months.\n\nMr. Hardeep Singh Brar, President & CEO, BMW Group India said, “The BMW Group India is proud to continue its partnership with the sixth edition of Kochi-Muziris Biennale, a platform that celebrates creativity, dialogue and new perspectives. Art has the power to inspire progressive thinking, and this partnership reflects our belief in innovation that moves both people and culture forward. The Biennale’s spirit of openness and exploration mirrors, BMWs philosophy of redefining possibility, and we are delighted to be a part of a movement that enriches India’s cultural landscape.”\n\nThe exhibition, the largest contemporary art biennale in South Asia and the first of its kind in India, unfolds across 29 venues in Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, Willingdon Islands and Ernakulam. It sits in conversation with a constellation of exhibitions, performances, and discursive programmes which are set in close dialogue with Kochi’s unique geographical, social and cultural ecology.\n\nEmbracing process as methodology, this edition places ‘friendship economies’ as the very scaffolding of the exhibition. The curatorial vision acknowledges bodies as a landscape of time, a vessel of labour, joy, and loss, and invites the visitors to think through ‘embodied histories’ of those that came before us and continue to live within us in the form of cells, stories and techniques.\n\nBMW Group India Cultural EngagementSince its inception, BMW India has participated in leading cultural engagements across the country. In 2007, two BMW Art Cars created by world renowned artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were presented at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai. BMW Art Cars by Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Sandro Chia and Cesar Manrique have been exclusively showcased at various editions of the India Art Fair. “The Future is Born of Art” is a unique initiative by BMW India and India Art Fair which aims to propel emerging Indian artists and further BMW Group’s commitment to promote art, sustainability, and innovation. In 2012-13, the innovative BMW Guggenheim Lab came to India. Based at Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum and conducted at six different sites in Mumbai, the lab organised six weeks of free programmes with diverse audiences and communities addressing the challenges and conditions of the urban city.\n\nSince 2012, BMW has partnered with the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the contemporary art exhibition, which brings international artists to India and creates a global platform for Indian artists. This vital and dynamic partnership has been instrumental in shaping the Biennale into a global cultural landmark. BMW Group’s continued commitment, even in uncertain times, highlights its profound belief in the power of art and culture to unite and inspire.\n\nAbout the Kochi-Muziris BiennaleKochi-Muziris Biennale is India’s ﬁrst-ever biennial of international contemporary art and its story is unique to India’s current reality—its political, social and artistic landscape. It began as a government initiative, when the Department of Cultural Aﬀairs of the Government of Kerala approached two artists—Riyas Komu and Bose Krishnamachari—to help organize an international platform for art in India. The challenge was proportionate to the ambition of the project. A biennial had never gotten past the conceptual stage in India before. There was no existing infrastructure necessary for an exhibition of this scale—no spaces and no institutional support structures.\n\nWith the support of the government, private patrons, and local businesses the Biennale found spaces and opened them up for art. The Indian art community has been growing rapidly and is emerging onto the world stage, and the international arts community oﬀered their support in sending art and artists to participate in Kochi. Artists became the spokespersons and activists for the biennale.\n\nAbout Nikhil ChopraNikhil Chopra’s artistic practice interweaves live art, drawing, photography, sculpture and installations. His performances, largely improvised, dwell on identity and its construction, autobiography and authorship, the pose and\n\nself-portraiture. Nikhil combines everyday life, memory and collective history; daily acts such as eating, resting, washing and dressing, in tandem with the act and discipline of making large-scale drawings in situ become the process of making an artwork.\n\nNikhil’s works have been included in major exhibitions including Documenta 14, the12th Sharjah Biennale, the 12th Havana Biennale; the 2nd Kochi-Muziris Biennale and the 53rd Venice Biennale amongst others.

BMW Group Plant Munich is ready for the production of the next vehicle generation. The manufacturing equipment has been installed in the new body shop and assembly line, and functional checks have been successfully completed. During this so-called \"Common Function Test,\" every system undergoes dry runs, in which production planners and plant technicians put the machinery through its paces. All production steps are executed without any parts in the system. Cycle by cycle, an invisible vehicle takes shape. Although no actual car is produced, this process provides the certainty that everything operates seamlessly and as planned.\n\nPeter Weber, head of BMW Group Plant Munich, is delighted: “Just in time for the holidays, we have reached an important milestone: All manufacturing technologies and equipment are ready to go, and we are already training our associates for production of the BMW i3. We are taking major strides towards production of first pre-series vehicles, which will then come completely from our plant.”\n\nHowever, plant employees will have to remain patient a little longer until then. BMW i3 assembly, which has so far been carried out at the nearby Research and Innovation Centre, will be relocating to Plant Munich in January. With this move, all technologies at Plant Munich are then in place to continue rigorous testing of the complete production system. Series production of the new BMW i3 will then ramp up in summer 2026.\n\nTypical iFACTORY: digitally planned and tested\n\nPlant Munich is consistently aligned with the guiding principles of the BMW iFACTORY. Both the new body shop and new assembly line were digitally planned and built from the outset. Existing installations in the press shop and paint shop are also integrated into the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory. This made it possible to conduct functional testing of all technologies for the new vehicle generation virtually and well in advance.\n\nExtensive remodelling completed in just 18 months\n\nIn just 18 months, about a third of the plant grounds has undergone extensive remodelling. Old halls were dismantled, and a new assembly, logistics centre and body shop were built – all while still manufacturing up to 1,000 BMW 3 Series and 4 Series vehicles per day. Series production of the new BMW i3 is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2026."}

The new Cell Recycling Competence Center (CRCC) in Salching in Lower Bavaria has now been officially commissioned – marking a major step forward in implementing innovative direct recycling as a joint project between the BMW Group and Encory GmbH. For construction and operation of the new Competence Center, the BMW Group and Encory are relying on regional partners.\n\nInnovative direct recycling enables reuse of battery raw materials\n\nDirect recycling allows residual materials from battery cell production, including complete battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled. The raw materials are not entirely reverted to their original state, but are instead “directly” fed back into the cell production cycle. This direct recycling methodology, developed by experts from the BMW Group, therefore eliminates the conventional, energy-intensive chemical or thermal processing previously required. At the new CRCC, direct recycling will be scaled up and introduced in stages until, once fully operational, the annual volume of battery cell material recycled will be in the mid-double-digit tonne range. Going forward, the recovered raw materials will be directly reused in pilot production of battery cells at the company’s own Cell Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf.\n\nDirect recycling: A process for the future\n\n“Our direct recycling process puts us at the forefront of the industry,” explains Markus Fallböhmer, SVP of Battery Production at BMW AG. “This technology has tremendous potential to further optimise battery cell production.” It is also conceivable that, for the first time, cell manufacturers could be enabled to use direct recycling in series production.\n\nJoint venture runs Competence Center – IP remains with BMW Group\n\nAn existing hall in Salching in Lower Bavaria (Straubing-Bogen district) will be used for the new Competence Center. In addition to the production area and warehouse space of around 2,100 m², the building also offers just under 350 m² of offices and break rooms, as well as photovoltaic systems on the roof. While the Competence Center will be built and operated by Encory GmbH, the intellectual property for the recycling method is fully owned by the BMW Group. As a joint venture between the BMW Group and the Interzero Group, Encory will develop and implement logistics and consulting solutions, including for recovery, recycling and reconditioning of vehicle components. Both partners hold a 50-percent stake in the company. The new Competence Center will employ about 20 people.\n\nStrong partners from the region\n\nWith the exception of one Swiss company, only German firms were contracted for the construction and operation of the Competence Center. Nearly half of these companies are located within a 100-kilometer radius of Salching.\n\nOptimal location for new Competence Center in Bavaria\n\nThe BMW Group consolidates its battery cell expertise at its Competence Centers in Munich, Parsdorf and Salching. The Battery Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in the north of Munich offers state-of-the-art labs and research facilities for developing the battery cells for next-generation high-voltage batteries and producing them in small quantities. The best battery cell from the BCCC will be scaled up for series processes on a pilot line at the Cell Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf. Recycling of surplus material from pilot production in Parsdorf will take place at the new Cell Recycling Competence Center (CRCC) in Salching. The recovered raw materials will then be reused in cell production, ensuring short distances between all Competence Centers and preventing valuable raw materials from being lost. Following on from the BCCC and CMCC, the CRCC thus represents the next step in the BMW Group’s battery cell strategy on the road to the circular economy.\n\nCircular economy at the BMW Group\n\nThe BMW Group views the circular economy as one of the key issues in shaping more resource-efficient mobility. Its approach is aimed at finding the best ways to keep materials in the cycle – ensuring that resources are not lost, but retain their value for long-term use. The BMW Group applies the principles of Re:Think, Re:Duce, Re:Use and Re:Cycle. From vehicle design and production, to recycling and reuse, everything is geared towards ensuring that vehicles can serve as a source of raw vehicles at the end of their use phase. The BMW Group is taking steps to increase the percentage of recycled materials. It returns selected production residues to the material supplier or material processor, enabling their recovery and reintroduction into a new manufacturing process. In this way, recycled and reused materials are already making their way into BMW Group vehicles today. The circular economy requires holistic thinking – from product design, all the way through to vehicle recycling."}

It is well known that there is no such thing as bad weather when riding a motorcycle, only unsuitable clothing. BMW Motorrad took this into account more than four decades ago and was the first motorcycle manufacturer in the world to present its first in-house rider equipment in 1978, in addition to the BMW Motorrad flip-up helmet introduced in 1976. In the decades that followed, BMW Motorrad consistently implemented the maxim of making motorcycling as safe and comfortable as possible and at the same time fashionably attractive and stylish. For the coming season, BMW Motorrad is once again offering numerous innovations and innovative solutions with the 2026 Clothing Collection. Highlight: the new innovative BMW Motorrad System 8 Carbon and System 8 helmets for maximum safety and comfort.The eighth-generation System 8 Carbon flip-up helmet, homologated in accordance with ECE 22.06, offers optimum safety with minimum weight thanks to its helmet shell made of a carbon-aramide-fiberglass mix. The innovative MIPS Integra TX® (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) reduces the rotational movement of the head in the event of an impact and reduces the risk of injury. The System 8 helmet variant is also homologated in accordance with ECE 22.06 and made from a glass fiber/aramid mix. Both helmets offer best impact absorption values and an optimum safety performance. Thanks to two helmet shell sizes, they are also only as big as they actually need to be.

The innovative MIPS Integra TX® (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) reduces the rotational movement of the head in the event of an impact and reduces the risk of injury. Thanks to two helmet shell sizes, the M-Forge® carbon/aramid-fibre mix helmet shell is only as large as is actually necessary. The helmet is available in black and in the Tramontana, Trophy, Calama, Lima and Nasca designs. The GS Rallye helmet (ECE 22.06 homologated) is another ideal companion for on- and off-road adventures. An efficient ventilation system ensures optimum climate comfort. Here too, the helmet shell made of glass fiber-reinforced M-Forge® is available in two sizes and is therefore only as large as necessary. It is available in white, matt gray, black and neon yellow. Both helmet variants offer impact absorption values and a safety performance at the highest level and very balanced aerodynamics on and off-road as well as a Pull Rescue system for removing the cheek pads before removing the helmet (in the event of an accident).

With the Urban Mobility collection, BMW Motorrad offers practical and stylish products that are ideal for everyday motorcycling, but are also absolutely suitable for everyday use off the bike. Be it a stroll through town, shopping or just sitting in a café. Take the Tokyo GORE-TEX jacket in olive, for example. Thanks to the three-layer, windproof, waterproof and breathable GORE-TEX Pro 3-layer material (water column 28,000 mm), the AirVent ventilation system and the removable inner jacket, this comfortable parka in a streetwear look with a casual fit and dropped sleeves can be used all year round. The full-length front zipper offers a clever dual function: two waterproof outer pockets with the zipper open from the top and more legroom with the zipper open from the bottom. The Tokyo GORE-TEX jacket also features a detachable, adjustable hood and two inside pockets. The lightweight and airy Ginza sneaker made from a breathable 3D knitted fabric in black, blue and brown are a perfect match. It combines a sporty look with optimum comfort in dry weather. Thanks to the robust, lightweight and oil- and fuel-resistant sole with BMW Motorrad inlay, TPU-reinforced surfaces in the gearshift and toe area and excellent cushioning properties, the modern, sporty sneaker is ideally suited to the demands of everyday motorcycling. Thanks to a side zipper they are also easy to put on. With the Schwabing LTD Edition jacket (protection class AA),BMW Motorrad has reissued a classic in a limited edition. Each jacket is unique thanks to the embroidered serial number. The black jacket with the metal BMW emblem on the sleeve impresses with the highest material and manufacturing quality. Its premium, water-repellent and slightly elastic nubuck leather is hand-selected. Ventilation options and two outside and three inside pockets maximize comfort and usability. The Grand Racer helmet (homologated in accordance with ECE 22.06) in the new color matt black combines the charm of earlier motorcycle days with modern functionality. It not only goes along perfectly with the Schwabing LTD Edition jacket, but also with the BMW Motorrad Heritage models in general. What sets it apart from other helmets in retro design is above all its pleasant aeroacoustics. High-quality materials and details made of brass and copper complete the classic look. Thanks to four different helmet shell sizes, the Premium Heritage helmet is only as big as absolutely necessary in each size.

Accordingly, the goal is to be fully competitive and fight for the world title.\"\n\nDan Harper (#69 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, FIA WEC): \"The FIA WEC is a new racing series with new circuits for me. I'm extremely excited to be competing in an official FIA World Championship. The highlight will obviously be Le Mans. I am proud to have made it this far to be able to take part in this event. I have gained a lot of experience working with Bronze drivers over the past few years. My first impression of Parker and Anthony is very good. Together with Team WRT we will certainly have a lot of fun and form a strong team. Before that, I'm looking forward to returning to Daytona with Paul Miller Racing. It's a fantastic race and the four of us drivers should be strong enough to have a good chance of winning in our class.\"\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, IMSA Series): \"I can't wait to contest the full IMSA season with Paul Miller Racing in 2026.

BMW M GmbH technical development is entering a new era. Alexander Karajlovic has been appointed the high-performance brand’s new Head of Development. He takes over from Dirk Häcker, who enters retirement after 11 years at BMW M and 37 years with the BMW Group.\n\nFranciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, says: “Dirk Häcker’s departure sees the long-term Head of Development at BMW M GmbH bow out to start his well-earned retirement. His name is inextricably linked with an unprecedented product offensive, superior product quality and yearly sales records at BMW M. We are delighted to have found in Alexander Karajlovic an expert who, in addition to having worked at BMW M before, comes with a proven track record of chassis development know-how enabling him to take the helm and continue this legacy of success.”\n\nAlexander Karajlovic is familiar with BMW M GmbH, having held various other management positions in the past. From November 2017 to the end of 2020 he was in charge of the sub-line of X derivatives and project manager for the BMW XM. As a result, he has been closely associated with the high-performance brand’s electrification. He had a strong influence on BMW M products from 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2023, serving as Vice President for the BMW M Product Line. He then spent several years in BMW Group Development, working in the areas of Requirements, Concepts and Driving Experience Integration. Now Alexander Karajlovic is coming back to BMW M GmbH.\n\nDirk Häcker has been with the BMW Group since 1988, and in leading positions focused on driving dynamics and later vehicle development since 2001. From 2015 he was in charge of Development at BMW M GmbH. What makes Dirk Häcker’s career in the automotive industry unusual is that he complemented his leadership career with that of a long-term driving instructor for the BMW Driving Experience. This again underlines his passion for BMW M as much as his competence in the area of driving dynamics."}
{"title": "MINI relies on Innovative Materials in the Interior", "date": "11.12.2025", "type": "Press Release", "summary": "+++ Award for sustainable material in the MINI family interior +++ Use of secondary materials reduces CO₂e emissions +++ Collaboration as a driver of innovation +++", "tags": ["Corporate", "MINI", "Awards", "Sustainability, Responsibility"], "url": "https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0454374EN/mini-relies-on-innovative-materials-in-the-interior  ", "content": "Munich. MINI remains true to its claim: “Less is more”, focusing on what really matters. With this approach, MINI makes an important contribution to shaping the future in a more conscious and sustainable way. This commitment is particularly reflected in the current MINI generation, for example through the use of innovative and recycled materials in the interior.\n\nKnit partially made from Recyclate – Sustainability You Can Feel\n\nIn line with the \"Secondary First\" principle, MINI uses knit from recycled materials in all models starting with the market launch in 2024. The knitted material consists of 92% polyester recyclate and is used for dashboard upholstery, door trim, and center console lid. This significantly reduces CO2e emissions and water consumption in production compared to primary materials.\n\nDesign, Function, and Sustainability\n\nThe specially developed knitted look gives the interior of the MINI family a distinctive look and opens up new possibilities for individual colour and pattern worlds. It enables a two-colour design with an impressive depth effect. This effect occurs when the colour of the lower textile layer subtly shines through the upper layer. This structure, inspired by sneaker design and carefully further developed, gives the surfaces visual complexity and ensures a high-quality, unique look in the interior. The components are also abrasion-resistant, structurally reinforced, and completely leather-free.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 also relies on this innovative technology: In the \"Contemporary\" trim of the first model of the Neue Klasse, the knit of the instrument panel is made of 75% recycled material – a clear commitment to the principle of \"Design for Circularity\". While the light in the MINI family is projected onto the dashboard, the lighting in the BMW iX3 comes from the rear. For this, the knit pattern was deliberately designed to be more translucent so that the new backlighting comes into its own optimally.\n\nStronger Together: Collaboration is Key\n\nThe textile solution for the MINI interior was made ready for series production in close collaboration with internal and external partners: cross-industry and cross-departmental cooperation proves to be the key to innovations in sustainability. Close cooperation with partners generates new impulses and solutions that further advance sustainable materials and processes and enable the development of future-oriented products.\n\nThis innovative strength was recently honoured: MINI Knit is the overall winner of the SPE Automotive Award 2025 and winner of the Grand Award in the \"Body Interior\" category. The award is one of the most prestigious honors in the plastics industry. The Grand Award is presented for the best submission across all categories.\n\nDr. Cornelia Bovensiepen, Spokesperson Product Sustainability\n\nMedia website: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe economic success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. Sustainability is a key element of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy and covers all products from the supply chain and production to the end of their useful life."}

Built on four continents, the BMW 3 Series has been one of the most important products in the BMW Group’s international production network for 50 years. Since manufacturing began in 1975, the BMW 3 Series has rolled off the assembly line more than 18 million times at 18 plants across 13 countries. Core themes of the BMW iFACTORY – such as efficiency, flexibility, digitalisation and resource-efficient production – thread consistently throughout the production history of the BMW 3 Series.\n\nBMW Group Plant Munich: Origins and role as a technology pioneer\n\nThe main plant in Munich has been the centre of BMW 3 Series production since 1975. From an early stage, the BMW Group committed to flexible manufacturing at the site, enabled by modern technologies, such as overhead conveyor systems and freely programmable welding machines. A fully-automated body shop was introduced in Munich in 1982 for the second generation of the BMW 3 Series. Through the use of industrial robots, it was possible to achieve an automation rate of more than 90 percent for this technology. Supplemented by flexible shift systems and modified work-time models, capacity increased significantly. Continuous modernisation, from powder coating technologies to computer-controlled engine production, ensured that the facility always remained state-of-the-art. Today, the plant deploys numerous digitalisation applications and AI-supported quality systems. In this way, the BMW 3 Series has consistently been a major driving force for the technological development of BMW Group production.\n\nBMW 3 Series as a driver of growth and internationalisation\n\nVolume growth at the plants was also influenced by the BMW 3 Series. In 1980, 3 Series production expanded from the main plant in Munich to Plant Dingolfing, and later to Plant Regensburg in 1986. The BMW 3 Series also provided the momentum for the internationalisation of BMW production. In the 1980s, additional production lines were established at other sites, including Rosslyn, South Africa (from 1984) and Spartanburg in the United States (from 1994). These locations enabled local supply for their respective markets and laid the foundations for the company’s global distribution of value creation – today, a key feature of the BMW Group production network.\n\nThe BMW 3 Series – an enabler for new plants\n\nSince the opening of the Regensburg plant, the BMW 3 Series has served as the enabler for all new BMW plants – with the exception of the facility in Debrecen. The plants in Spartanburg, Leipzig and San Luis Potosí, as well as the BBA joint venture in China, all initially ramped up with the BMW 3 Series. Over the decades, various 3 Series derivatives – ranging from sedans and convertibles to Touring and M versions – have been produced at nearly all BMW Group plants with maximum flexibility. Multiple derivatives and different drive technologies – vehicles with internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids and fully-electric drive trains – all come off the same assembly line.\n\nToday, the seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series is produced in Munich, Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and at the company's own regional plants in Chennai (India), Rayong (Thailand) and Araquari (Brazil), as well as at partner plants in further countries.\n\nPreparations for the eighth generation of the successful model series are proceeding in parallel: A fully-electric version of the BMW 3 Series will ramp up at Plant Munich from the second half of 2026 as the next vehicle of the NEUE KLASSE, with subsequent production in China and Mexico. A return of the BMW 3 Series to Plant Dingolfing is also planned.\n\nSeven generations of the BMW 3 Series across the production network (full plants)\n\n1st generation 3 Series\n\n2nd generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Convertible, Touring, M3 (Coupé and Convertible)\n\nMunich, Dingolfing, Regensburg, Rosslyn (South Africa)\n\n3rd generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Coupé, Convertible, Touring, Compact, M3 (Sedan, Coupé, Convertible)\n\nMunich, Dingolfing, Regensburg, Spartanburg (USA), Rosslyn (South Africa)\n\n4th generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Coupé, Convertible, Touring, Compact, M3 (Coupé, Convertible)\n\nMunich, Dingolfing, Regensburg, Rosslyn (South Africa)\n\n5th generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Coupé, Convertible, Touring, M3 (Sedan, Coupé, Convertible)\n\nMunich, Regensburg, Rosslyn (South Africa), Dadong (China), Leipzig\n\n6th generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Touring, Gran Turismo, M3 (Sedan)\n\nThe Sedan, Touring and Gran Turismo continued to be marketed as the BMW 3 Series, while the Convertible, Coupé and new Gran Coupé formed a separate family for the first time: the BMW 4 Series range.\n\nMunich, Dingolfing, Regensburg, Rosslyn (South Africa), Tiexi (China)\n\n7th generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Touring, M3 (Sedan, Touring), i3 (fully-electric, China only)\n\nMunich, Tiexi (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico)\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nSandra Schillmöller, Head of Communications Production Network BMW Group\n\nCell phone: +49-151-601-12225\n\nMartina Hatzel, Communications Production Network BMW Group\n\nCell phone: +49-151-601-11966\n\nMedia website: \n\nWith its four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services.

BMW M Motorsport looks back on an intense but also highly successful 2025 season. While the BMW M Hybrid V8 experienced highs and lows, the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 with their EVO versions provided plenty of reasons to celebrate. In our season review, we reflect on the most important victories and titles and share other interesting figures from the 2025 racing year. A list of title wins follows at the end of the press release.\n\nLMDh: Strong season start, but also some disappointments. The year of the BMW M Hybrid V8 began with an impressive streak of four consecutive pole positions by Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. At the end of the third season of the Hypercar in North America, the results included four poles, a 1-2 finish at Road America (USA), and two third-places at Long Beach and Laguna Seca (both USA). In the drivers' standings, Vanthoor and Philipp Eng (AUT) finished fourth. The FIA WEC season also started strongly with a front-row start in Qatar and second place in the race at Imola (ITA). However, the second half of the season was disappointing for BMW M Team WRT.\n\nFacts and figures: The BMW M Hybrid V8 completed over 70,000 racing kilometres in the 2025 season, approximately 39,000 in the FIA WEC and around 31,000 in the IMSA Series. During 36 test days, nearly 33,000 test kilometres were covered – around 23,000 in the FIA WEC and approximately 10,000 in the IMSA Series.\n\nGT3: Triumphant season with a highlight at the Nürburgring. The 2025 season with the BMW M4 GT3 was almost a continuous triumph. It began in February with a 1-2 finish at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), the last race of the old model. The EVO version seamlessly continued the success story. The highlight was ROWE Racing's victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), marking BMW M Motorsport's 21st overall win in the \"Green Hell\". Other major individual successes with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO included Team WRT's wins at the Suzuka 1000KM (JPN) and the Indianapolis 8 Hour (USA), as well as Paul Miller Racing's triumphs in the GTD-PRO class at the 6 Hours of the Glen and Petit Le Mans (both USA). Key title wins in 2025 included the drivers' and teams' titles in the GT World Challenge Europe with Team WRT, as well as the drivers' and manufacturers' titles in the Intercontinental GT Challenge, where BMW M Motorsport achieved four wins in five season races. Additionally, the GTD-PRO drivers', teams', and manufacturers' titles in the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup were secured. Driver of the season was Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). In his debut year as a BMW M works driver, he won the 24h Nürburgring and the drivers' titles in the GT World Challenge Europe (Overall and Sprint standings) and the Intercontinental GT Challenge.\n\nFacts and figures: 56 BMW M4 GT3s were in action worldwide during the 2025 season, most of them EVO models. More than 80 victories and 100 additional podium finishes were achieved, and over 400,000 racing kilometres were completed.\n\nGT4: Over 100 victories – biggest triumphs at the Nürburgring. The smaller sibling of the BMW M4 GT3 also achieved impressive successes in the 2025 season. The biggest triumphs came at the Nürburgring. At the 24-hour race, Team AV Racing by BLACK FALCON won the SP10 class with the EVO version of the car. FK Performance Motorsport triumphed in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) in nine out of ten races in the SP8T category, securing the overall NLS victory for drivers Nick Wüstenhagen (GER) and Ranko Mijatovic (SUI). While titles were not achieved in the major European GT4 racing series – the GT European Series and ADAC GT4 Germany – the BMW M4 GT4 EVO dominated in GT4 America across all classes. Thanks to consistently strong results from GT4 teams, BMW M Motorsport secured the SRO manufacturers' title in the GT4 class.\n\nFacts and figures: 88 BMW M4 GT4s were in racing action worldwide in 2025. They achieved over 100 victories and around 150 additional podium finishes. BMW M Motorsport teams covered approximately 330,000 racing kilometres.\n\nEsports World Cup: Successfully defended title. BMW M Motorsport is also highly active in virtual racing, and its three automotive gaming teams continued their success streak in 2025. The highlight was the Esports World Cup (EWC), a four-day competition on the \"Rennsport\" platform. BMW M Team Redline triumphed for the second consecutive time with drivers Luke Bennett (GBR), Sebastian Job (GBR), Jeffrey Rietveld (NED), and Kevin Siggy (SLO).\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Overall, we at BMW M Motorsport look back on a very successful 2025 season. Many thanks to everyone whose hard work contributed to this record. With our BMW M Hybrid V8, the conclusion is mixed. In the first half of the season, we were very satisfied with the car's pace in both the IMSA Series and the FIA WEC. Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve the corresponding race results. While we celebrated the 1-2 finish at Road America in the second half of the season, we generally had higher expectations. We will analyse in detail over the winter what caused this, so we can return much stronger in 2026 with the updated version of our car. With the BMW M4 GT3, we had an almost dream season. The title wins in some of the most important GT3 racing series and the individual victories at the Nürburgring and Bathurst were major highlights. In the DTM, we fought for the title until the last race and stood on the podium multiple times in the FIA WEC. I am also very pleased with the BMW M4 GT4's strong performance. This car symbolises our close connection to customer racing, whose heart lies in the GT4 category. In 2026, the BMW M2 Racing will be added as a new entry-level car, completing our portfolio of customer racing cars. I can't wait for the action to resume in January after a well-deserved Christmas break.\""}

Nicéphore Niépce, a visionary inventor from the early 19th century, is widely recognised as having produced the first permanent photograph in 1826, thereby sparking a visual revolution that continues to shape the way we see the world today. the world today. Less well known but equally influential, Nicéphore, along with his brother Claude, was also a pioneer of the internal combustion engine, an invention that profoundly transformed mobility and our daily lives. These two major advances, photography and the internal combustion engine, have brought about fundamental technological and cultural changes. It is in this spirit that BMW, at the crossroads of mobility and creativity, is passionately committed to photographic patronage, notably at the Niépce Museum in Chalon-sur-Saône, where the BMW residency was born in 2010, before launching the BMW ART MAKERS programme in 2021. Evolution and progress come through knowledge: these inventions provide rich material for artists and curators to think about and create, inviting them to imagine new forms of expression and reflection.\n\nCall for applicationsTo celebrate the bicentenary of photography in 2026, the BMW ART MAKERS programme invites applicants to honour this heritage while imagining forward-looking projects. Echoing Niépce’s pioneering spirit, this exceptional edition encourages the exploration of the links between image, innovation and transformation, in a context where creativity and responsibility come together.\n\nSince 1826, photography has stood at the heart of cultural and technological change—an ambition now shared by BMW through its commitment to more intelligent, more human-centered and more sustainable mobility. Artist–curator duos are therefore invited to propose a project that reimagines our relationship with the image, movement and progress.\n\nThe call for applications is open until 31 December 2025 at 11:59 p.m. The winning duo will be announced in January 2026.\n\nBMW ART MAKERS: financial, material and human support that includes\n\nPractical informationIn particular, the project should:\n\nApplications are open until 31 December 2025 on the dedicated BMW ART MAKERS application platform. More information is available on the official Instagram account bmwgroupculture_fr.\n\nThe nominated duos will be contacted in early January to present their project to the jury, which will announce the winning duo in January 2026.\n\nOver 50 years of cultural patronageFor more than 50 years, BMW has been committed to culture, convinced that artists are pioneers capable of anticipating and revealing the major challenges of their time. Supporting creativity means supporting those who are shaping the future.\n\nThis commitment is exemplified in its longstanding partnerships—23 years with Paris Photo and 15 years with the Rencontres Photographiques d’Arles. By supporting the international art scene, BMW offers decisive visibility to emerging talents, many of whom have since achieved major recognition, reaffirming the relevance of this engagement. This dialogue between artistic innovation, society and business reflects a shared ambition: to safeguard the future of culture and make it accessible to all, today and for generations to come.\n\nFrom Frank Stella to Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons and the emerging artists of the BMW Residency and the BMW ART MAKERS programme, BMW has spent decades promoting new artistic perspectives and the hybridisation of techniques across contemporary art, music, architecture, design, photography and the visual arts.

For the 63rd time, BMW M Motorsport honoured its most successful customer racing drivers and teams of the past season on Saturday evening in Garching near Munich (GER). At the BMW M Night of Trophies, the Sports Trophy Awards went to the USA and Germany. In the drivers' standings, Justin Rothberg (USA) claimed victory for the second consecutive year. FK Performance Motorsport secured first place in the team standings.\n\nThe annual conclusion of the BMW M Sports Trophy has a long tradition. It is the evening when private teams and drivers take centre stage for BMW M Motorsport, acting as ambassadors for the BMW M brand with their racing efforts around the world. The importance of these customers was underscored by the presence of Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President Customer, Brand, Sales at BMW M GmbH, who is now a regular guest at the BMW M Night of Trophies, and Head of BMW M Motorsport Andreas Roos.\n\nAs part of the BMW M Sports Trophy, private teams and drivers collect points for the final standings based on their results in their respective racing series. In the drivers' standings, Justin Rothberg once again claimed first place, scoring 930 points to edge out the duo of Berkay Besler (TUR) and Gabriele Piana (ITA), who tied with 858 points.

They perfectly embody the DNA of our brand and, with their performances on racetracks around the world, serve as ideal ambassadors. While we celebrate the victories and titles of our works drivers and teams, our emotional connection to customer racing is equally profound. Without it, BMW M Motorsport would not be the same. It is a central pillar of our racing programme and will remain so in the future. I congratulate this year's winners, Justin Rothberg and FK Performance Motorsport, as well as all other award recipients tonight, on their fantastic achievements during the past season.\"\n\nSylvia Neubauer (Vice President Customer, Brand, Sales at BMW M GmbH): \"An evening like this fills me with pride. Pride in the successes of our teams and drivers, but also pride in the incredible group of personalities we have once again brought together under the umbrella of the BMW M Sports Trophy this year. I am also proud of the achievements of our engineers, who have hit the mark with the EVO versions of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4. The successes of both cars in their debut seasons are impressive. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this. And congratulations to tonight's winners, Justin Rothberg and FK Performance Motorsport!\"\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"We look back with pride on an impressive customer racing season. In 2025, we had 56 GT3 and 88 GT4 cars in action worldwide, collectively covering over 700,000 racing kilometres and achieving around 180 victories and 250 additional podium finishes across various classes. Our customer racing drivers and teams celebrated victories and titles in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. This underlines how globally successful our BMW M Sports Trophy family is. The best driver, as in 2024, was Justin Rothberg. His performances in the cockpit of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO have been outstanding. For the second consecutive year, he dominated the U.S. SRO racing series in his class. Personally, I am also very pleased with the second-place finish of our BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler. FK Performance Motorsport rewarded themselves with the triumph in the team standings for their fantastic commitment to the BMW M brand, with numerous cars in both the GT3 and GT4 segments.

We can only do our best again and again, and this year we were lucky enough to come first. We are very proud of that. Overall, we had a great season with a great team performance. In the end, we lacked a bit of luck here and there and didn't quite achieve our championship goals. But we'll be going for it again next season.\""}

Björn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"We are entering our second season with the BMW M Racing Academy, and I am very proud of the programme we launched in 2025. The focus is clearly on the academy concept. Our 'Class of 2026' now has the unique opportunity to spend a year gaining insights into the work of BMW M Motorsport, which can significantly advance their own racing careers. Our three BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann, Max Hesse, and Robby Foley are perfectly suited as mentors with their open-minded approach. The participants can learn an incredible amount from them. I am very much looking forward to the coming year.\" Jens Klingmann (Mentor BMW M Racing Academy): \"All twelve candidates who participated in the selection process can be proud of their achievements. They all have what it takes to build a successful career in motorsport. I am very excited to work with Josh, Ryder, and Thomas in 2026. As the name 'Academy' suggests, we will coach the three in many areas – driving, mental and physical training, writing reports, media work – in all aspects that will help them progress as racing drivers. We mentors are there for them, always accessible and ready to share our knowledge and experience. Our goal is to improve their foundation, enabling them to take the next steps in their careers.\" Max Hesse (Mentor BMW M Racing Academy): \"The selection days were very exciting. We had twelve very strong candidates in Munich, which says a lot about the high level of our GT4 programme. As a member of the BMW Junior Team, I can relate very well to the 'Class of 2026' and am closest to them in age. Alongside Jens, with his vast experience not only as a driver but also as a developer of racing cars, and Robby, with his customer racing and Esports background – I think we mentors complement each other perfectly.\" Robby Foley (Mentor BMW M Racing Academy): \"We presented our candidates with many different challenges during the selection process. All twelve were very mature for their age and impressed us. Even though only three made it into the 'Class of 2026,' I believe all of them have the potential for a great career in motorsport. I saw parts of myself in them. I also come from customer racing, so it is an honour for me to support them as a mentor with my experiences.\" Josh Green: \"Being part of the BMW M Racing Academy is a big step in the right direction for my career as a racing driver. Everyone entering sports car racing dreams of being associated with a manufacturer – and especially one with as much tradition and history as BMW M Motorsport. From the 'Class of 2026,' I hope to improve in terms of car dynamics and development, areas that interest me greatly. Additionally, I hope to make and deepen many connections.\" Ryder Quinn: \"It was very special to experience during the selection days what a major manufacturer like BMW M Motorsport has to offer. Now being part of the 'Class of 2026' is a great honour. I always wanted to represent a manufacturer, and in a way, I am now doing that for customer racing in Australia. I am very excited to absorb as much as possible from what BMW M Motorsport offers me. Above all, the close contact with the mentors will be very valuable for me. This opportunity is fantastic.\" Thomas Rackl: \"Just being one of the selected candidates for the assessment centre was already a great honour for me. Now being one of only three participants worldwide in the 'Class of 2026' is absolutely amazing. Our mentors are great guys, not just in terms of their sporting achievements but also as people. I expect a lot from working with them. I am sure I can learn an incredible amount from them and am really looking forward to it.\""}

The BMW Group has defined a new 2035 milestone for cutting CO2e emissions on the road to net zero. The company aims to reduce its CO2e emissions by at least 60 million metric tons compared to 2019 levels, an additional reduction of approximately 20 million tons of CO2e beyond the existing 2030 target.\n\nIn doing so, the BMW Group is pursuing a comprehensive decarbonization strategy along the entire life cycle, with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050 at the latest. This represents a firm commitment to the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. To date, the target has been to cut at least 40 million metric tons of CO2e across the entire life cycle (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. The new 2035 milestone is a logical next step on this road toward advancing decarbonization. At the same time, the climate impact of the BMW Group’s business model will also be drastically reduced. By 2035, each euro generated will see less than half as much CO2e emitted compared to 2019.\n\nThe key measures for achieving these results include the increasing use of renewable energies in production and the supply chain, the increased utilization of secondary raw materials, efficiency improvements in the use phase, as well as product and process innovations. The latter are being implemented across all drive variants as part of the BMW Group’s technology-neutral approach. In addition, an increasing proportion of the vehicle fleet will continue to be electrified.\n\nDecarbonization along the entire life cycle\n\nThe BMW Group has intentionally set itself the additional 2035 milestone to consistently advance its decarbonization strategy. Global customer demand for electric vehicles alone will not be sufficient to achieve the CO2e targets set for 2030 and 2035. The comprehensive approach to reducing CO2e emissions therefore spans the entire vehicle life cycle, irrespective of the drive variant.\n\nIn the supply chain, which is increasingly relevant in terms of CO2e emissions, especially for electric models, the company focuses on expanding the use of secondary raw materials and renewable energies. The specific priorities are highly CO2e-emitting components such as high-voltage batteries, aluminum, and steel. In addition, the company will be implementing product and process innovations, such as in the BMW Group’s sixth generation (Gen6) of battery technology.\n\nThe BMW Group also applies high standards in production: for example, since 2020, all electricity sourced from external suppliers for all plants worldwide has come exclusively from renewable sources. The BMW Group also works continuously on replacing fossil fuels. The new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, is the BMW Group’s first car factory to produce vehicles without any fossil fuels such as oil and gas in standard operation.\n\nTo lower CO2e emissions during the use phase, the BMW Group is implementing additional efficiency measures such as BMW EfficientDynamics, in addition to electrifying its vehicle fleet. As a result, efficiency potential in all vehicle subsystems, such as the drive system, tires, and aerodynamics, is consistently identified and implemented, regardless of the drive technology. The new BMW iX3, for instance, uses up to 20% less energy (WLTP combined) than its predecessor.\n\nReaching the new milestone will also depend on a variety of external factors, such as the transformation of the steel industry in favor of more CO2e-reduced steel, the expansion of the charging infrastructure, progress in the circular economy, and the advancement of battery cell technologies. This is why the BMW Group continues to pursue a number of strategic initiatives, such as the ongoing expansion of in-house expertise in state-of-the-art battery cell centers of excellence and innovative circular economy projects.\n\nSustainability in the iX3\n\nBattery Competence Center\n\nRecycling and Dismantling Centre\n\nBMW Group, Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit\n\nTeamlead Sustainability Communication BMW Group\n\nTelefon: +49-151-601-53189\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide.

The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 will be shared by Magnussen, Marciello, and Vanthoor. In the #20 car, Frijns, Rast, and van der Linde will alternate. In the IMSA Series, there will be a swap in driver pairings. Regular drivers in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 will be Vanthoor and van der Linde. They will be supported in endurance races by Frijns and Rast. In the #25 car, Eng and Wittmann will contest the full season together. They will be joined by Magnussen and Marciello for endurance races.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Consistency was our priority when selecting the Hypercar drivers for the 2026 season. We are very satisfied with the performance of all eight drivers, and there is no reason to make major changes. With every race, our drivers gain more experience with the BMW M Hybrid V8, which is crucial for the continued progress of our programme. In 2026, we will race with an updated car and a new team in the IMSA Series. That’s enough change, so it was important for us to maintain continuity on the driver side. The key is that everyone works well as a team, pulls together, and advances our LMDh project. That’s exactly what’s happening. I’m very much looking forward to continuing this collaboration.”\n\nHypercar line-ups for 2026 at a glance:\n\nFIA WEC, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8: Kevin Magnussen (DEN)Raffaele Marciello (SUI)Dries Vanthoor (BEL)\n\nFIA WEC, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8: Robin Frijns (NED)René Rast (GER)Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)\n\nIMSA Series, #24 BMW M Hybrid V8: Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)Dries Vanthoor (BEL)Robin Frijns (NED), EnduranceRené Rast (GER), 24h Daytona\n\nIMSA Series, #25 BMW M Hybrid V8: Philipp Eng (AUT)Marco Wittmann (GER)Kevin Magnussen (DEN), EnduranceRaffaele Marciello (SUI), 24h Daytona"}

The triad of world-class golf, sheer driving pleasure, and a dash of Bavarian zest in Germany since 1989 has been named the BMW International Open. The tournament has long been an institution on the DP World Tour; no other event has been collaborating with the same title partner without interruption for as long. The 37th edition of the BMW International Open will take place between 1st and 5th July 2026 (Golfclub München Eichenried). Three of Germany’s top players – Stephan Jäger, Matti Schmid and two-time Major winner Martin Kaymer – have already confirmed their participation, with further national and international stars set to follow. Tickets for what is currently the only German stop on the DP World Tour calendar are available from the official ticket shop, and you can take advantage of a ten percent Christmas discount until 24th December 2025: \n\nThe last time that Stephan Jäger teed off at his home club was in 2021. The 36-year-old has been living in the USA with his family for many years and has made a name for himself on the PGA TOUR. Jäger had intended to return to the place where he grew up and learned to play golf to take part in this year’s BMW International Open. However, a joyous occasion in July 2025 prevented him from returning home as Jäger’s second son entered the world. Now there is nothing stopping him from competing next summer. The winner of the 2024 Texas Children's Houston Open said: “I’m really looking forward to finally playing at Eichenried again and enjoying the BMW International Open. Having a tournament like this in your hometown is a rare and lucky coincidence. I can’t wait to enjoy this week with my family as well as old friends and colleagues in front of a German crowd.”\n\nTwo-time Major winner Martin Kaymer is another golfer not wanting to miss out on this experience, and he enjoys a special connection with the BMW International Open. The 40-year-old currently holds two tournament records: he is the only German winner and the youngest champion. Kaymer was 23 years and 177 days old when he won in Munich in 2008, but that is not the only reason that the event is one of his favourite tournaments. He said: “The people that you work alongside make a huge difference. You can tell that everyone at BMW is incredibly passionate about the tournament. Which makes it enjoyable for us as players, and I’m always grateful that we have a fantastic event like this here in Germany. Coming here is a source of great joy.”\n\nIt is this joy that Matti Schmid also associates with the BMW International Open. The Bavarian golfer, who predominantly plays on the PGA TOUR in the USA, has the iconic German tournament marked as a highlight on his calendar every year. As a child, the now 28-year-old watched the pros at Golfclub München Eichenried with great enthusiasm, and now the next generation of golfers are looking up to him: Schmid is currently the best-placed German golfer in the world rankings. At the 2025 BMW International Open he was the best home-grown player, finishing in joint seventh, and he cannot wait for the next edition: “The atmosphere was incredible throughout the week. I hope that everyone will be coming back because it’s great when we have a full house here.”\n\nThe Christmas promotional discount applies to day tickets and tournament tickets, as well as to Fairway Club tickets – excluding tickets that have already been discounted such as those for young people, students or people with disabilities. The ticket price includes a free shuttle bus service between Ismaning station and the golf club from Thursday to Sunday, and free car parking at the tournament site, subject to availability. There is no general admission fee for the Pro-Am tournament (Wednesday 1st July 2026). Children up to and including 14 years of age also enjoy free entry on all days.\n\nNew for the 2026 BMW International Open, an after-work ticket will be available for the Thursday or Friday. It will be valid as of 15:00 and can be purchased for half the cost of a day ticket. For information and prices, see the ticket shop at:"}

The new season of the DP World Tour could not have got off to a more spectacular start. In the first round of the opening tournament, the BMW Australian PGA Championship at Royal Queensland Golf Club (Brisbane), spectators celebrated two aces. Daniel Gale, who pulled off the dream shot on the 11th hole (Par 3), was especially delighted. This is the hole on which the Hole-in-One prize is awarded: the new BMW M5 Touring, which launched in Australia this year. The BMW M5 Touring combines performance with characteristic design, while the plentiful space means it also impresses with its uncompromising suitability for everyday life. As a performance sports car with more than enough space for golf equipment, the BMW M5 Touring is the perfect hole-in-one car.\n\nGale, three-time winner of the Challenger PGA Tour of Australasia, aced the hole on the 154-metre 11th an 8 iron. After the round, the 29-year-old said that it was a predicted shot: “I played in the pro-am and I said, ‘this baby's mine’ – and it actually happened so it’s pretty crazy. In the air it was this perfect baby draw, riding the wind, and landed it perfectly and it trickled in at perfect speed as well.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kazuma Kobori sunk the first ace of the new season on the 17th hole. He might not have been rewarded with a hole-in-one car, but the shot helped the New Zealander enter the BMW PGA Australian Championship weekend in the lead. Gale is currently in tied for 18th place with Major winner and former world number one Adam Scott (AUS), and others.\n\nThis is the second edition for which BMW is title partner of the BMW PGA Australian Championship, the newest member of the family of BMW title tournaments on four continents. The other tournaments include the BMW PGA Championship in London (ENG), the BMW International Open in Munich (both on the DP World Tour), the penultimate playoff tournament on the PGA TOUR, the BMW Championship (USA), as well as the BMW Ladies Championship (LPGA Tour) in Korea. Once again a multitude of top players are competing at the BMW Australian PGA Championship in 2025, including BMW Australia’s golf ambassadors Min Woo Lee and Elvis Smylie. They both have brilliant memories of the tournament: Min Woo Lee won it in 2023, Elvis Smylie was victorious last year.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Touring: Energy consumption, weighted, combined: 2.0 l/100 km [141.2 mpg imp] and 30.7 kWh/ 100 km; CO2 emissions, weighted, combined: 46 g/ km; fuel consumption with discharged battery: 10.9 l/100 km [25.9 mpg imp] in the WLTP cycle; CO2 classes, weighted, combined: B, with discharged battery G."}

Having eight cars on display at the ADI Museum in Milan also means hosting the exhibition with the highest number of BMW Art Cars featured in the 2025 world anniversary tour — a strong sign of our commitment and our desire to convey the brand’s values to enthusiasts, customers, media and partners.”\n\nThe Italian leg of the Art Car World Tour kicked off at the Concorso d'Eleganza 2025, where the Sandro Chia Art Car was exhibited alongside the entire BMW Art Car miniature collection. On 29 and 30 November, the tour continues at the Nanni Nember “House of BMW Brescia”, where three legendary BMW Art Cars will be on display together with the new BMW iX3, the first model of the “Neue Klasse”. Located in the heart of Milan, a global capital of fashion and design, the ADI Design Museum will provide the perfect setting to showcase eight vehicles from the world-renowned collection to close the year:\n\nADI Design Museum The ADI Design Museum in Milan celebrates both Italian and international creativity and innovation.

Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enhanced by a vibrant array of events.\n\nThe BMW Art Car initiative was born in 1975 when French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, in collaboration with BMW’s then Head of Motorsport, Jochen Neerpasch, invited artist Alexander Calder to transform a car into a work of art. The result was a strikingly reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which not only became a visual masterpiece but also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, earning widespread acclaim. Over the years, the collection has grown to include contributions from legendary artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu, each bringing their unique vision and style to the project.\n\nFollowing the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection and the BMW 3 Series this year, car enthusiasts can look forward to another jubilee next year: 2026 will mark the 50th anniversary of Rétromobile, one of the world’s most prestigious automotive shows dedicated to the classic car sector. To celebrate this milestone, BMW is bringing together all BMW Art Cars that have raced at Le Mans for a spectacular reunion in Paris early next year. Find out more about this event here.\n\nShowcasing the collection of 20 iconic BMW Art Cars, the BMW Art Car World Tour serves as a testament to the company’s deep-rooted commitment to global cultural engagement – spanning more than a hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music, film and design.

As the long-term mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival (28 November – 6 December), Smeia, the exclusive importer of BMW in Morocco, together with BMW AG, will offer insights into works from AFMAC lead artists Zeresenay Berhane Mehari, Wanuri Kahiu, Jim Chuchu and The Otolith Group, as well as impressions from the workshops next to Mehretu’s BMW Art Car on the festival grounds during the opening weekend.\n\n10 years of partnership between Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, and Marrakech International Film Festival Established in 2001, the Marrakech International Film Festival aims to support and promote both the art of cinema and the film industry in Morocco. Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, has been the mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival for the past ten years enhancing each guest’s journey with elegance and distinction. Over the last two decades, the festival has evolved into a vibrant platform for creativity and exploration, celebrating the values of diversity, cultural exchange, and mutual enrichment.\n\nFor its 22nd edition the Marrakech International Film Festival celebrates world cinema with a selection of 82 films from 31 countries, presented in several sections: the Official Competition, Gala Screenings, Horizons section, the 11th Continent, Moroccan Panorama, Young Audiences and Families, and films screened in parallel with Tributes given to film personalities. The Official Competition showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature films that compete for the Étoile d’or, awarded by a jury headed this year by South Korean director and multiple award winner Bong Joon-ho. Additionally, the festival will honour Jodie Foster, Guillermo del Toro, Raouya, and Hussein Fahmi – four exceptional figures whose careers showcase the diversity and richness of cinema. Highlights of this year's festival programme include screenings of film productions such as Dead Man’s Wire (opening film/ Gala) by Gus Van Sant and Akinola Davies Jr.'s My Father's Shadow (Official Competition).

The panel “Beyond the Gaze: Authentic African Stories and the Creative Journey” explores the promise and perils of authentic storytelling as part of the creative process building AFMAC. Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will talk about his creative process and explore how to protect voice and vision in a global marketplace that often requires compromise.\n\nAFMAC at Marrakech International Film FestivalAt this year’s festival edition, Julie Mehretu's BMW Art Car #20 will be showcased on the festival grounds, surrounded by an AFMAC Hub. Julie Mehretu unveiled her BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car at the Centre Pompidou in 2024, marking the first time in the collection's history that an artist developed an Art Car that goes far beyond the car as a pure art object. In collaboration with BMW and Mehret Mandefro, Mehretu launched the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), which has been hosting workshops in 2025 and 2026 across African cities such as Dakar, Lagos, and Cape Town. The initiative aims to nurture creativity and foster collaboration with emerging African artists and filmmakers.\n\n“The magic of bringing people together starts with us. AFMAC creates forums for conversations in small, critical masses and surfaces resources to take the next steps. We build on the work of our local cultural partners: They already created a grounded cultural infrastructure, showing that art is not just a nice-to-have but a must-have. The talent and cultural energy emerging from these cities is electric – culture cannot be gated, it will always find a way to be heard,“ says Mehret Mandefro, co-founder of AFMAC.\n\nThe outcomes of the AFMAC workshops will be exhibited alongside the 20th BMW Art Car at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town at the end of 2026. The presentation at the Marrakech International Film Festival offers a unique opportunity to gain first insights into the ongoing project ahead of the final exhibition. The display of Mehretu’s BMW M Hybrid V8 in Marrakech is part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary BMW Art Car Collection this year. To mark this jubilee, the tour features an exhibition programme spanning all five continents and including numerous accompanying events.\n\nThe AFMAC hub on the festival grounds in Marrakech is open to all visitors and located some meters away from the epicentre of the Film Festival Masterclasses, the Meydene theatre at M Avenue Marrakech.

The BMW Z4 is a prime example: truly exhilarating roadster fun. Since the start of the first model generation in 2002, this open-top sports car has been wowing customers with its unique combination of peerless design, a purist driving experience and sporty dynamics. The upcoming BMW Z4 Final Edition provides fans with a time-limited opportunity to order a very special version of this vehicle – one that may well become a collectors’ item. It comes with specific equipment elements that create individual highlights on the outside as well as in the interior. At the same time, the Final Edition represents this iconic two‑seater’s crowning glory. Production of the BMW Z4 will come to an end in March 2026.\n\nCustomers will have a short order window for the BMW Z4 Final Edition, beginning in late January 2026.\n\nDistinctive looks for an unmistakeable personality.\n\nThe distinguishing exterior feature of the BMW Z4 Final Edition is its exclusive Frozen Matt Black paint finish. This colour, which underlines the model’s individual and dynamic flair, is only available for the Final Edition of the BMW Z4. It looks particularly impressive when combined with the M High-gloss Shadowline exterior trim, which is part of all Final Edition models. In addition to Frozen Matt Black, customers can select other colours from the BMW Z4 range, at no extra cost. The M Sport brake in High-gloss Red is also included with the BMW Z4 Final Edition. It impresses with particularly effective deceleration and attractive looks.\n\nRed accents in the interior.\n\nThe distinctive contrasting red seams selected especially for the Final Edition provide a literal common thread which, in this case, ties together the instrument panel, centre console, door trims and M Sport seats in Vernasca\n\nLeather/Alcantara. Another attractive eye-catcher is the M Alcantara steering wheel with contrasting seams to match. It accentuates the sporty character of the BMW Z4 Final Edition to perfection, while specially engraved door sill strips enhance its exclusivity.\n\nAvailable for all models.\n\nOffered for all models regardless of the transmission selected, the Final Edition trim level costs 4,200 euros. It requires the M Sport package already included as standard in the BMW Z4 sDrive30i and BMW Z4 M40i. With the BMW Z4 sDrive20i, the Final Edition is charged at 7,400 euros, as the M Sport package is not part of the standard equipment for this engine variant and is therefore added to the vehicle at the usual cost of 3,200 euros.\n\nThe history of the BMW Z4: Launch of the first generation in 2002.\n\nThe BMW Z4 is part of a long-standing BMW tradition of open-top two‑seater sports cars. This successful lineage includes icons such as the BMW 328 Roadster, the BMW 507 and the BMW Z8.\n\nThe BMW Z4 had its premiere in autumn 2002, as the direct successor to the BMW Z3 launched in 1995. And, like its predecessor, the BMW roadster known internally as the E85 series was produced at the BMW Plant Spartanburg in the US state of South Carolina.\n\nWith its long bonnet and short rear, the design of the BMW Z4 signalled power and sporting prowess. In the cabin, the low seating position just in front of the rear axle made for an unforgettable roadster driving experience. The BMW Z4 set new standards with a torsional stiffness previously unmatched in the convertible and roadster segment. Its supreme agility was also due to its 50/50 weight distribution. The BMW Z4 M Roadster was the first generation’s range-topper. Fitted with the 252 kW/340 hp six-cylinder in-line engine from the BMW M3, it accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.0 seconds.\n\nThe second BMW Z4 generation: Unchanged dynamic appeal, electro-hydraulic retractable hardtop as standard.\n\nIn December 2008 BMW introduced the second generation of the Z4 to the world. The new two-seater known internally as the E89 model series again combined classic proportions with leading-edge engineering.\n\nIt came with a completely new, electro-hydraulically retractable hardtop made up of two roof sections. Featuring an aluminium shell design, the hardtop was included as standard and could be opened or closed at the touch of a button in just 20 seconds. With the hardtop in place, the BMW Z4 offered the refined comfort of a sporty premium coupé. The interior of the new BMW Z4 had gained much over the first-generation model in terms of headroom and elbow room. In addition, this marked the first time the roadster used the BMW iDrive infotainment system.\n\nThe third-generation BMW Z4: Modern interpretation of the classic open-top sports car.\n\nBMW premiered the third – and current – generation of the BMW Z4 in August 2018 at Pebble Beach Golf Links near Monterey, California. The BMW Z4 world premiere revealed a modern interpretation of the classic open-top sports car. A premium roadster boasting an electrically operated fabric softtop, sporty handling and a purist, driver-focused interior design. This was complemented by premium-quality driver assistance, infotainment and connectivity features. Unparalleled in this segment is the three-litre straight-six engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology in the BMW Z4 M40i, which has been offered with a manual transmission since 2024 as the Pure Impulse Edition. The Final Edition will be the pinnacle of the third-generation BMW Z4.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW Z4 sDrive20i (WLTP combined (EnVKV): fuel consumption 7.4–7.3 litres/100 km; CO2 emissions: 166–164 g/km, CO2 class F) BMW Z4 sDrive30i (WLTP combined (EnVKV): fuel consumption 7.4 litres/100 km; CO2 emissions: 167 g/km, CO2 class F) BMW Z4 M40i (WLTP combined (EnVKV): fuel consumption 8.7–8.0 litres/100 km; CO2 emissions: 197–181 g/km, CO2 class G) * Consumption and emissions data:The figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, energy consumption and range are for vehicles as offered on the German market.

Mobility behavior is an important aspect for cities, especially regarding driving and parking vehicles in urban areas. That is why we research how to make the mobility behavior of our customers more city-friendly, tailored to their individual needs. Through strategic collaborations, such as with the city of Rotterdam, both parties gain deep insights into what the city needs, and which solutions work well with drivers. Our research shows that mobility behavior can be effectively influenced by nudging, or in other words, the positive motivation of people.\n\nThrough attractive digital experiences, we aim to enhance the driving experience and encourage our customers to use their vehicles more efficiently. Recently, three pilots based on relatively small but positive incentives have been completed. The insights from these are promising.\n\nThe research project named “My Travels”, conducted throughout the Netherlands in the second half of 2024 with BMW models, provided a report to users about the length of their trips made and offered information on realistic alternatives such as travel by foot, bicycle, or public transport. The results showed that simply gaining insight into one's own travel behavior, including information on the length of trips and alternative travel options, provides incentives to choose an alternative mode of transport instead of the car. This result aligns perfectly with Rotterdam's goal to free up roads for those who truly need to use them.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented a pilot with a gamification approach to reduce the footprint of our products in the use phase. Real world data from a representative BMW and MINI fully electric fleet show that driving in the efficient driving mode generally results in an average energy consumption reduction of about 7%. The “MINI Artwork Challenge” pilot’s aim was to stimulate drivers to switch to this mode. It was conducted in the first quarter of this year in the latest generation fully electric MINI models Countryman and Cooper, exploring whether gamification can encourage more energy-efficient driving behavior. In this pilot, the virtual artwork – an AI generated image — grew larger the more the user drove in the efficient driving mode. The pilot results show this encouraged participants to increase their share of trips in the efficient driving mode by 60% compared to the baseline phase.\n\nIn total, 355 drivers of electric and plug-in hybrid BMW models participated in this project, which brought at least two valuable results. Gamification increased CO₂-improved EV charging by 6% and it suggests that even participants who are already environmentally conscious are still willing to take additional steps to reduce their CO2 impact by charging their vehicles CO2 improved.\n\nThe city of Rotterdam and BMW Group will use the insights gained to develop more sustainable, user-oriented mobility concepts that improve both individual mobility and the urban mobility ecosystem.\n\nThis research project originated from a bachelor thesis supervised by the University of Münster. Erasmus University Rotterdam was involved as the regular research partner of BMW Netherlands in the design and analysis of the feedback survey.\n\nThree hundred participants, drivers of BMW and MINI models across the country, were provided with a test app that offered a clear view of travel habits, at a more detailed level than the “My Trips” feature already known to BMW and MINI customers from the My BMW and MINI app.\n\nThe app contains two elements: Distances and Alternatives. The first offered the driver transparency of their car trips. A pie chart allowed app users to see at a glance how many trips they made weekly of up to 1 kilometer, 1-5 kilometers, and 5 kilometers or more. Alternatives provided insight into which realistic alternatives would have been possible for specific trips: by foot, bicycle, or public transport, including any distance and/or time savings.\n\nThe research question was: do active app users reduce more trips based on the travel report and recommendations for alternative modes of transport than inactive users?\n\nOverall, analysis indicated that active users of the app reduced one car trip weekly compared to participants who did not use the app. This means that simply gaining insight into one's own travel behavior and information on alternative travel options provides incentives to leave the car unused once a week, potentially reducing traffic congestion in the city.\n\nZooming in on weekly trips, the reduction in car usage was even slightly larger: active users made an average of 1.5 fewer trips (of up to five kilometers). In other words, more than one short trip was avoided. No significant decrease in car usage was seen on weekends.\n\nFactors influencing participants' choices related to timing (weekday or weekend), weather conditions, and personal situation (with or without children). This emerged from the comprehensive survey that was part of the research. When asked which types of trips participants were most inclined to swap for alternative transport, the top three were: 1) to a park, restaurant, etc., 2) to the gym, 3) to the supermarket. Picking up and dropping off children remains preferred by car, as indicated by the last place in the ranking.\n\nWhen asked about the three main reasons to leave the car unused, the top three were: 1) travel duration, 2) convenience and availability of alternative modes of transport, 3) weather conditions.\n\n130 participants took part in the pilot. These drivers were rewarded for using the efficient driving mode of their MINIs. The more frequently this mode was used, the further an AI-generated artwork (consisting of stylized plants or animals) evolved. The image was then displayed on the central screen at the start of each trip.\n\nReal world data from a representative BMW and MINI fully electric fleet show that driving in the efficient driving mode generally results in an average energy consumption reduction of about 7%. The “MINI Artwork Challenge” encouraged participants to increase their share of trips in the efficient driving mode to almost 40%, compared to 25% in the baseline phase. This corresponds to a 60% increase in trips in the efficient driving mode.\n\nThe research question was: how can nudges effectively influence the timing of electric vehicle charging to align with periods in which the use of renewable energy sources is higher?\n\nA total of 13.153 charging sessions were analyzed, and timeslots with a cleaner energy mix were identified on 67 out of 87 days. Through gamification, we successfully encouraged participants to shift their charging sessions to time slots with a forecasted higher share of renewables in the Dutch energy mix, achieving a 6% increase in such charging sessions compared to the control group. In contrast, providing forecasts and statistics alone had no significant effect. Plug-in hybrid drivers were less likely to change their charging behavior. Customers expressed three things:\n\nIn 2022, Rotterdam and BMW launched the Smart City Travel pilot. This project focused on motorists who (regularly) drove from outside toward the inner city of Rotterdam. BMW Group, Rotterdam, and the Erasmus University Rotterdam investigated ways to entice motorists to park their cars at a park-and-ride (P+R) on the outskirts of the city and continue the last mile of their journeys using public or shared transport. The question was: what is needed to motivate BMW drivers to make this choice in advance and then actually switch modes when an alternative mode is actively offered in the navigation?\n\nResults showed that information about alternative transport should not only arrive in the car after the trip starts, as people are not prepared for it or, for practical reasons (no coat, too many belongings), cannot or do not want to switch. This led to the idea of focusing more on transparency and providing drivers with insight into their trips and offering alternatives as desired (before or after a trip) in an app.\n\nA safe, healthy, and livable city is high on the agenda of the Rotterdam municipality. This requires a new vision of future mobility, where sustainability, traffic safety, accessibility, and flow play a crucial role. Since 2018, BMW Group and the City of Rotterdam have been working together to realize these shared ambitions and pilot mobility solutions around integrating the car into the ecosystem of a livable city."}

Other highlights include the BMW Panoramic iDrive, which combines four central elements into one powerful unit. With the high-performance Heart of Joy central computer and BMW Dynamic Performance Control, the new BMW iX3 takes driving pleasure to an unprecedented level. That was also the motor journalists’ assessment as they awarded the BMW iX3 the “Golden Steering Wheel” for “Best Innovation”, thus adding to the large BMW trophy collection. Since 2019, at least one of the coveted awards has gone to Munich every year.\n\nTop score and class win for BMW M5 Touring.\n\nThe BMW M5 Touring won the “Golden Steering Wheel” in the “Upper/Luxury Class”. The performance car’s third generation features a new M Hybrid powertrain that combines an exhilarating V8 engine with a BMW eDrive motor integrated into the transmission, for a system output of 535 kW/727 hp. With its versatile luggage capacity of 500 to 1,630 litres, the BMW M5 Touring offers even more everyday usability than a sedan – an advantage that was not lost on the jury. They also rated the performance model ahead of the other finalists in its class in all driving disciplines, as well as in terms of value for money and consumption. Overall, the BMW M5 Touring scored a higher points total than any other vehicle – of any class – in this year’s “Golden Steering Wheel” contest.\n\n“Auto Trophy”: renowned award, historic success.\n\nGerman car magazine “Auto Zeitung” has presented its “Auto Trophy” awards since 1987, making this one of the German automotive industry’s most established awards events. In 2025, there were around 400 models/brands in 18 classes to choose from, reflecting the wide range of vehicles available on the German market. Between 10 September and 21 October 2025, a total of 9,872 readers took part in the poll, registering their votes online or sending in ballot papers by mail. In the end, the magazine’s readers awarded BMW and its vehicles a total of nine “Auto Trophies”. Never before has a manufacturer been so successful in this established readers’ poll. The result even surpasses the brand’s very good achievement in 2024, when BMW garnered eight first places, and confirms that readers hold the current BMW model portfolio in very high esteem.\n\nThese are the classes where BMW models or the BMW brand came out on top:\n\n“Best Small Cars, City Cars & Compacts”: BMW 1 Series (15.7%)*.\n\n“Best Medium Class”: BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé (19.4%)*.\n\n“Best Upper/Luxury Class”: BMW 5 Series (25.4%)*.\n\n“Best SUV between 30,000 and 60,000 euros”: BMW X3 (19.7%)*.\n\n“Best SUV above 60,000 euros”: BMW X5 (14.1%)*.\n\n“Best Electric Sedan”: BMW i5 (20.5%)*.\n\n“Best Electric SUV under 50,000 euros”: BMW iX1 (18.3%)*.\n\n“Best Electric SUV above 50,000 euros”: BMW iX3 (17.9%)*.\n\n“World’s Best Brand”: BMW (22.1%)*.\n\n* Share of votes cast.\n\n** Consumption and emissions data:\n\n1 For plug-in hybrids: weighted, combined (EC AC charge weighted).\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: The BMW iX3 (BMW iX3 50 xDrive: energy consumption, combined: 17.9–15.1 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions, combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); electric range: 679–805 km (WLTP); CO2 class(es): A)** BMW M5 Touring (energy consumption, weighted, combined: 18.1–17.6 kWh/100 km and 5.3–5.0 l/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions, weighted, combined: 119–114 g/km (WLTP); CO2 classes: with discharged battery G, weighted, combined D–C; fuel consumption with discharged battery: 10.9–10.7 l/100 km (WLTP))** ,1"}

The BMW M Motorsport family is gaining reinforcement for the 2026 season. Jordan Pepper (RSA) will become a BMW M works driver and will compete in races next year in the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The 29-year-old is the third South African driver in the line-up, following Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde. Details about his racing programme will be announced at a later date .\n\nPepper boasts numerous successes in GT racing. In 2025, he triumphed at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) and fought for the DTM title until the final race in his first full season. In the GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup, he finished second in the drivers’ standings, just behind the Team WRT duo of Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts (BEL). He achieved the same result in the Endurance Cup in 2024. Further big successes to date include winning the GTD-PRO class at the IMSA finale Petit Le Mans in 2024, victory at the Bathurst 12 Hour in 2020, and becoming the GT World Challenge America champion in 2021. In 2014, he won the overall title in the Volkswagen Scirocco R Cup Germany.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “In the coming season, we will once again undertake a very extensive racing programme with our BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Our goal is always to compete at the highest level in the best GT racing series in the world and fight for victories and titles. To achieve this, we need a driver line-up that is both large and of the highest quality. Jordan Pepper fits our requirements perfectly. Over the years, he has established himself as one of the top GT3 drivers. His performances, especially in the past two seasons, have been impressive. I am very pleased to welcome him to the BMW M Motorsport family and look forward to many shared successes in the future.”\n\nJordan Pepper: “It’s very exciting to begin a new chapter of my career with BMW M Motorsport. In South Africa, BMW is a very prestigious brand that I grew up with and always admired. My path into professional racing in Europe, however, took me through other manufacturers. Now I have the opportunity to drive for BMW M Motorsport, and I’m extremely excited about it. Over the years, I’ve seen how strong they are as competitors, and now I’m looking forward to driving the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time. I know that adapting to a new car is always a challenge, and I’ll need to get used to the car over the winter but I generally like this type of car, as I’ve spent much of my career in similar cars. I can’t wait to work with all the great drivers at BMW M Motorsport – including, of course, Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde. We’ve known each other since we were kids and are good friends. We’ve always dreamed of winning races together. Now we’re with the same manufacturer, and hopefully, we’ll get the chance to make that dream come true someday.”"}

BMW M Motorsport celebrated another success at the FIA GT World Cup in the narrow street canyons of Macau (CHN): Raffaele Marciello (SUI) claimed second place on the podium in the #53 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of ROWE Racing. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) delivered a strong comeback drive in the Team WRT #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, sporting its special Shell livery. His charge brought him up to sixth place in Sunday’s main race. The FIA GT World Cup, held as part of the legendary Macau Grand Prix on the Guia Circuit, traditionally marks the spectacular finale of the GT3 racing season.\n\nAfter Friday’s qualifying session came the 12-lap qualification race on Saturday, followed by the 16-lap main race on Sunday. Marciello secured fifth place in qualifying. Van der Linde was unlucky as after making contact with the track barrier he was unable to set a timed lap and had to start the qualification race from the back of the grid. In Saturday’s sprint race, which determined the starting positions for Sunday, both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs moved forward. Marciello finished fourth, while van der Linde improved to 13th and was then promoted to 12th after a competitor received a penalty.\n\nIn the main race, Marciello seized his chance immediately at the start and sprinted up to second place – a podium position he held until the finish line. Van der Linde gained several positions in the turbulent opening stage and later executed a brilliant overtaking manoeuvre on the tight street circuit to take sixth place. The winner of the main race was Antonio Fuoco (ITA / Ferrari), who had already taken pole position and won the qualification race.\n\nReactions after FIA GT World Cup in Macau:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The second place in Macau this year was a great performance by Raffaele. Gaining positions right at the start was the key to the podium after starting from fourth. Congratulations to Ferrari; I think we were simply missing the pace to keep up with Antonio Fuoco. Given that, we are happy with second place. For Sheldon, it was unfortunate that he couldn’t set a time in Friday’s qualifying. We all know that qualifying is crucial here on this narrow street circuit in Macau. Nevertheless, he gave a great performance and worked his way from the very back to sixth place in the main race over the course of the weekend. Many thanks to ROWE Racing, to Team WRT, and to everyone at BMW M Motorsport. Now we wrap up the season and focus fully on the new year.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (ROWE Racing, #53 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place main race, 4th place qualification race ): “Our qualifying was not the best, for sure. When you start from fifth it’s always difficult to fight your way to the front. But we had a good first sector and in the main race, there was the opportunity to overtake at the start. But in the end we also need to admit that the Ferrari was too quick. I tried my best and second place was the maximum I could do today.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 6th place main race, 12th place qualification race ): “Unfortunately it has not been the weekend we came here for. We obviously wanted to try to win the race, that was my main goal coming into the weekend. But it started off on the wrong foot in qualifying with a mistake that I take responsibility for. We had to start at the back of the field in the qualifying race, had a very good start but then unfortunately got spun around in turn three. So that was another rollercoaster we had to go through. But in the main race, we gained a lot of places at the start and I was able to capitalise on others making mistakes. So, yes, we are happy with the end, even if it didn’t start how we wanted it to. But from P16 to P6: we would have signed that before the race.”"}

The winner of the 2025 BMW M Award in MotoGP™ is Marc Márquez. The record holder in this special competition has once again claimed the coveted prize for the fastest qualifier of the season – for the eighth time. The Spaniard had already made history by winning the BMW M Award seven years in a row between 2013 and 2019. Now Márquez has returned to the top. His prize this year is the new BMW M2 CS (combined fuel consumption: 10.0 l/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G)*. The presentation of the winner’s car took place on Saturday after the final qualifying session of the season at Valencia, Spain, where Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports, and Axel Mittler, Marketing Manager at BMW M GmbH, handed over the keys.\n\nAfter several challenging years, Márquez made an impressive comeback in 2025. He dominated the season and clinched the world championship title early, already in Japan at the 17th of 22 rounds. In the BMW M Award standings, Márquez collected so many points – with eight pole positions and five additional front-row starts – that he could no longer be caught, even though he missed the final four rounds of the season due to injury. Márquez won the 2025 BMW M Award with 351 points, finishing eight points ahead of his brother Álex Márquez in second place. As in the races, MotoGP™ riders receive points for the BMW M Award according to their qualifying positions. The winner at the end of the season is awarded an exclusive high-performance automobile from BMW M. This coveted award has been presented every year since 2003.\n\nCarmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna Sports, said: “Congratulations to Marc Márquez. He has made an impressive comeback this season and once again demonstrated why he is one of the greatest MotoGP riders of all time. From 2013 onwards, we handed him the keys to a new BMW M car seven times in a row at the season finale – and I am delighted that we can do so again this year. His performance and talent have been outstanding, and he truly deserves the BMW M Award this season. At the same time, my thanks go to BMW M GmbH. For 22 years now, the BMW M Award has been an integral part of MotoGP, making it a genuine tradition. It’s a special recognition of what our riders and their teams achieve weekend after weekend in qualifying.”\n\nAxel Mittler added: “What Marc Márquez has shown this season was simply incredible. Congratulations to our record winner: seven consecutive victories were already historic, but his eighth BMW M Award triumph is truly remarkable, especially considering that he built such a big lead in the standings that even his injury couldn’t stop him from winning. We are delighted to add our new BMW M2 CS to Marc’s collection of BMW M Award winners’ cars. This high-performance sports car once again raises the benchmark in its segment, and with its pure performance, dynamics, and agility, it’s the perfect winner’s car for the currently world’s best MotoGP rider. We wish Marc lots of fun with his prize – and a smooth recovery, so that he can thrill us again next season!”\n\nMarc Márquez said: “It took a few years, but I’m really happy to see my name back on the list of BMW M Award winners. This season has been a dream for me, even though I obviously didn’t imagine it ending with a shoulder injury that made me miss the final races. But it’s great to be here in Valencia and to be recognized once again as the fastest qualifier – for the eighth time! I actually found out I’d won while I was out buying fruit – my brother Álex didn’t manage the result he needed in the penultimate qualifying in Portimão to keep the contest open. But I promised him he’ll get to drive the car too! For us, it’s always something special when our performances on the track are recognized in this way. Now it’s time for the winter break, and my goal for 2026 is clear: to win the world championship, and this award, again!”\n\nThe 2025 winner’s car, the BMW M2 CS, is the latest exclusive special model from BMW M GmbH in the premium compact high-performance sports car segment. It impresses with outstanding agility, significantly increased performance, exceptional driving dynamics, and particularly sporty design features. The straight-six engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and high-revving characteristics delivers an impressive 390 kW/530 hp. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels via the standard 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. The BMW M2 CS accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds. Thanks to the extensive use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components in both the exterior and interior, the BMW M2 CS is also the lightest M2 of the current generation.\n\nAs part of its extensive activities as the “Official Car of MotoGP™”, BMW M GmbH presents the BMW M Award at the end of each season to the best qualifier. Before Márquez extended his record in 2025 with his eighth victory, Francesco Bagnaia had won the coveted award for the past three years. The list of winners since the award’s introduction in 2003 also includes Valentino Rossi, Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo, Fabio Quartararo, Sete Gibernau and Nicky Hayden.\n\nFor more information on BMW M GmbH, its partnership with MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports since 1999, and the involvement as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’ see: \n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M2 CS: Combined fuel consumption: 10.0 l/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G."}

The BMW road racers once again proved unbeatable on the spectacular Guia Circuit in Macau. At the 57th edition of the legendary Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, they secured a 1-2-3 finish, resulting in an all-BMW podium. The dominant rider of the race weekend was Davey Todd (GBR) on the #8 BMW M 1000 RR of Zeeco BMW Motorrad; after topping both practice and qualifying, the Briton rode to victory through the narrow urban canyons. His teammate Peter Hickman (GBR) and Erno Kostamo (FIN / Racing for Inclusion by RVS) completed the BMW success by finishing second and third.\n\nIt was the second time Todd lifted the coveted Macau winner’s trophy. He also stood on the top step of the podium last year. However, that time the actual race could not be held due to rain, and the trophies were awarded to the three fastest riders in qualifying: BMW racers Todd, Kostamo, and Hickman. This year, the weather again caused delays in the motorcycle schedule and qualifying had to be moved from Friday to Saturday, but the 12-lap race started as planned. Todd dominated from pole position and crossed the finish line with a ten-second lead.\n\nHickman, who has already won the Macau Grand Prix four times with BMW, made a strong comeback from injury by taking second place. Kostamo, the 2022 winner and last year’s runner-up, was also among the favourites. Starting from second on the grid, he held the position in the opening laps, but a small mistake allowed Hickman to pass. In the end, Kostamo secured an unchallenged third place.\n\nA total of six BMW M 1000 RR machines finished within the top ten. Italian Macau newcomer Maurizio Bottalico (Croweperformance / Bottalico) also drew attention by finishing sixth in his debut on the Guia Circuit. Davo Johnson (AUS / Racing for Inclusion by RVS) came home seventh, and Phillip Crowe (GBR / Croweperformance / Bottalico) finished in tenth place.\n\nReactions after the Macau Grand Prix.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Congratulations to Davey Todd, Peter Hickman, Erno Kostamo and everyone involved on this outstanding end to the season. It has not been an easy year for the 8Ten Racing team – in particular Peter’s severe injury presented the team with major challenges. All the more impressive, then, to see Davey’s and Peter’s squad competing under the Zeeco BMW Motorrad banner, as well as Erno with Racing for Inclusion by RVS, standing together on the podium here in Macau. We are incredibly proud of the riders and teams, wish them a well-deserved celebration in Macau, and look forward to a shared 2026 season. The many top-10 finishes by the BMW riders in Macau underline the exceptional performance of our M 1000 RR, which once again demonstrated its strengths on the demanding Guia Circuit.”\n\nDavey Todd, Zeeco BMW Motorrad: “I was joking with Pete saying that I now have one and a half Macau wins. It’s awesome to do that and to prove everybody wrong after saying that last year’s win wasn’t a proper one. I had a point to prove coming here tis year. I was really excited, we had a great pace, the whole Zeeco BMW Motorrad team has done an amazing job. I’ve been feeling awesome on the BWM M 1000 RR all week. I am just a little bit disappointed about one thing. I thought that the pace was quite slow in the race, I didn’t push too hard when I had a gap, and then I found out that we did 23s, and I am sure that a new lap record with 22s would have been possible so I’m looking forward to being back here next year to see what else we can do. There are so many sponsors and partners who have helped us to even get out here to Macau. We really appreciate all of them and want to say thank you.”\n\nPeter Hickman, Zeeco BMW Motorrad: “It has been a pretty good race. I am very content that I showed that I still have the pace. I was only a couple of tenths off Davey. I am sure he had more in the bag still but to be able to be close in the position I am in at the moment personally makes me really, really happy. It was great to show that I have the pace, I just need to work on myself now over winter to get ready for the 2026 season. A massive thank you to Zeeco BMW Motorrad, all the boys and girls and everyone that helped us and made sure that we got here. It has been absolutely fantastic. A 1-2 for our team – it couldn’t get better!”\n\nErno Kostamo, Racing for Inclusion by RVS: “I was struggling in Free Practice and had many problems with the bike but then in qualifying all went well. In the race I was a little bit nervous. I was pushing hard behind Peter and Davey.

For nature lovers, Iceland, is a true dream destination - and the easiest way to explore it is by car. Even though much has changed in the land of geysers, volcanoes, glaciers and endless mountain ranges, Iceland is always good for an adventure or two - and so is the MINI Countryman SE ALL4.There are just under 2,700 kilometres as the crow flies between Munich and Reykjavik in the south of Iceland - and a few more to the Westfjords. By road, it is around 2,300 kilometres plus a two-day ferry crossing from Hirtshals in Denmark to Sedisfjödur.\n\nThe MINI Countryman SE ALL4 is off-road ready. Apart from the road network in the capital Reykjavik, there is hardly much more tarmac than the Ring Road, which is the easiest way to explore the island. The MINI Countryman SE ALL4 is therefore more rugged than the family SUV is normally known for when it leaves Munich: off-road tyres, luggage rack with spare wheel on the roof, sand plates, spade and jack are all part of the sensible equipment package if you want to experience sights such as waterfalls, geysers and fjords.\n\nTwo electric motors for powerful all-wheel drive. With its electric range of up to 432 kilometres according to the WLTP test cycle, the powerful MINI Countryman sets off on the first leg of its journey, which takes it via Hamburg to Denmark to the port of Hirtshals. The off-road tyres specially suited to the challenges of the island and the extensive roof structure hardly reduce the range of the MINI Countryman SE ALL4. With a maximum charging capacity of 130 kW, less than 30 minutes remain for route preparation during stopovers. On the way along German motorways, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 initially demonstrates its touring qualities: Two electric motors with a total output of 230 kW/313 hp and a torque of 494 Nm provide a powerful drive. The Driving Assistant Professional enables semi-automated driving for relaxed journeys and arrivals. Additional space in the redesigned interior gives the driver and front passenger more room in the shoulder and elbow area.\n\nRough North Sea and long days in Iceland. During the ferry crossing from Hirtshals in Denmark to Sedisfjödur in Iceland, the North Sea is unusually rough with a considerable storm and waves of over eight metres. The weather on arrival in Iceland is worse than expected: light snowfall, low clouds and temperatures below freezing. However, after the start of the stage on the way inland, the already impressive landscapes of lava rock become increasingly worth seeing. The never-ending midsummer sun wins the battle against the night - and so the Countryman reaches the hotel shortly after midnight in bright sunshine after a long first stage on Iceland's mainland.\n\nMINI Countryman: Charisma defies mud and dust. Early the next morning, at around five o'clock, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4, which has long since been heavily soiled, sets off on the challenging final stage of Route 622 - one of the most demanding and dangerous tracks in the Westfjords with a particularly spectacular scree passage by the water, which can only be driven through at low tide.With its ‘Blazing Blue’ paintwork, bronze-coloured elements thanks to the Favoured Trim, all terrain tyres and roof rack, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 causes quite a stir and is a real talking point on the road. Dust and mud on the rough routes cannot diminish its radiance along the journey.\n\nRelaxed and electric on Iceland's rugged coastline. The all-electric MINI Countryman masters green meadows, gloomy scree or narrow paths with cliff overhangs and water crossings with ease. A gentle off-road pace hardly reduces the electric range. Here and there it touches down, scraping the turf, while the views of the sea and the steeply sloping coastline become increasingly spectacular. The MINI Countryman is tenacious, confident and fully electric as it battles its way along the narrow and challenging Route 622, the conditions of which have been made even more difficult by the rainfall of recent weeks.\n\nThe MINI Countryman knows adventure. Coming from the south, nothing works just before the beach section of Route 622: where waves and weather have torn everything away, the notorious track is no longer passable by any vehicle. Even spades, sand trays and jacks can't help. And yet, between Munich and Iceland, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 proves that it rightly bears its name - even fully electrically.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Countryman SE ALL4 (electricity consumption combined: 18.5 - 16.8 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 399 - 432)."}

It charts a course from the early days to the present day, and in so doing paints a comprehensive picture of the BMW brand’s talent for innovation. Good news about the Museum has travelled fast: with over 840,000 visitors in the past year, it is one of Munich’s most popular. The BMW Museum is part of BMW Group Classic – the wing of the company charged with nurturing the history of BMW and everything that involves.\n\nHistory and Architecture.\n\nBMW has always demonstrated a keen awareness of its history. A factory museum was opened at the Munich plant back in 1966, and in the late 1960s the BMW Board of Management decided to build a museum to reflect the company as a whole. Viennese architect Karl Schwanzer won the competition to design the building, and the Museum was duly created according to his plans. His was the inspiration behind the Rotunda, also known informally as the “Bowl” on account of its distinctive appearance. The Museum concept was presented in 1973 under the heading “Streets and urban squares in the renovated exhibition space”. A central ramp within the Rotunda connects a system of apparently floating platforms.\n\nDesign firm Atelier Brückner took the concept to the next stage with the renovation and expansion of the Museum from 2004 to 2008, since when the low-rise section of the building has been part of the overall complex together with the “Bowl”. “Bridges and houses” have been added to the architectural concept, which has expanded the surface area of the Museum to five times its original size. A system of ramps shapes the inner structure of the Museum. It reaches dynamically into the space and appears to be almost weightless. The modern facades of the seven exhibition houses, unusual lines of sight through the interior, asphalt floors and upward-spiralling pathways through the exhibition areas create a lively urban setting.\n\nExhibition and Experiences.\n\nThe permanent exhibition represents the core of the BMW Museum and takes visitors on a themed journey from the past into the future. The route leads guests through seven exhibition houses. The “House of Design” is all about the design process and charts the progression from idea brainstorming to style-defining product; the “House of the Company” explores the history and company culture of BMW; and the “House of the Motorcycle” studies the development of motorcycle design and engineering at BMW. The “House of Technology” displays the technical innovations BMW has employed to meet the evergrowing demands of car and motorcycle design. In the “House of Motorsport”, the history of BMW in race competition commands the spotlight. Here, we showcase the full spectrum of technical possibilities, turned into reality with no effort or endeavour spared.\n\nThe “House of the Series” details the development of individual model ranges, such as the BMW 5 Series. BMW’s lines of communication with the people who use its vehicles is the theme for the “House of the Brand”, which looks at customers’ personal experiences with BMW cars. This house also examines the subject of sustainability at BMW. In addition, the temporary exhibitions in the “Bowl” each have their own theme and are dedicated to particular subject areas at the company. Examples have included the BMW i brand and the overall sphere of electric mobility. Since the BMW Museum re-opened in 2008, it has used special exhibitions like these to present topics in which the BMW brand is deeply engaged.\n\nThe hour-long guided tour through the permanent exhibition gives visitors the chance to immerse themselves in the Museum’s wealth of exhibits and gain some fascinating background insights into the development of the BMW brand. The tours are led by recognised experts, who are more than happy to incorporate specific topics or areas of interest on request. The BMW Museum can also be explored digitally via accompanying content on smartphones or tablets. Here, visitors can find out more about the history of the BMW brand and have a lot of fun in the process. The BMW Museum uses cashless purchase options only – i.e. credit card, contactless methods or mobile wallet – for entry tickets, Museum tours and souvenirs. Entry tickets can be paid for online, using the ticket payment machines or at the cash desk. Guided tours, kids’ birthday parties and school holiday activities can also be booked online – up to six months in advance.\n\nThe BMW Junior Museum is designed specifically for younger guests. The BMW Junior Museum programme invites children and teenagers on a journey of discovery through the world of mobility and is available all year round. Workshops designed for the age group at hand allow young visitors to delve into interesting topics from different angles. The workshops feature fascinating content on topics such as design, architecture, art and sustainability, and fuel the creativity of the kids. The tour through the BMW Museum included as part of the workshops is designed to respond to the youngsters’ interests and meet their needs. Interactive elements allow them to explore mobility from a variety of perspectives and cast an eye over more than 100 years of car and motorcycle history. The workshops are held in German and English. The programme offered by the BMW Museum reflects its vision of an extracurricular place of learning for interdisciplinary educational experiences. The main objective of the BMW Museum’s educational offering is to encourage active engagement with the exhibits on display. The various workshops are geared to preschool, primary-school and secondaryschool children respectively.\n\nThe following workshops are offered at the BMW Junior Museum for groups and school classes:\n\nThese workshops can also be held as birthday celebration events, which include the option of either bringing your own food or booking refreshments from renowned caterers Feinkost Käfer. Several times a year, the BMW Museum also adds a Family Sunday with its own particular motto to the calendar. Here, the Museum lays on a wide range of attractions, such as arts & crafts, face painting and much more besides, and also invites guests to visit the exhibition areas of the BMW Museum. Along the way, the kids explore topics around mobility, design and sustainability. As part of its special school holiday programme, the Museum now also allows places to be booked individually for the Design Workshop held on every Thursday of the holidays. Here, children aged between 7 and 13 can develop their own vehicle designs under the guidance of our experts and with special tools."}

This coming weekend, BMW M Team WRT will make its debut with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) during the official sanctioned test at Daytona (USA). The hypercar from BMW M Motorsport will hit the track at the International Speedway sporting its new design and, for the first time, its new headlights. The track lights combine cutting-edge lighting technology with iconic design. Over the two test days, six BMW M works drivers will take the wheel of the two BMW M Hybrid V8s.\n\nThe aerodynamic updates to the BMW M Hybrid V8 for the 2026 season were already showcased during previous test drives, including the smaller kidney grille and the modified front splitter designed to optimise airflow and cooling. Now, Daytona will see the addition of another significant update: the new headlights. The advanced technology of the track lights ensures improved visibility for drivers during the numerous night races in the IMSA series and the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). These include the 24-hour highlights at Daytona and Le Mans (FRA), as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA), Petit Le Mans in North America, and the FIA WEC events in Qatar and Bahrain. The track lights illuminate the car's surroundings even more brightly, helping drivers better assess race situations, especially in poorly lit sections of the track.\n\nIn addition to technological advancements, the new headlights also offer an iconic design element. The yellow accents of the yellow lights pay homage to the current generation of BMW M Motorsport race cars, as the EVO models of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 share the same design features. Furthermore, they are a nod to the high-performance vehicles of BMW M GmbH. For example, the current CS models of the BMW M3, BMW M4, and BMW M5 feature yellow headlights, as do BMW M models from previous generations. Alongside the headlights, the kidney grille of the BMW M Hybrid V8 will also stand out at night thanks to its unique contour lighting, BMW Iconic Glow.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, BMW M Team WRT will have five test sessions to gain initial experience with the hypercar on the Daytona International Speedway and familiarise themselves with the procedures of the IMSA series. The Belgian team, which already knows the car well from two seasons in the FIA WEC, will be supported at Daytona by BMW M Team RLL. This collaboration aims to ease and accelerate BMW M Team WRT's adaptation to the IMSA series. Behind the wheel of cars number 24 and 25, BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), René Rast (GER), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) will alternate during the two test days.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “I am very excited that we can present and test the update of our BMW M Hybrid V8 at Daytona for the first time in the IMSA environment. The new design and headlights not only look spectacular but are also intended to further optimise performance. We will work hard on this during the test at Daytona, as well as in January during the Roar. The time we have before the 24-hour race at the end of January will be used as effectively as possible to prepare both the cars with their updates and BMW M Team WRT for the first season highlight.”"}

The hopes for a strong conclusion to the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) did not fully materialise for BMW M Motorsport. The season finale, the ‘8 Hours of Bahrain’ (BRN), proved challenging in both the Hypercar and LMGT3 categories. Over the course of eight hours, it was difficult to fight for the top positions. However, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) managed an impressive recovery drive in the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team WRT, moving up from 15th on the grid to finish eighth. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), retired in the final hour due to a defect.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, which had recently seen two consecutive podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars, the #31 car from The Bend Team WRT finished seventh in Bahrain. Behind the wheel were Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS). Valentino Rossi (ITA), Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) concluded their final FIA WEC race of the season in 15th position in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO entered by Team WRT.\n\nAmong the highlights of the 2025 FIA WEC season for BMW M Motorsport was a podium finish in the Hypercar class for the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at Imola (ITA). In the LMGT3 category, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved a total of four podium finishes: the #46 took second place at both Imola and Austin (USA), while the #31 finished third in Doha (QAT) and Fuji (JPN).\n\nThe day after the season finale traditionally features the FIA WEC Rookie Test in Bahrain. For BMW M Team WRT, BMW M works drivers Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts (BEL) – who this season have won titles in the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC) and GT World Challenge Europe, among other successes – will complete their first laps in the BMW M Hybrid V8. Sheldon van der Linde will set the reference laps. For him and Raffaele Marciello, however, the focus quickly shifts to their next challenge: both are travelling directly from Bahrain to Macau (CHN), where they will compete next weekend in the FIA GT World Cup with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs. Van der Linde will drive for Team WRT on the famous Guia street circuit, while Marciello will race with ROWE Racing.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The FIA WEC season finale with the eight-hour race in Bahrain turned out to be quite a turbulent weekend overall, both in the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes. In the end, the results were not what we had hoped for, as our clear goal was to fight for podium positions in both categories. Unfortunately, we simply lacked the pace in the race to do so. Nevertheless, we showed a strong performance towards the end, and the great battle of the #20 car for eighth place was a satisfying way to finish. Sadly, the #15 had to retire due to a loose right-rear wheel. In LMGT3, the #31 also achieved a top ten result with seventh place. Of course, our goal is to stand on the podium, but finishing in the top ten in both categories is still a solid achievement in such a fiercely competitive championship. Many thanks to Team WRT, who did an excellent job throughout the year in both classes. A big thank you as well to everyone at BMW M Motorsport for their hard work, and to all our partners for a great FIA WEC season. We will now carefully analyse everything and come back stronger next year. Congratulations to Ferrari for an incredible season – with their victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the manufacturers’ title in the FIA WEC, and the top three positions in the drivers’ championship. I think it’s fair to say it doesn’t get much better than that. At the same time, I would also like to thank Porsche, who are unfortunately leaving the FIA WEC at the end of this season. Thank you for the fantastic competition we shared – and all the best for the future!”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “Overall, it has been a disappointing weekend. We were hoping for a better result here. When you are starting the season the way we did, you expect something different, but unfortunately, it did not go that way. We have a lot of work ahead of us in the Hypercar class to improve for next year. In LMGT3, we just did what we could. We were unlucky with the last safety car, otherwise we would have fought for P5. But yes, we are not racing to fight for P5. I hope that next year we can fight at the very front.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 8th place): “Unfortunately, it was not the ending we hoped for this year. We would have liked to end the year on a high. There was so much potential at points in the season but we just didn‘t put it together as we had hoped. But at the same time we’ve learned a lot about the team and the car. I feel like we’re stronger than ever going into 2026. So the goal remains the same to try and be world champions next year, but we have a lot of work to do in the off-season. Now I am going to the FIA GT World Cup at Macau, where I want to end the year with a success – and it’s a great opportunity to achieve my goal to win a world title. But I’ve got some very tough competition, firstly with Lello as my fellow BMW driver in the ROWE car and then secondly all the other very competitive cars. So the goal is to try and win the race. I’ve been there on the podium last year so we want to go two steps better.”\n\nRaffele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “The season went differently to last year when we got stronger over the year. This year, we started strong but then it became difficult. After Le Mans, the season has been tough, to be honest. We will try to investigate what happened in the last races and we have some updates on the car, so hopefully this will give us a boost to be able to fight for something more. Next up is Macau, and that’s always a fantastic race. I won it twice, and last year, I nearly won it. So of course we are going there to try to win again. I’m pretty strong there, and so is Sheldon. So hopefully one of us can bring the victory home.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 7th place LMGT3 class): “It was a good race. When you see how difficult this race was for us last year and how big the step was that we made in terms of performance. I think that P5 or P6 would have been possible without the last safety car. So well done for the team, the step they did was pretty impressive.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 15th place LMGT3 class): “Unfortunately, my first WEC season with BMW was not as successful as we had hoped. There were some highlights with the podium finishes in Imola and Austin, but overall, we were always in a difficult position in terms of pace. We constantly had to fight our way from the back, and that was not ideal over the course of the season. However, even though things didn’t go perfectly in the FIA WEC, it was still a great first year with BMW overall.”"}

At the Olympic Winter Games 2022, Team Germany celebrated twelve gold, ten silver, and five bronze medals. The German Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton Federation (BSD) contributed the majority of them - nine golds, six silvers, and one bronze in Beijing (CHN). It was an outstanding team result that the national bobsleigh, skeleton, and luge squads are eager to repeat when the next Olympic Winter Games take place in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy (6–22 February 2026). Achieving that requires hard work in every area and a constant pursuit of optimisation. To this end, the BSD continues to rely on its technology partnership with the BMW Group, established in 2010.\n\nDrawing on BMW’s expertise, technological capabilities, and innovative strength from automotive engineering and motorsport, two projects have been advanced for the 2026 Olympics - both designed to deliver those decisive fractions of a second in the ice track: the BMW Data Coach in luge and customised spike plates for bobsleigh and skeleton shoes.\n\nIndividual spike shoes for greater push-off performance.\n\nIt’s no secret that start times in bobsleigh and skeleton are crucial, as they determine the speed athletes carry into the run - there’s no “gas pedal” after that. To translate their athletic power into acceleration on ice, athletes depend on the right footwear. The force is transmitted solely through spike plates on the forefoot, with more than 250 small, sharp spikes per shoe gripping the ice and converting energy into motion. Any improvement to these plates directly enhances performance in the track.\n\nSurprisingly, standard shoes are typically used in bobsleigh and skeleton - without considering athletes’ individual preferences or anatomical differences. The BMW Group identified optimisation potential and, together with the BSD, began developing custom spike-plate prototypes ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics for skeleton athletes. These plates can be mounted onto any preferred track-and-field shoe using existing spike threads for secure fastening.\n\nManufactured at the BMW Group Additive Manufacturing Campus in Munich, the spike plates are produced using 3D printing - a process BMW has been employing since 1991 across the entire vehicle lifecycle, from concept to production and spare parts. This highly efficient process uses a specialised design software that allows fast, automated, and athlete-specific generation of 3D-print data. Parameters such as geometry, stiffness, and spike shape are customised and adapted to each athlete’s shoe using 3D scans. This algorithmic design process offers enormous time savings and maximum flexibility as plates can be printed, tested, and re-optimised in rapid cycles.\n\nThe 3D-printed spike plates made their World Cup debut last season, with teams such as Adam Ammour’s using them extensively. However, development continued - athlete feedback and summer gait analysis data revealed that some athletes performed better with softer soles and plates. As a result, a second development track was launched, strongly supported by Felix Straub, brakeman for Francesco Friedrich’s team. In this version, the plates are milled from nylon, fitted with steel spikes, and then glued and riveted to the shoe.\n\nA key material challenge is ensuring the steel spikes withstand extreme loads without wearing or breaking. BMW specialists in materials and process engineering developed a solution: the spikes are plasma-nitrided - a hardening process in which nitrogen is ionized in a vacuum at high temperature and diffuses into the steel, improving surface hardness. BMW uses this technique for crankshafts in BMW Motorrad engines and in motorsport applications.\n\nNow, all athletes on the German bobsleigh and skeleton teams can choose between both systems, test them extensively before the Olympics, and select their preferred option. After four years of development, the result is a range of individualised options for every athlete, foot type, shoe model, running style, and push-off position - replacing the one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nData-driven optimisation of material and racing line.\n\nIn luge, the interplay between athlete and sled involves many interdependent factors — optimising as many as possible for the best run time is the key challenge. The BMW Data Coach delivers a major advantage by enabling data-based analysis and optimisation of these factors. The ideal interaction varies between athletes and tracks, much like individualised car setups in motorsport. For the 2026 Games, a new ice track has been built in Cortina, with only a limited number of runs available before competition - making data-driven insights even more valuable.\n\nBased on measurement and simulation methods, the Data Coach gives lugers new ways to fine-tune their sled setup and identify the ideal racing line. This approach is well-established in vehicle development and motorsport. Since 2016, the BMW Group and BSD have been applying and refining these methods in luge.\n\nSpecial sensors installed in the sled record extensive dynamic data, allowing each run to be precisely reconstructed using dedicated analysis software. The software was developed by former Junior World Champion luger Dr. Julian von Schleinitz, now Head of Tech Excellence at the BMW Group, who combines his athletic experience with engineering expertise. Over the years, the growing dataset has made the BMW Data Coach increasingly effective in identifying optimal lines and refining sled setups.\n\nToday, the data volume is so large that - combined with computer simulations - it allows predictive testing of new components and configurations virtually, before any physical prototype is built or a new line is tested on track. This significantly increases efficiency and insight within the complex system of sled and athlete.\n\nFor the Olympic season, the system - used extensively by 13-time World Champion Felix Loch and six-time World Champion Max Langenhan - has been further enhanced. The sensors now deliver more precise readings on wet ice, and the hardware has been miniaturised to fit into a regulation-compliant racing sled. This marks a major step forward, as the measurements now come from a sled identical to competition equipment.\n\nDuring the first international training period in Cortina in late October and early November, valuable data were already collected. These will now be analysed in detail to shape the Olympic race strategy. A second test event at the Olympic track in late November will offer another opportunity for refinement - before the athletes battle for gold in February 2026, where every thousandth of a second counts.\n\nFurther information, images, and video material:\n\nBMW Group 3D-printed spike plates:"}

The Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 will be awarded to Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. The prize honours one of the most influential contemporary artists, who will be represented in Germany for the first time with a solo exhibition. His works, which range from sculpture and installation to conceptual practice, are characterised by sharp humour, bitter seriousness, and a profound reflection on social structures. Since its launch in 2000, this prestigious award has recognised artistic positions that have had a decisive influence on contemporary art and presented them to a broad public in Berlin. BMW has been the exclusive partner of this unique initiative since 2006. The exhibition accompanying the Preis der Nationalgalerie will open at the Neue Nationalgalerie during Berlin Art Week in September 2026.\n\n“Back in 2016, Maurizio Cattelan gave a fully electric BMW i3 a spaghetti-themed wrap as part of our partnership with ‘Rencontres d’Arles’. Creative freedom has defined BMW’s cultural engagement for over 50 years, through hundreds of collaborations across the globe. And it is precisely this freedom that Cattelan continues to explore to its fullest – with wit, intelligence, and often a sharp critical edge. Whether art reflects our existence or opens up new perspectives has been discussed since the Romantic era. In Cattelan’s case, it is always both. Social relevance and creative excellence come together here, just as they do with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, which BMW has supported for two decades. We congratulate Maurizio Cattelan on being awarded the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie and on his upcoming solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate.\n\nBMW and Maurizio Cattelan collaborated at “Rencontres d’Arles” in 2016; together with photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, Cattelan created a special project based around the fully electric BMW i3. The so-called “Spaghetti Car” featured the vehicle completely covered in spaghetti-themed foil – a humorous and conceptual work that playfully addressed issues of art, consumption, and sustainability.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Maurizio Cattelan (born 1960 in Padua) has been one of the defining voices in international art. His iconic works – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin, where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.\n\nThe expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie were also eligible to submit nominations.\n\nEmma Lavigne, Sam Keller, Klaus Biesenbach say: „Nearly two decades ago, as co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.\n\nCattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion, death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.\n\nIn Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being re-examined – between the last generations with direct connections to the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives – Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures, oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and open new vantage points on contemporary social debates. In a time of increasing political polarisation, his art can encourage us to view remembrance not as compulsion or obligation, but as a vital and relevant engagement with the present and the future.\n\nCattelan’s ironic questioning of authority and “truth” carries particular urgency today. At a moment when institutions – museums, politics and the media – are re-evaluating their credibility and social roles, he scrutinizes structures of power both within and beyond the art world, always without a moralizing tone. His works provoke reflection on personal responsibility, historical representation and the limits of institutional critique and authority. In an atmosphere of political and social hardening, Cattelan’s subversive humour acts as a liberating force. He reminds us that provocation and wit are not expressions of cynicism but forms of resistance and constructive reflection. Particularly in the German context, where public discourse often carries a strong moral charge, his art opens up spaces for thought beyond outrage and polarization. Cattelan is not an artist of straightforwardness. His strength lies in embracing ambiguity, exposing contradictions and posing new questions. This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a precondition for critical awareness.\n\nThe Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the 20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”\n\nChristian Kohorst, Chairman of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie, says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of international significance to Berlin.”\n\nMaurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context. In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition.

These strengths give us flexibility and make us resilient, and we are benefiting from them now.\n\nAs a global company with global brands, we are used to dealing with varied conditions and unpredictability on the ground in each market.\n\nWe recognize the current dynamics in the automotive industry: major transitions in innovation, operating with a global supply chain, a shifting geopolitical framework with trade impacts such as tariffs, as well as a rapidly evolving market in China – to name but a few.\n\nWe remain focused on our long-term trajectory, while using our flexibility to adapt to the changing dynamics and are tackling them head on. This is what has always set the BMW Group apart.\n\nOur business remains on track and healthy. As Walter just shared, this is underscored by our Group EBT result over the first nine months – demonstrating the performance of the entire business including our sales development.\n\nDespite the challenging market dynamics in China, our overall global sales posted year-on-year growth of 8.7% in the third quarter; excluding China, it was 12.2%. Through September, sales in Europe were up 8.6% compared to 2024, while sales in the United States grew by 9.5%. These strong results helped compensate for the development in China.\n\nElectrified vehicles and M vehicles both drove global growth. With our technology-open approach and multiple premium brands, customers find products that fit their wide range of needs and tastes.\n\nIn the coming months, we will take this to the next level with the introduction of the NEUE KLASSE. Just two months ago at the IAA Mobility here in Munich, we unveiled the BMW iX3*, the first vehicle of our NEUE KLASSE. The response was tremendous – from visitors and fans from across the globe, media, analysts, and political stakeholders. A few weeks later we celebrated the official opening of our new plant in Debrecen, where production of the iX3 is underway.\n\nWe have started taking customer orders for the car, which have exceeded our expectations. Just looking at Europe, we see orders already extend several months into 2026 already. This confirms an exceptionally positive start for the vehicle.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is BMW at its best. And starting with the iX3, it will set new benchmarks: from its performance data and revolutionary digital interface to its sustainability approach.\n\nThe BMW iX3 offers a range of more than 800 kilometers in the WLTP cycle. Thanks to its ultra-fast charging capability, the peak charging power is up to 400 kilowatts. That means: in just 10 minutes, the iX3 can charge enough to drive more than 370 kilometers.\n\nThe fully immersive digital experience will bring UI / UX to a whole new level. With the BMW Panoramic iDrive, drivers can intuitively keep their eyes on the road while all necessary information is perfectly in view.\n\nWith the BMW iX3, we will also introduce a new generation of driver assistance systems. The BMW Group is the first car manufacturer in Germany to receive approval for assistance systems in accordance with UN Regulation for Driver Control Assistance Systems (DCAS).\n\nThe approval enables the BMW Group to offer the Motorway Assistant with Level 2 “hands-off” function in numerous other models and countries in the future. This also covers an extended range of functions. More innovative assistance functions for urban driving will follow.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, the iX3 is explicitly focused on conserving resources and reducing the model’s environmental footprint – throughout the supply chain, production, use phase and recycling. In line with the principles of design for circularity, the iX3 is made up of one-third secondary raw materials.\n\nMoreover, Plant Debrecen is the first BMW Group car factory that operates and produces vehicles without using fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, under normal operating conditions.\n\nOverall, the iX3 is a perfect example of our strategy of reducing CO₂ wherever we have leverage. This will help us reach our near-term target to reduce our carbon footprint by at least 40 million tonnes CO₂ by 2030. Since 2020, we have been fully committed to the Paris Climate Agreement, with a target of achieving net zero by 2050.\n\nThe next NEUE KLASSE model, which we teased at the IAA, is preparing for launch: the new BMW i3. With the eighth generation of the 3 Series, we will bring the NEUE KLASSE and its technology clusters into the core of the BMW brand. Production of the i3 will get underway at our main plant in Munich in the second half of next year. Other locations in our international production network will follow with production of 3 Series variants.\n\nThroughout 2026, we will show how the NEUE KLASSE technologies will be integrated into further models, such as the 7 Series and the X5. By 2027, we will put 40 new models and model updates with NEUE KLASSE technology and design language on the road worldwide.\n\nThis all-new BMW generation will provide an enormous boost to our already broad and popular portfolio – with technology solutions tailored to customers in their markets.\n\nThis applies especially to China. The NEUE KLASSE products we will launch in China are developed together with our local engineering teams and Chinese partners – in the market, for the market. Our NEUE KLASSE architecture allows to integrate local tech stacks from leading Chinese tech players into our own ecosystem. This gives consumers access to innovations and features they are used to, including solutions from Alibaba Banma, DeepSeek, and Momenta.\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we are again demonstrating our strength in mastering system complexity, integration and efficiency. We know what our customers want and identify trends in individual markets early. The result are products that perfectly integrate the best technologies – both in house and with partners – across regions to offer the best product substance to our customers.\n\nWhat makes the NEUE KLASSE so unique, is that we are rolling out the technology clusters across the entire portfolio – regardless of the drivetrain.\n\nOur technology-neutral approach continues to show its success and allows broad market access as consumer preferences shift. At the same time, we are making progress in decarbonization in the here and now. After nine months into 2025, Group sales of all-electric vehicles are up by 10%, resulting in a BEV share of 18%. PHEVs grew nearly 28% year-on-year, delivering an overall electrified share through September of 26.2% globally.\n\nEurope showed particularly strong growth – with BEVs reaching over a quarter of total sales, while BEV and PHEV sales combined for an impressive 41% share. Europe will also be the primary driver of our BMW iX3 sales in 2026.\n\nThanks to this solid result, we are well on course to reach our CO₂ fleet target for the year, just as we have consistently done for the past several years. For us, it has long been clear that we would meet the targets for 2025 – and, importantly, without penalties, pooling, or averaging.\n\nThis success with our technology-neutral strategy also gives our voice weight in the ongoing discussion regarding the EU’s targets.\n\nWe have reached our climate targets by following market demand and customer needs and by continually optimizing all drivetrain variants.\n\nIt remains critical for Europe to revisit the targets for 2030 and 2035.\n\nSetting an end date to a specific, successful technology will lead to a massive shrinking of the industry as a whole. It will harm European industry and also create dependencies that are unwise in the current geopolitical dynamic.\n\nTo achieve climate goals and create effective CO₂ regulations, we must take a comprehensive view – one that accounts for the full carbon footprint of the vehicle and its value chain, and that also values climate-neutral fuels such as HVO100. Such a holistic framework would reflect various market needs and uneven infrastructure development, while safeguarding Europe’s value chains, jobs, and industrial strengths. And – above all – it delivers genuine climate protection and real reductions in CO₂.\n\nCompanies should be free to deliver the solutions, taking customer demands and needs into account, while adequately investing in new paths and technologies to achieve the EU’s climate goals.\n\nIn this context, the BMW Group is very skeptical about the EU’s planned “Greening the Fleets” regulation, as it does not consider current market realities. Commercial fleets rely on high vehicle availability with high mileages. The currently inadequate charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure will not be guaranteed in all member states by 2030 either. Further fleet mandates and additional regulations that exclude individual technologies are not necessary to achieve the CO₂ targets. Moreover, they hinder technological development and introduce harmful market distortions contrary to customer preferences. Here also, we advocate for a holistic and technology-neutral approach.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWe are tackling the challenges in global markets head on, leveraging our strengths and implementing our long-term strategy. We have made significant investments and have created the right operating framework to deliver. Our flexible, global network, our tech-open strategy, our focus on innovation and our ability to master technological complexity set us apart.\n\nOver the coming months, we will deliver as promised. Starting with the iX3, we will rapidly deploy our ambitious strategy one vehicle at a time around the globe. We will continue to lead with product substance and solutions that meet our customers’ needs.\n\nWe therefore remain optimistic as we close out 2025 and move forward to 2026.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: energy consumption combined: 17,9–15,1 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: A"}

Accordingly, we have adjusted our planning and now anticipate a consistent monthly run rate in China in line with the first half of 2025.\n\nIn addition, we have introduced measures to support the profitability and liquidity of our dealers in China.\n\nThese measures will also have an impact on our Q4 profitability.\n\nThe consolidation of our dealer network in China is progressing to plan.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWith respect to tariffs, the BMW Group has been fully transparent throughout the year concerning the impact on our 2025 financial results.\n\nOur original guidance given in March as well as our updated assessments in the Q1 and Q2 reporting were based on certain assumptions.\n\nAs mentioned in our ad-hoc announcement, these assumptions were not fully realized as expected to date.\n\nWe now anticipate a tariff-related headwind of 1.5 percentage points on the Auto EBIT margin for the full year.\n\nI will share further details on our full-year outlook later on.\n\nBut now, let me walk you through our Q3 figures.\n\nGroup earnings before tax totaled over 2.3 billion euros in the third quarter and exceeded 8 billion euros year-to-date through September.\n\nCompared to the first nine months of 2024, this represents only a slight decrease of 9.1 percent – a notable achievement in light of the current developments in the Automotive industry.\n\nAnd for the full year, we also expect a decrease in the single-digit range only.\n\nThis represents a full-year Group profit before tax of approximately 10 billion euros – despite the significant burden of higher tariffs.\n\nExcluding the impact of tariffs, pre-tax profit even exceeds the 2024 figure.\n\nWithin the BMW Group ecosystem, every segment contributes to our overall success.\n\nThe reported Group EBT margin stood at 7.2 percent in the third quarter and 8.1 percent year-to-date through September.\n\nThe reported Auto EBIT margin fell within our full-year target corridor for both Q3, at 5.2 percent, and year-to-date through September, at 5.9 percent.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs you know, the BMW Group is always transparent in its reporting, and we consistently focus on communicating our published figures.\n\nFor better comparability within the industry, allow me, nevertheless, to provide a few additional details regarding our operational performance in the Automotive segment.\n\nFirst: Auto EBIT includes the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA.\n\nExcluding this depreciation, which amounts to approximately 1.1 percentage points, the quarterly margin would be 6.3 percent, and the nine-month margin would be 7.0 percent.\n\nSecond: Auto EBIT also includes the burden of extra tariffs, which amounts to around 1.75 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.5 percentage points through September.\n\nThis impact should also be added for a fair comparison of our EBIT margin.\n\nQ3 deliveries to customers at Group level increased solidly by 8.7 percent year-on-year.\n\nAfter nine months, the share of all-electric vehicles reached 18 percent of total sales.\n\nAnd with a share of 26.2 percent, more than one in four vehicles sold globally was electrified, meaning either a BEV or a plug-in hybrid.\n\nLet’s now take a look at how the Automotive Segment performed across key metrics.\n\nDeliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers reached 588,140 units in the third quarter.\n\nIn Europe, sales grew by 9.3 percent, and in the US by 24.9 percent.\n\nIn China, retail sales did not meet our expectations, with deliveries at previous year’s level.\n\nAfter nine months, global retail sales approached 1.8 million units, representing a slight increase of 2.4 percent.\n\nThis clearly demonstrates the strength of our global business model, with sales performance in Europe and the US more than compensating the challenges in China.\n\nSales of all-electric vehicles exceeded 100,000 units for the sixth consecutive quarter.\n\nQ3 revenues in the Automotive segment amounted to 28.5 billion euros, reflecting a slight increase of 2.4 percent year-on-year. Adjusted for currency translation effects, the increase was 6.4 percent.\n\nSegment EBIT amounted to approximately 1.5 billion euros in Q3 and 5.1 billion euros from January to September.\n\nThe reported EBIT margin – including the negative impact of BBA PPA and tariffs – came in at 5.2 percent for the quarter and 5.9 percent as of September.\n\nThat brings me to my next slide, taking a detailed look at our operating result of the third quarter year-on-year.\n\nAutomotive EBIT increased by around 900 million euros compared to Q3 2024.\n\nAs anticipated at mid-year, changes in currencies negatively impacted EBIT by 500 million euros, while raw material positions remained neutral.\n\nThe net effect of volume, model mix and pricing resulted in a negative impact of 300 million euros in the third quarter, compared to the previous year.\n\nBoth volume and model mix provided a tailwind, while pricing was a headwind.\n\nThis is particularly evident in China, where we see price pressure across all segments.\n\nFurthermore, since the end of June, Chinese banks have significantly reduced dealer commissions.\n\nWhile this led to a certain increase in transaction prices, as expected, it could not offset the negative impact of the lower commission revenues for dealerships.\n\nConsequently, we implemented dealer support measures in Q3 to strengthen dealer profitability and liquidity.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn line with our planning, we will continue to decrease our operating costs in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThis trend is once again reflected in our figures for the third quarter.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by about 300 million euros compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nGroup R&D expenditure totaled 5.9 billion euros as of September. This remains significantly below last year's level, despite extensive product initiatives and intensive preparations for the first models of the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nThe R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code stood at 5.9 percent after nine months.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased by around 200 million euros compared to the previous year.\n\nThese nominal cost savings of 500 million euros more than offset the negative impact from volume, model mix and pricing.\n\nOther Cost Changes provided a tailwind of around 1.2 billion euros compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThis development results mainly from three areas:\n\nOn the one hand, warranty expenses were significantly lower year-on-year.\n\nIn Q3 2024, we fully recognized the necessary warranty provisions for the Integrated Braking System.\n\nOn the other hand, tariffs had a negative impact of around 1.75 percentage points on the Auto EBIT margin in Q3.\n\nThe majority of the improvement in other cost changes in Q3 results from the positive development of manufacturing costs and material costs.\n\nOverall, we reduced costs by over 1 billion euros in the third quarter and by approximately 2 billion euros year-to-date through September.\n\nIn addition to EBIT, tariffs also affect free cashflow.\n\nWhile refunds are recognized in EBIT, cash will rather be recognized in 2026 than in 2025.\n\nThis negatively affected free cashflow through September, and the timing effect alone will impact free cashflow for the full-year by a high three-digit million euros amount.\n\nFree cash flow in the Automotive Segment totaled 343 million euros in the third quarter.\n\nEarnings before tax amounted to 1.4 billion euros.\n\nThe net change in working capital contributed positively to free cashflow by around 300 million euros.\n\nThe negative net effect of capital expenditure and depreciation impacted the third quarter by 300 million euros.\n\nThe capex ratio was 5.2 percent in the third quarter and 4.4 percent for the first nine months.\n\nFollowing the peak in 2024, capex will decrease for the full year 2025. The capex ratio is projected to remain below 6 percent.\n\nChanges to provisions negatively impacted free cash flow in the third quarter by approximately 400 million euros.\n\nThis was primarily due to the consumption of warranty provisions.\n\nThe change in the position Other, amounting to around 600 million euros, includes income taxes paid.\n\nAfter nine months, free cash flow in the Automotive segment stands at almost 2.7 billion euros.\n\nFor the full year, we now target a free cash flow of over 2.5 billion euros, compared to the original forecast of over 5 billion euros.\n\nThis is driven by two factors:\n\nLower-than-expected earnings for the full year\n\nAnd tariff refunds that we expect to receive in 2026 instead of 2025\n\nWe remain committed to shareholder returns using both dividends and share buyback.\n\nDespite the lower free cashflow outlook, we will maintain our dividend payout ratio of 30 to 40 percent and will continue our share buyback program as announced.\n\nAs a result, the anticipated shareholder returns for the financial year 2025 will exceed free cashflow.\n\nLet’s now turn to our Financial Services segment.\n\nFinancial Services is a key component of our customer journey and an important part of our integrated value chain.\n\nAs a vital element of our financial operating model, the segment contributes consistently to our Group profit.\n\nNew business grew significantly during the third quarter, primarily driven by the changed competitive environment in China.\n\nThis contributed to a slight year-on-year increase of 1.9 percent in new leasing and financing contracts concluded with retail customers over the nine-months-period.\n\nNew business volume increased by 4.2 percent to 48.5 billion euros.\n\nThe penetration rate for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.1 percentage points to 46.4 percent.\n\nSegment earnings amounted to more than 1.8 billion euros, a year-on-year decrease of 14.4 percent.\n\nThe decline is primarily attributable to the lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles as well as a tax payment in the second quarter resulting from a revised operational tax assessment for prior years.\n\nResale income remains positive on a portfolio basis.\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained low at 0.26 percent.\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, deliveries increased solidly by 5.7 percent year-on-year.\n\nEBIT for the second quarter totaled 60 million euros, resulting in an EBIT margin of 7.9 percent.\n\nLet’s now turn to our outlook for the 2025 financial year.\n\nFour weeks ago, we confirmed that the Auto EBIT margin will remain in the guided corridor of 5 to 7 percent – more specifically in the range of 5 to 6 percent.\n\nWe also confirmed that deliveries in the Automotive segment are expected to increase slightly.\n\nAt the same time, the BMW Group adjusted its guidance for the following two key performance indicators:\n\nGroup Profit before Tax, which we now anticipate to decrease slightly compared to 2024\n\nReturn on Capital Employed (RoCE) in the Automotive segment, which is now expected in a corridor between 8 and 10 percent\n\nIn the Motorcycles segment, deliveries are now expected to decrease slightly, whilst the EBIT margin range is confirmed between 5.5 and 7.5 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we confirm a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 13 to 16 percent.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWe have invested early and significantly in the future of our company, in line with our long-term strategy.\n\nOur technology clusters are ready – paving the way for the broad deployment of innovations across our complete product portfolio.\n\nOur Gen6 battery technology will shortly hit the market and support profitability with cost savings of 40 to 50 percent for the battery pack.\n\nAfter reaching their peak levels in 2024, we are reducing both capex and R&D, as planned.\n\nWe are also maintaining our consistent management of operational costs. This is reflected in our figures for the third quarter and through September, and it will continue to be visible going forward.\n\nWith our highly attractive products and the NEUE KLASSE, we have the right levers in place to continuously strengthen our global market position, today and in the future.\n\nWe believe that our 2025 profitability stands out in the current business environment, with a pre-tax profit decline only in the single-digit percentage range year-on-year.\n\nAnd with our strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we will deliver consistent returns for our stakeholders."}

The BMW Group’s performance in the year to date has been characterised by robust global sales development, disciplined cost management and a consistent strategic framework.\n\nThe Automotive Segment EBIT margin remained within the full-year target range for both the first nine months and the third quarter – despite continuing geopolitical challenges and intensifying competition. Customer deliveries rose slightly year-to-to date at the end of September, while free cash flow in the Automotive Segment stood at € 2,688 million after nine months. On Wednesday, based on these results, the Munich premium manufacturer confirmed its adjusted financial full-year targets announced in October.\n\n“In the third quarter, we once again proved that our business model is robust and resilient”, said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “We have all the right factors for continued success: a technology-neutral approach, exciting products, a strong global presence and outstanding innovation capabilities throughout the entire value chain. Thanks to our broad model and drive train portfolio, we were able to increase our global sales – with BMW M and our electrified vehicles as the main growth drivers. At the same time, we remain fully on track to meet Europe's ambitious CO2 targets for 2025 – without relying on flexibility mechanisms or pooling. This demonstrates that our technology-neutral approach is working and delivering strong results.”\n\nGrowth in electrified vehicles and M models\n\nYear-on-year, the BMW Group achieved a slight +2.4% increase in deliveries, reaching a total of 1,795,734 vehicles in the YTD September (2024: 1,754,157vehicles). In the third quarter, the premium manufacturer delivered 588,140 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers (2024: 540,881 vehicles/+8.7%).\n\nThe success of the BMW Group's technology-neutral strategy was particularly evident at both ends of the drive train line-up: In the first nine months, the strongest growth came from BMW M models (+7.9%) and from electrified vehicles (+15%). In the year to the end of September, electrified models accounted for 26.2% of total sales (2024: 23.3%), with BEVs representing 18.0% (2024: 16.8%).\n\nIn Europe, electrified vehicles gained even higher shares: they made up no less than 40.9% (301,947 units) of all sales while fully-electric vehicles comprised a quarter during the same period (189,269 units; 25,5%).\n\nThe BMW Group expects further positive growth momentum in 2026 from the all-new BMW iX3*, the first model of the Neue Klasse.\n\n“The response to the BMW iX3 has been extremely positive: In Europe, new orders significantly exceed our expectations, confirming the strong customer interest,” said CEO Zipse. “With the Neue Klasse, we are making a major leap forward – in technology, driving experience and design. Our entire product line-up will benefit from these innovations within a short timeframe: Between now and 2027, we will bring 40 new and updated models to market – across all segments and drive train variants. Next year, we will already celebrate the next premiere, with the BMW i3, as we electrify the heart of BMW.”\n\nDuring the nine-month period, the BMW Group benefited from its globally balanced footprint, which helps the company offset differences in sales performance across key regions worldwide. Excluding Chinese sales, the BMW Group brands achieved growth of +8.2%, with solid increases in the key regions of Europe (+8.6%) and the Americas (+9.5%).\n\nIn the third quarter, the BMW Group posted revenues of € 32,314 million (Q3 2024: € 32,406 million/-0.3%, adjusted for currency translation effects +3.4%). Year-to-date at the end of September, revenues were lower than the previous year, at € 99,999 million (2024: € 105,964/-5.6%; adjusted for currency translation effects -3.9%).\n\nSignificantly lower R&D spending and capital expenditure\n\nAs previously announced, the BMW Group has transitioned from last year's record levels of future investment, which were required for electrification and digitalisation of the portfolio across all model series, as well as for development of the Neue Klasse.\n\nExpenditure for research and development was down significantly in the first nine months, at € 5,941 million (2024: € 6,642 million/-10.6%; Q3: € 1,921 million;Q3 2024: € 2,473 million/-22.3%) – despite the ongoing product offensive and ramped-up preparations for the first models of the Neue Klasse. The R&D ratio decreased to 5.9% in September MTD as well as YTD (2024: 6.3%/-0.4 percentage points; in Q3 2024: 7,6%).\n\nAs planned, capital expenditure was also significantly lower, at € 4,410 million for the nine-month period and € 1,674 million for the third quarter (2024: € 5,641 million/-21,8%; Q3 2024: € 2,185 million/-23,4%). The capex ratio stood at 4.4% for the year to the end of September and 5.2% for the third quarter (2024: 5.3%; Q3 2024: 6.7%).\n\nA capex ratio of less than 6% is forecast for the full year, moving closer to the company’s long-term target range of below 5%, as planned.\n\nThe BMW Group also achieved a moderate reduction in sales and administrative expenses, in line with forecasts, bringing costs down to € 6,077 million for the year to the end of September (2024: € 6,587 million/-7.7%; in Q3: € 1,995 million; Q3 2024: € 2,188 million/-8.8%).\n\n“As previously announced, this expenditure was lower than last year in every quarter. We are reaping the benefits of having invested in the future early, with the peak now already behind us. In the fourth quarter, we expect further cost reductions, as well as lower research and development spending and capital expenditure. We are systematically managing costs with a measured approach, aiming to continue delivering captivating, innovative premium vehicles – and being consistently profitable,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance.\n\nGroup pre-tax earnings exceed € 8.0 billion\n\nGroup earnings before tax (EBT) totalled € 8,056 million for the first nine months (2024: € 8,861 million/-9.1%)and € 2,329 million for the third quarter (Q3 2024: € 838 million).\n\nThe Group EBT margin came in at 8.1% for the YTD September and 7.2% for the third quarter (2024: 8.4%/-0.3 percentage points; Q3 2024: 2.6%/+4.6% percentage points). Group net profit amounted to € 5,712 million in the year to the end of September (2024: € 6,132 million/-6.8%; in Q3: € 1,697 million; Q3 2024: € 476 million).\n\nIn the first nine months, the Automotive Segment generated revenues of € 87,164 million (2024: € 90,863 million/-4.1%, adjusted for currency translation effects -2.2%; in Q3: € 28,510 million; Q3 2024: € 27,854 million/+2.4%, adjusted for currency translation effects +6.4%). Headwinds resulted from intensified global competition and financial measures aimed at supporting and strengthening dealer profitability in the challenging China market. Volume growth predominantly takes place there in the price segment below RMB 150,000 (~€ 18,000) and the growing product offer of local manufacturers leads to fierce competition across the entire market.\n\nAdditionally, negative currency translation effects, particularly from the US dollar, South Korean won and Chinese renminbi, have dampened income.\n\nThe segment’s earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 5,120 million for the first nine months (2024: € 6,028 million/-15.1%; Q3: € 1,494 million; Q32024: € 634 million/+135.6%). In the prior-year quarter, sales and revenues were affected by technical campaigns related to the Integrated Brake System (IBS).\n\nThe EBIT margin for the YTD September came in at 5.9% (2024: 6.6%/-0.7 percentage points; in Q3: 5.2%; Q3 2024: 2.3%/+2.9 percentage points).\n\nExcluding depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA of around 1.1 percentage points, the EBIT margin was 7.0% for the year to the end of September and 6.3% for the third quarter. Expenses resulting from higher import tariffs in the United States and the European Union further weighed on these margins: amounting to approx. 1.5 percentage points in the first nine months and around 1.75 percentage points in the third quarter.\n\nPre-tax earnings and lower capital expenditure boost free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow improved year-on-year, bolstered by higher cash inflows from operating activities, significantly lower investment activity (- € 1.4 billion) and reduced inventory levels, reaching € 2,688 million at the end of the nine-month period. In the third quarter, free cash flow totalled € 343 million (2024: - € 191 million; Q3 2024: - € 2,480 million). For the full year, the segment's free cash flow is now expected to be > € 2.5 billion (previously: > € 5 billion).\n\nThe BMW Group is implementing its share buyback programme with continuity and consistency: Following the renewed authorisation of the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025, the Board of Management has approved a third share buyback programme, with a volume of up to € 2 billion, to be completed by 30 April 2027. Acquisition of the first tranche of € 750 million began in May 2025 and will be completed no later than 8 December 2025.\n\nAs of 30 September 2025, BMW AG held more than 6.2 million treasury shares from the third buyback programme. Based on the authorisation granted at the Annual General Meeting of 14 May 2025, as of 30 September 2025, BMW AG had purchased shares equivalent to 1.01% of the share capital.\n\n“With the third share buyback programme since 2022, the BMW Group is consistently implementing its shareholder return strategy. We remain committed to our shareholders and stand by the announcements we have made. Our employee share programme will also continue,” said CFO Mertl. “At the same time, we are maintaining our payout ratio of 30-40% of net income attributable to BMW AG shareholders.”\n\nFinancial Services Segment sees continued new business growth\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the number of new financing and leasing contracts concluded in the first nine months of the year rose slightly to 1,275,607 (2024: 1,252,251 contracts/+1.9%). This significant growth in new business in the third quarter (450,935 contracts/+12.1%) was mainly due to a shift in the Chinese competitive landscape, where local banks have substantially reduced their commission rates for brokering financial and insurance products to retail customers.\n\nThe segment's volume of new business also increased slightly to € 48,500 million after nine months (2024: € 46,531 million/+4.2%). This reflects growth in new contracts, with a higher financing amount per contract. The penetration rate increased to 46.4% (2024: 42.3%/+4.1 percentage points).\n\nFor the year to the end of September, the segment reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 1,836 million (2024: € 2,146 million/-14.4%). This dampening effect was mainly due to lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, with the number of returned vehicles below the previous year's level. For the nine-month period, the credit loss ratio was in line with the previous year, at 0.26%, across the entire finance portfolio (2024: 0.26%).\n\nBMW Motorrad posts higher margin in YTD September\n\nWith 159,156 deliveries in the year to the end of September, BMW Motorrad achieved an EBIT margin of 10.8% (2024: 9.5%/+1.3 percentage points).\n\nFull-year guidance for 2025\n\nOn 7 October, the BMW Group adjusted its annual guidance for the following KPIs:\n\nDespite lower volume expectations for the Chinese market in the fourth quarter, the BMW Group is still targeting slight sales growth for the full year.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment, the EBIT margin for 2025 is still forecast to be within the guided target range of 5-7%, more specifically in the range of 5% to 6% in light of the earnings headwinds mentioned previously.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, Return on Equity is projected to be between 13-16%.\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%is forecast as before, with a RoCE of 13-17%. The segment is now anticipating a slight decrease in customer deliveries (previously: slight increase).\n\nThe BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from the expectations outlined above – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Risks to earnings could arise, among other factors, from changes in tariff policy or Chinese export restrictions affecting rare earths, battery cell production or semiconductors. At the same time, opportunities could result from a reduction in existing tariffs or a shorter period of validity. The company continues to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely.\n\nThe BMW Group will continue to benefit from its young and attractive product line-up and from its proven technology-neutral approach. At the same time, thanks to its flexibility, globally balanced footprint and strong financial position, the company is able to adapt to dynamic market conditions, while consistently pursuing long-term success.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: IN Q3 2025\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEmployees (as of 31 Dec. 2024)\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang.\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues.\n\n3 Common/preferred shares.

For details, please refer to the glossary in the BMW Group Report 2024.\n\nGLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle.\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nA new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.\n\nProfit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\nProfit/loss as a percentage of revenues.\n\nPlug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.\n\nReturn on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Finance Communications\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann, Head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nWith its four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services. The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide; the company has a global sales network in more than 140 countries.\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action.

Navarran artist Amaya Suberviola has won the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura for her work \"ST25061 (Coger una pestaña con los dedos)\" (Catching an eyelash with your fingers). In the Digital Art category, the award went to Madrid-based Chino Moya for his audiovisual piece \"Metapope\".\n\nWith this edition, the Premio BMW de Pintura celebrates four decades of uninterrupted commitment to culture and artistic talent, consolidating its position as one of the most prestigious competitions in Europe. Since its creation in 1986, the award has advanced the careers of more than 29,000 artists, helping to strengthen the ties between business, art and society.\n\n\"Art is a driver of transformation in thinking, and culture is an essential tool for the development of societies,\" said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, during his speech. \"Our support for art is not an isolated gesture, but a global commitment that seeks to build bridges between creativity, innovation and corporate citizenship.\"\n\nFor his part, Manuel Terroba, Executive President of the BMW Group for Spain and Portugal, emphasised that \"having reached forty editions is living proof that art and innovation, tradition and modernity, can go hand in hand.\" He added that \"the BMW Painting Prize has evolved with the times, opening up to new forms of expression such as digital art and becoming a showcase for diversity, innovation and excellence.\"\n\nA gala celebrating art The Teatro Real in Madrid was the venue for a gala presided over by Her Majesty Queen Sofía, at which more than 1,300 guests from the cultural, artistic and social spheres celebrated the 40th anniversary of this award. The BMW Group paid an emotional tribute to Her Majesty for her constant support of culture and the arts, as well as her commitment to social and humanitarian causes.\n\nThe BMW Group also paid tribute to Her Royal Highness Princess Irene of Greece, whose work at the helm of the Mundo en Armonía Foundation began at the same time as the Premio BMW de Pintura was created, in a clear commitment to bringing together art, culture and solidarity with the most disadvantaged.\n\nIn the same vein, and following the cessation of the Mundo en Armonía Foundation's activities last year, the BMW Group will donate the proceeds from the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura Gala to the Food Bank, with the aim of alleviating the vulnerability experienced by children.\n\nForty years of culture: a journey through Spanish creativityActor and BMW ambassador Álex González hosted the gala and, from the stage, highlighted the cultural significance of this anniversary:\"Forty years of Spanish history, of the evolution of our habits, our customs and our ways of seeing, living and creating. Because culture is not a luxury: it is a necessity. It is the soul of a people. It is what unites us when everything seems to divide us,\" he said.\n\nUnder this premise, the gala featured a musical show with the participation of the RTVE Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Salvador Vázquez, together with the Dúo del Valle, Antonio Najarro and José Mercé, who took an emotional journey through Spanish creation over the last four decades, from Falla to Manuel Alejandro, culminating in a performance of \"Se nos rompió el amor\" in tribute to Rocío Jurado.\n\nThe artist Alaska, responsible for one of the most acclaimed performances of the night, recalled her experiences and the cultural effervescence of 1980s Spain, the era in which the award was born, and defended the value of creativity as a hallmark of identity: \"La Movida did not end in the 1980s. It is revived every time an artist dares to challenge the status quo, and every time Spain reinvents itself. Because creativity here is not taught, it is breathed,\" she said.\n\nArt as a universal languageThis year's jury — made up of Antonio López, Miguel Zugaza, Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Guillermo Solana and Lucía Casani — selected the winners from among almost 2,000 artists of 38 nationalities, consolidating the Premio BMW de Pintura as a window onto the world and creative diversity.\n\nThe finalists in the painting category were José Ramón Amondarain Ubarrechena, Taxio Ardanaz Ruiz, Igor Arrieta Varela, Marta Beltrán Ferrer, Cristina Mejías Gómez, Simón Sepúlveda Braithwaite, and An Wei Lu Li.\n\nIn digital art, the finalists were Juan Carlos Bracho Jiménez, Amaya Hernández Sigüenza and Elisa Villota Sádaba.\n\nExhibition at Conde DuqueAll the finalists' works from the 40th edition will be on display for the first time at the Conde Duque Cultural Centre in Madrid from 20 November 2025 to the end of January 2026.\n\nThroughout its 40-year history, the BMW Painting Award has recognised artists such as Florencio Maíllo, Rafa Macarrón, Ángeles Agrela, Miki Leal, Santiago Ydáñez, Sonia Navarro and Damaris Pan, who have found in this competition a decisive boost to their careers.

It embodies the essence of a GS: Get on, twist the throttle, have fun - with full control and maximum confidence. Its low weight, superior performance and perfect balance between agility and stability ensure a particularly intuitive riding experience. Thanks to its precise handling and typical GS expertise, it performs impressively both on and off the road. The F 450 GS is the perfect 'best buddy' for every riding situation. It is uncomplicated, robust, and always ready. It sets the benchmark for sporty adventure bikes in its class.\" Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW F 450 GS: BMW GS expertise in the 48 hp A2 class in the iconic BMW GS design.The new BMW F 450 GS marks the next step in the GS model family, specifically addressing the 48 hp A2 class with proven GS technology and iconic design.\n\nAt the EICMA international motorcycle show, BMW Motorrad gave a preview of a fully-fledged GS model already in 2024, which specifically addresses the steadily growing market segment of medium-sized displacement motorcycles.\n\nThe series version of the BMW F 450 GS consistently lives up to this claim: It is a versatile all-rounder that combines everyday usability, sporty dynamic performance, touring comfort, and off-road capabilities. In the \"GS Trophy\" equipment variant, it follows in the footsteps of the concept vehicle. It adopts its striking design language and high-quality, high-tech components, including magnesium parts for maximum performance and low weight.\n\nWith its balanced power-to-torque ratio, low weight, and characteristic GS ergonomics, the F 450 GS provides riding fun and confidence from the first meter. The new F 450 GS thus combines the classic GS spirit with a modern, accessible, and simultaneously powerful approach.\n\n\"With the BMW F 450 GS, we are addressing a particularly broad target audience. This motorcycle is aimed at anyone who values ​​maximum agility, versatility, pure riding pleasure, and cutting-edge technology – regardless of whether they are on the road every day, on long tours, or simply looking for a light, dynamic, and uncomplicated bike. The current trend toward downsizing, i.e., switching from heavy motorcycles to compact and versatile machines, demonstrates the great interest in this segment. The F 450 GS offers the ideal combination of playful handling, maneuverability, riding dynamics, and high-quality equipment – ​​without compromising on quality or technical performance.”Astrid Neudecker, Product Manager BMW F 450 GS\n\nThe BMW Easy Ride Clutch (ERC) is a technical highlight and a further development of a centrifugal clutch. This system eliminates the need to manually operate the clutch lever while riding. This applies to all situations, from starting off and changing gears to demanding off-road maneuvers. BMW Motorrad is setting a new standard in this vehicle class.\n\nA range of attractive options will be added at the time of market launch: The F 450 GS can be equipped with an Akrapovic end muffler and original BMW Motorrad cross-spoke wheels on request. The result is a package that combines sporty dynamic performance, technical innovation and GS DNA perfectly.\n\nPerformance developed from scratch: A confident companion for both road and off-road riding.The completely redesigned BMW F 450 GS is a sporty adventure bike that complements the current BMW Motorrad model portfolio, with developers focusing on excellent handling characteristics, strong performance, durability, and optimum accessibility.\n\nThe design focuses on the consistent implementation of the current GS design language. With iconic features such as the LED headlight with \"X\" daytime riding light and the distinctive flyline, the bike's affiliation with the BMW Motorrad GS family is clear at first glance.\n\nCompletely redesigned, smooth-running and characterful two-cylinder in-line engine with 135-degree crankpin offset for dynamic riding pleasure on asphalt and off-road.At the heart of the new BMW F 450 GS is a completely newly developed two-cylinder in-line engine with fuel injection and a stainless steel exhaust system on the right-hand side. The new F 450 GS impresses with its powerful performance and pulling power, delivering a power output of 35 kW (48 hp) at 8,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 43 Nm at 6,750 rpm.Thanks to the use of high-tech materials and optimized internal friction, these performance values are achieved with exactly 420 cm³. This makes the engine one of the most compact and powerful in the A2 two-cylinder segment. It not only meets the strict EU5+ requirements but is also particularly economical, consuming just 3.8 liters per 100 km. A range of over 350 km can be achieved in conjunction with the 14-liter tank. The maintenance interval is the standard 10,000 km for BMW motorcycles.\n\nUnique on the motorcycle market, the engine features a crankshaft with crankpins offset by 135 degrees and, in conjunction with a single balance shaft, sets a technical exclamation mark: this design ensures a characterful, emotional ride while simultaneously reducing unwanted vibrations to an exceptionally low level.\n\nEasy Ride Clutch (ERC) for a significant increase in dynamics, operating comfort, and riding comfort.A technical highlight of the new BMW F 450 GS is the Easy Ride Clutch (ERC). Its core is a precision centrifugal unit in the clutch, which engages the clutch depending on engine speed.\n\nThis system is standard on the GS Trophy variant and available as an optional accessory for all other model variants. In combination with the Shift Assistant Pro, manual operation of the clutch lever is completely eliminated – from starting off and gear changes to demanding maneuvers.\n\nThe clutch lever, however, remains intact and allows the rider to intervene manually at any time if necessary – for example, to lift the front wheel over an obstacle or to improve control when descending on slippery surfaces.\n\nTechnologically, the ERC is based on an advanced centrifugal clutch. Unlike conventional systems, it remains closed during overrun. This creates natural, familiar, and predictable handling at all times – comparable to a conventional clutch. The engine brake remains fully active until just before a stop; only when the idle speed is reached does the ERC automatically open, reliably preventing the engine from stalling.\n\nThe system ensures greater dynamics, control, and comfort – whether maneuvering, in city traffic, on winding roads, or off-road.\n\nSix-speed transmission and left-mounted secondary drive. Shift Assistant Pro for quick upshifts and downshifts without clutch operation.The likewise newly designed six-speed transmission transmits torque to the left-hand secondary drive via an X-ring chain.For fast upshifts and downshifts without clutch operation, the new F 450 GS is offered with Shift Assistant Pro in all equipment variants except the basic variant. This can be retrofitted to the basic version.\n\n\"Rain,\" \"Road,\" and \"Enduro\" riding modes, as well as ABS Pro, DBC, DTC, and MSR (engine drag control), are standard features for a high level of riding enjoyment and safety. An additional \"Enduro Pro\" riding mode is available starting with the Exclusive trim variant.The BMW F 450 GS offers three riding modes as standard: \"Rain\", \"Road\" and \"Enduro\", allowing the motorcycle to be adapted to suit individual preferences. Standard equipment also includes ABS Pro, Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and engine drag torque control (MSR).\n\nThe additional “Enduro Pro” mode, which is used from the Exclusive equipment variant onwards, is designed for off-road use with coarse-tread off-road tires and allows the ABS on the rear wheel to be deactivated.\n\nNewly developed chassis with tubular steel frame for optimal rigidity, robustness, and driving precision. Short wheelbase for agile and playful handling.The new BMW F 450 GS also features a completely new chassis concept. Playful handling, optimum accessibility, high riding precision and riding stability were the developers' top priorities. The specially developed lattice-tube frame of the BMW F 450 GS consists of welded steel tubes and forged parts. The frame integrates the two-cylinder in-line engine as a supporting element and is designed to be lightweight yet robust.\n\nThe front wheel is guided via KYB upside-down telescopic forks, while the rear wheel is guided via an aluminum hollow cast double armed swinging arm with a KYB central spring strut featuring progressive damping.Front wheel control is provided by a torsionally rigid KYB upside-down telescopic fork with a 43 mm inner tube diameter. The Sport and GS Trophy variants feature the so-called \"sports suspension.\" The fork is adjustable for rebound and compression damping. Rear wheel control is provided by a closed, and therefore extremely torsionally rigid, yet lightweight, hollow-cast aluminum double-sided swing arm, coupled with a directly connected KYB central spring strut (adjustable spring preload and rebound damping) with travel-dependent damping derived from rally racing, a unique feature in this segment.\n\nWheels and tires tailored to the typical BMW GS applications.The new BMW F 450 GS features lightweight yet robust cast aluminum wheels. It is fitted with tubeless tires for road and off-road use, sized 100/90-19 at the front and 130/80-17 at the rear. Additionally, the Original BMW Motorrad Accessories range offers cross-spoke wheels.\n\nA powerful braking system combined with BMW Motorrad ABS Pro ensures safe braking even when leaning. Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) and Dynamic Brake Light are additional safety features.The front wheel of the new BMW F 450 GS features a floating single-disc brake with a Brembo 4-piston fixed caliper and a 310 mm brake disc diameter for superior, stable deceleration. A single disc brake with 1-piston floating caliper and 240 mm diameter is used on the rear wheel.\n\nThe new BMW F 450 GS already comes standard with BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. ABS Pro also offers increased safety when braking in curves by enabling ABS-assisted braking while leaning. Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) offers increased safety when braking, even in difficult situations, by preventing unintentional throttle application. The dynamic brake light effectively alerts following vehicles to the braking motorcycle ahead.\n\nOptimal ergonomics and equipment for comfortable, playful, and agile motorcycling on and off-road.A sophisticated ergonomic triangle and a high, close-to-the-body handlebar made of tapered aluminum tubing ensure an ideal riding position in all conditions. The body and the 14-liter fuel tank below it are designed for optimal support and good knee contact, both when seated and while standing off-road. A wide range of accessories are available to meet the individual needs of riders, including a handlebar riser, a rally seat, and the option of a low seat.\n\nThree different seat variants, adjustable hand levers, a handlebar riser, and secure footrests with height-adjustable gearshift and footbrake levers ensure optimal riding comfort both on and off-road.The new BMW F 450 GS comes with a two-part seat (845 mm) as standard.

After an intensive year, the “Class of 2025” has completed the BMW M Racing Academy - BMW M Motorsport’s dedicated support program for talented young drivers from customer racing. Under the close guidance of a team led by three BMW M works drivers, Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP), Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER) have received comprehensive training and support from BMW M Motorsport over the past months. Following the successful launch of the program, anticipation is already high for the “Class of 2026.”\n\nTo conclude their BMW M Racing Academy year, the four members of the “Class of 2025” spent a full week immersed in the world of BMW M Motorsport. At BMW’s headquarters in Munich (GER), Besler, Martí, Million, and Tröger enjoyed a guided tour of BMW Welt and the BMW Museum. They then participated in workshops on social media and brand building – and immediately put their new skills to the test: the group documented their joint road trip to Viareggio (ITA) in a BMW M5 for BMW M Motorsport’s official Instagram channel.\n\nIn Viareggio, the quartet once again trained with Formula Medicine – as they had at the beginning of the year – focusing on both their mental and physical performance. Under the professional supervision of Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his globally renowned team, the participants assessed their progress since the program’s start and evaluated their development. The “Class of 2025” also completed a 24-hour race simulation together, gaining firsthand experience of the procedures, challenges, and demands of endurance racing.\n\nThroughout the year, the four drivers accumulated many valuable test kilometers on real racetracks. In Miramas (FRA) and Varano (ITA), they worked side by side with BMW M works drivers on development testing for the new BMW M2 Racing. Martí and Besler also gained insights into BMW M Motorsport’s factory programs by attending the FIA WEC weekend in Imola (ITA), where they met Head of BMW M Motorsport, Andreas Roos and several works drivers. Meanwhile, Million joined BMW M Motorsport at the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship round in Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nThe participants were mentored throughout the year by a trio of BMW M works drivers. Jens Klingmann (GER) served as the main point of contact for the “Class of 2025,” supported by Max Hesse (GER) and Robby Foley (USA). The team was completed by Dirk Adorf (GER), who brought his extensive experience from previous talent development programs. Together, they provided expert guidance both on and off the track, offering invaluable advice, analysis, and feedback. Their presence at the participants’ GT4 customer racing events provided an especially valuable learning opportunity through direct, hands-on coaching.\n\nBesler, Martí, Tröger, and Million had earned their places in the Academy after a demanding selection process against a strong field of GT4 drivers last year. The selection for the second generation is already underway – and following the program’s successful debut, everyone involved is eagerly looking forward to the “Class of 2026.”\n\nStatements on the BMW M Racing Academy.\n\nBjörn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: “I’m extremely proud that we were able to establish this development program again this year. Supporting talent from the customer racing sector is something both BMW M Motorsport and I personally care deeply about. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, the four participants made important contributions to development work, benefitting everyone involved. It was fascinating to watch how our ‘Class of 2025’ evolved both on and off the track. My thanks go to our BMW M works drivers Jens, Max, and Robby for their intense and constructive mentoring, which makes this program so special. We’re all very eager to continue following the progress of Berkay, Nerea, Matt, and Niels. After such a strong debut year, I’m very excited to see what the next generation of the BMW M Racing Academy will bring in 2026.”\n\nJens Klingmann, BMW M works driver: “It was great that, in the second half of the year, we were able to dive deep into the DNA of BMW – the values, the core business, the history, and the future – to broaden the participants’ understanding as drivers and give them a bigger-picture view. At the start of the program, we worked with Formula Medicine to assess each participant’s physical and mental baseline, and from there we built personalized training plans. Seeing their progress over the year was very rewarding. The 24-hour simulation was also crucial for teaching how to approach such an event, manage rest periods, and recover both mentally and physically. For drivers without prior endurance experience, that’s a real eye-opener. Overall, my impression is extremely positive. It was a lot of fun, and we were able to give the participants behind-the-scenes insights that money can’t buy. I’m happy that we could always be there for them – whether analyzing onboard footage, answering questions, or sharing advice. I wish all four of them the very best and hope they can apply everything they’ve learned in the BMW M Racing Academy to their future careers, both on and off the track.”\n\nBerkay Besler, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “Racing for a brand like BMW is already something very special to me, but being part of the BMW family through the Academy made it even more meaningful. Having such close contact with all members of this big organization was incredibly valuable. The relationship with the three mentors was essential – especially since I’ve known Max for a long time and could exchange ideas with him throughout the year. I also spent a lot of time with Jens during the BMW M2 Racing tests, and his influence on my performance has been huge. After every test, we wrote reports to share with him, and after every race, I did race reports with my engineer – something I had never done before. It really helps us improve and analyze our weaknesses. I’ve also adapted my nutrition and training routines based on what I learned at Formula Medicine and use mental techniques during races to enhance my focus. All these experiences will be crucial for my future racing career.”\n\nNerea Martí, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy provided me with a complete preparation both on and off the track. I’m very grateful for the close connection to BMW and the opportunity to learn from everyone involved. I’ve learned to pay attention to small details and to plan my development strategically – from physical and mental preparation to communication and social media presence. The program has taught me how to prepare properly off the track, apply the right training methods, and balance physical and mental aspects to deliver my best performance. The chance to interact with our mentors and everyone involved in the program was incredibly valuable. Their experience, advice, and feedback had a big impact on my growth as a driver, and I’m confident that their guidance will continue to help me in the future.”\n\nMatt Million, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “My key takeaways fall into three categories: professionalism, performance, and in-depth knowledge of BMW M and BMW M Motorsport. The mentors in particular gave me a clear understanding of how to act as a BMW M driver and brand ambassador, both on and off the track. The conversations with Robby Foley and Max Hesse helped me build a framework for planning my next career steps. Overall, the program elevated me in every aspect as a driver and ambassador – from physical and mental training to recovery and team feedback. I’ve also started using media and interview opportunities much more effectively to represent myself and the brand. Sharing my story from the BMW M Racing Academy and my journey feels special. Representing the brand I raced with for years in club racing is personally a magical story for me.”\n\nNiels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy has given me insights into professional motorsport that you wouldn’t normally get. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, I gained my first experience in race car development, and working directly with the engineers was unique and highly educational. With the help of our mentors, especially Jens, I’ve learned how to give precise feedback to my race engineer. Thanks to our Formula Medicine training, I now prepare for races in a completely different way and can perform much better. All these important experiences have helped me develop further as a driver. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy has made me a more complete racer.”\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Sedan: energy consumption weighted combined: 17,6–17,2 kWh/100 km and 5–4,8 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 114–108 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B.

Comfortably rest your hands in your lap and initiate overtaking maneuvers with a glance in the wing mirror – BMW customers will soon be able to experience this in many more European countries with the Motorway Assistant*. The BMW Group is the first car manufacturer in Germany to receive approval for driver assistance systems for the new BMW iX3 in accordance with UN Regulation No. 171 for Driver Control Assistance Systems (DCAS). The DCAS regulation provides an international legal framework for innovative Level 2 driver assistance systems with a focus on customer safety. The approval enables the BMW Group to offer the Motorway Assistant* with Level 2 \"hands-off\" function in numerous other models and countries in the future, as well as with an extended range of functions. Further innovative assistance functions will also follow for urban driving scenarios. The current generation of the Motorway Assistant has just been awarded the Tech Award in the \"Comfort assistance systems\" category by the German car magazine \"auto motor und sport\".\n\nDr. Mihiar Ayoubi, Senior Vice President Driving Experience Development:\n\n\"The safety-oriented DCAS-regulation ensures that we can launch our Motorway Assistant with hands-off function in many more countries. Further innovative assistance systems with our special, symbiotic approach between vehicle and driver will follow. We are creating a perfect interplay between rule-based algorithms and artificial intelligence. The driver remains involved, our systems are controllable at all times, and their behaviour is reproducible.\"\n\nWhen the Motorway Assistant is activated, drivers can take their hands off the steering wheel permanently at speeds of up to 130 km/h, but must remain attentive and ready to intervene. The system assists with vehicle guidance within its own lane and can also change lanes automatically if necessary - all the driver needs to do is confirm this with a glance. The new DCAS approval also enables even more extensive functions. With active BMW Maps route guidance, the system suggests a lane change in good time at Motorway junctions and exits, which can be confirmed with a glance in the wing mirror. The Motorway Assistant remains active when driving through freeway junctions and until the end of freeway exits. This means that drivers of the BMW iX3 can enjoy Level 2 driver assistance in even more situations without touching the steering wheel.\n\nThe new Motorway and City Assistant* of the BMW iX3 also offers innovative functions for urban areas. At market launch in Germany, these include stopping at red lights and driving off again automatically. Further driver assistance functions for complex driving situations in urban areas will be rolled out at a later point in time via over-the-air software updates.\n\nThe Motorway Assistant of the previous technology generation celebrated its premiere in the current 5 Series Sedan in 2023. The BMW Group had received a limited exemption from the Federal Motor Transport Authority in Germany for the approval of the system. With DCAS approval, exemptions are no longer required, and the systems can be offered throughout Europe and in other ECE countries.\n\nBMW Symbiotic Drive: next-generation symbiotic driver assistance.\n\nIn addition to the new possibilities offered by the DCAS regulation for driver assistance systems, the BMW Group continues to consistently design its systems so that driver and driver assistance work together symbiotically. BMW Symbiotic Drive creates a seamless transition between assistance and driver input and reaches the next level of development in the “Neue Klasse” vehicles. In addition to symbiotic steering, the BMW iX3 is the world's first model with symbiotic brakes. With active driver assistance, the driver can influence the system individually at any time according to their wishes by lightly intervening in steering and braking without switching off the driver assistance. The system remains active to provide support. The innovative power of the symbiotic brake is underpinned by more than two dozen BMW Group patent applications resulting from the development of these technologies.\n\n* The Highway & City Assistant will be available in Germany for market launch of the BMW iX3. Other countries and functions will follow. The availability, range of functions and system limits of the Highway & City Assistant may vary from country to country.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."}

Following its successful appearance at ApeFest 2024 in Lisbon, BMW was also in attendance at this year’s edition of the Web3 tech community event. This latest chapter in its collaboration with the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) community strengthened the connection between digital culture, technology and lifestyle. ApeFest 2025 took place on 24 October at first-time venue Las Vegas, and included a close-quarters tie-up with the ComplexCon event (25 – 26 October) fusing street culture, fashion, art and technology.\n\n“We’re delighted to be collaborating with the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). The partnership gives us the opportunity to drive forward the digital transformation ‘in BMW style’ and to further expand our Web3 knowledge. And this, in turn, will create a playground for innovative brand and product experiences from BMW,” says Ulrike von Mirbach, Vice President, BMW Customer Formats and Brand Experiences.\n\nApeFest is an annual event hosted by the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). It primarily attracts owners of digital goods known as NFTs, which are based on the cutting-edge blockchain technology also playing an important role at BMW. The BAYC is one of the most renowned NFT collections held by US firm Yuga Labs and comprises a total of 10,000 unique digital collector's items depicting stylized ape motifs. ApeFest is aimed at a highly tech-savvy community of people fuelled by extraordinary creative energy and an insatiable thirst for innovation – making this an ideal match-up for the BMW brand. The community gathers at ApeFest to connect and shape the future of Web3 technology, to gain access to exclusive digital content and experiences, and to develop new business ideas. BMW lined up as a partner of the event once again this year – and shone its Las Vegas spotlight on three key themes:\n\nIn-car gaming becomes part of the driving experience. BMW, in collaboration with AirConsole and Bandai Namco, has developed the exclusive PAC-MAN Championship Edition* game for its vehicles. In this unique iteration, the iconic PAC-MAN sets out to collect cars such as a BMW M Baby Racer and a BMW XM Label, along with items from the BMW M Lifestyle Collection.\n\nThe game was premiered at ApeFest as an AirConsole experience in a BMW XM Label. With PAC-MAN celebrating the 45th anniversary of its classic debut, this ranks as a headline collaboration. The BMW XM Label, renowned for its blend of performance, extrovert character and technology, effectively becomes the stage for this legendary game. Following its launch at ApeFest, the PAC-MAN Championship Edition* will be made available across all suitably specified BMW models.\n\nThis roll-out allows players to fully immerse themselves in the world of PAC-MAN directly in their vehicle, highlighting a tangible link between vehicle technology, entertainment and digital innovation.\n\nBMW already offers a range of games with AirConsole, providing a premium in-car entertainment experience. A key feature here is the use of smartphones as controllers; players simply scan a QR code on the vehicle's display to connect. The system creates a unique and seamless gaming experience, even supporting a multiplayer mode that allows up to seven people to play together, turning the car into a mobile arcade for the whole family.\n\n*PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition & ©Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.\n\nBMW Lifestyle Collection takes a turn for the digital.Another focal point at ApeFest was the presentation of the new BMW M Collection, which has been customised by the company’s collaboration partner and carries Bored Ape Bimmer Club (BABC) branding.\n\nThe Collection was revealed as part of a live show fronted by animated 3D character “Max”, BMW’s very own digital ape. With a presentation big on charm and innovation, Max acted as a model bridging real-world fashion and digital experience.\n\nQR codes transported visitors directly to the Collection’s product pages. The interplay of physical and digital elements created a new form of brand showcase – open, authentic and technologically on point.\n\nThe art installation: design as a shared experience. BMW also made a statement with a live performance by the artist Pauser (@Pausrr), who turned 24 black BMW suitcases into large-format graffiti art. Each of the suitcases was designed individually and personalised with e.g. initials and personal symbols, making it a one-off collector’s item that was then sold.\n\nThe installation embodied the themes of identity, mobility and design. And the standalone individual pieces were arranged into a complex artwork that underscored once again the community-led character of the initiative.\n\nPerformance meets digital culture. BMW was also represented at the event by an exclusive VIP fleet of vehicles including the BMW XM Label and BMW X7. Another star of ApeFest was a strikingly styled BMW M3 from the BMW Performance Center USA (Thermal), which served as a content studio for creators, media and guests. The high-performance model became a hotspot for video, photos and interviews focusing on design, technology and lifestyle. This was a place where product experiences and digital communication overlapped.\n\nThe BMW presence in Las Vegas was designed as an open-ended brand platform – with zones for gaming, fashion, art and connecting. The result was a space emphasising interaction and the sharing of ideas over traditional product presentations. Classic cars from the regional BMW community – members from southern California showed off their pride and joy at AREA15 – provided a bridge between the past and the future.\n\nBy hooking up with ApeFest once again, BMW has strengthened its presence in a space that mixes technological and cultural trends – and provided another demonstration of how mobility, lifestyle and digital culture can engage and connect with one another."}

BMW and MINI will be hosting attention-grabbing stands at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Taking to the stage in Tokyo on 31 October – 9 November will be a host of future-focused BMW and MINI models and technologies, including the first new Neue Klasse model BMW iX3, hydrogen fuel cell technology, the MINI family including new MINI Paul Smith Edition, the special-edition BMW M2 CS* and the BMW Concept Speedtop concept car. BMW Motorrad will also be represented at the event – in the form of the fully electric BMW CE 02 and the BMW M 1000 RR ridden by Toprak Razgatlıoğlu to his second successive FIM Superbike World Championship crown in 2025. On 29 and 30 October, representatives of the international media will have an early opportunity to take in the compelling exhibits from the three brands at the 1,100-square-metre stand in Tokyo’s Big Sight exhibition centre. Visitors to the show can also experience in-car gaming with AirConsole, which is making its debut with BMW Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will be among the vehicles offering customers this function, which brings with it world-renowned titles such as UNO® Car Party!, Hot Wheels: Xtreme OverdriveTM and PAC-MANTM Championship Edition.\n\nAsian premiere for the new BMW iX3, the first new Neue Klasse model.\n\nThe Japan Mobility Show will host the Asian premiere of the first new Neue Klasse model: the BMW iX3. Lining up alongside the iX3 will be revolutionary technologies that point the way to the future of the BMW Group as a whole. Visitors to the Japan Mobility Show will see the new BMW iX3 reveal technological leaps forward in a host of different areas: electric mobility, display and control/operation concept, digitalisation, connectivity, design and sustainability. All future BMW models will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue Klasse – regardless of the type of drive system they use.\n\nProduction of the BMW iX3 for Japan is scheduled to begin in March 2026, with sales through the Japanese BMW dealer network currently due to begin in the second half of 2026. The BMW iX3 launches an all-new design language for the BMW brand that faithfully conveys the technological advances achieved. The revolutionary display and control/operation concept BMW Panoramic iDrive with the new BMW Panoramic Vision and new BMW Operating System X redefines the user experience and creates flawless driver orientation in the BMW mould. The zonal electronics architecture featuring four high-performance computers – the “superbrains” – provides the basis for the software-defined vehicle. One of these high-performance computers is the Heart of Joy: with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed fully in-house, it can manage the driving characteristics of the overall vehicle from a standstill to the dynamic limit. As the first new Neue Klasse model – with sixth-generation (Gen6) BMW eDrive, cylindrical-cell battery and new electric motors – the new BMW iX3 embodies major technological progress. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables 372 km (231 miles) of range to be added in ten minutes, and bidirectional charging functions turn the car into a powerbank on wheels.\n\nThe new BMW iX5 Hydrogen* from 2028.\n\nProduct diversity continues to be a key success factor for the BMW Group. A wide-ranging portfolio of drive systems – encompassing internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive systems and, starting with the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen in 2028, hydrogen fuel cell technology – lays the foundations for successfully meeting the varying demands and needs of customers worldwide both now and in the future.\n\nThe hydrogen drive technology is based on the third-generation fuel cell system that the BMW Group is developing in collaboration with the Toyota Motor Corporation. This technological advance paves the way for a system with a more compact design that is also more powerful and efficient, thereby increasing range and output at the same time as reducing energy consumption. Competence centres in Munich and at BMW Group Plant Steyr are building initial prototypes for this technology. And BMW Group Plant Landshut is supplying additional components for the drive system.\n\nWorld premiere for the MINI Paul Smith Edition.\n\nBack in 1998, Paul Smith lent his signature to a limited-run edition of the classic Mini. And MINI and the British designer have since linked up to bring a number of other projects to fruition. Fast forward to the present day and the Japan Mobility Show 2025 will provide the setting for the latest milestone in this tradition-steeped collaboration: the world premiere of the new MINI Paul Smith Edition. For this special-edition car, Paul Smith brings his world-renowned “classic with a twist” design language to the MINI Cooper family. The styling and details of the cars bring together the unmistakable style of Paul Smith with the playful, upbeat and independent spirit of the MINI brand.\n\nExclusive exterior colours such as Nottingham Green and sophisticated design elements like the Paul Smith “signature stripe” accentuate the distinctive looks of the MINI Paul Smith Edition. Standard specification for the MINI Paul Smith Edition includes 18-inch Night Flash Spoke black alloy wheels with accents in Dark Steel. And a Paul Smith signature on the wheel trims and black horizontal boot lid handle marks out the special-edition cars. The MINI Paul Smith Edition will be offered for the MINI Cooper 3-Door, 5-Door and MINI Cooper Convertible models. Worldwide sales of the fully electric variants of the MINI Paul Smith Edition will get underway with the world premiere at the Japan Mobility Show, while orders for variants with an internal combustion engine will open in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nJapan premiere for the special-edition BMW M2 CS.\n\nThe special-edition BMW M2 CS is celebrating its Japanese premiere at the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Its high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinTurbo technology – an upgraded version of the unit found in the standard M2 – develops an impressive 390 kW/530 hp at 6,250 rpm. In so doing, the compact high-performance sports car from BMW M GmbH raises the bar for undiluted driving pleasure a notch higher still.\n\nThe standard-fitted eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic sends the engine’s power to the rear wheels of the BMW M2 CS. Judicious application of lightweight design techniques including the use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) reduces the weight of the special edition by around 30 kilograms compared to the standard M2. Thanks to the car’s lighter weight and lightning-fast power delivery, the BMW M2 CS is able to break the four-second barrier for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) with a time of 3.8 seconds. The figure calculated using the “1-foot rollout” method** is 3.5 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 3.4 seconds and top speed is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph). The chassis technology and braking system of the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the uprated performance characteristics of the engine and the specific weight balance of the special edition, which has an eight-millimetre-lower ride height.\n\nThe striking exterior of the BMW M2 CS is headlined by a host of components made from CFRP and exclusive details such as the M exterior mirror caps familiar from the BMW M2*, the M Carbon roof – which comes as standard on the special-edition model – and the CS-specific rear diffusor. The interior of the new BMW M2 CS combines an exclusive look with the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara and innovative lightweight design, examples of which include the CFRP centre console and the weight-optimised, heated M Carbon front bucket seats finished in Merino leather.\n\nWith in-car gaming via AirConsole, users can enjoy world-renowned classic titles.\n\nVisitors to the BMW Group stand in Tokyo can also experience in-car gaming via AirConsole, as introduced for the first time with BMW Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will offer this feature, which comes with world-renowned titles like the classic card game UNO® from Mattel – here tailored for in-car gaming and renamed “UNO® Car Party!”. Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) is a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world.\n\nBMW customers also gain exclusive access to the Hot Wheels: Xtreme OverdriveTM game that AirConsole – in collaboration with Mattel – has added to its game library. In this game, players can earn points with the virtual BMW Vision Neue Klasse X in races on the Panoramic Drive Track, unlock legendary Hot Wheels cars and customize them. This makes every race a showcase for the performance and style of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X.\n\nAt the same time, AirConsole will also release PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition from Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. to BMW for the first time. This brand-specific version of the arcade classic has been customized with exclusive BMW items, bringing a unique twist to one of the world’s best known games. AirConsole allows customers to use their smartphones as controllers so that all the passengers on board can play against each other.\n\nBMW Concept Speedtop: the sports Touring, redefined.\n\nAdding a particularly exclusive head-turner to the vehicles on display at the BMW Group’s Japan Mobility Show 2025 stand is the unique BMW Concept Speedtop. This three-door concept car was unveiled for the first time in May this year at the Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy. The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring model type, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with a fresh design language. The exclusivity of the BMW Concept Speedtop (which will be offered in a strictly limited-run small series of 70 cars) is underscored by its exquisite engine – the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.\n\nThe exterior of the BMW Concept Speedtop is marked out by the pronounced V-shape of the “shark-nose” front end, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidneys. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler imbues the car with a dynamic Touring profile, its broad haunches further enriching the athletic design. And its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke fan-style wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop. A two-tone colour and materials concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tones of the Floating Sunstone Maroon exterior paint finish are carried over into the cabin in the form of the brown Sundown Maroon colour world with the light Moonstone White of the seats. In addition, skilfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and visualise the manufactory-level craftsmanship on display. The boot of the BMW Concept Speedtop is also leather-covered and adorned with brogue-style perforations. The elaborate craftsmanship of the exterior and interior was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing.\n\nBMW X7 meets Japanese craftsmanship.\n\nThe BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge concept car presented at the Japan Mobility Show embodies the elegant symbiosis of luxurious driving comfort and traditional Japanese craftsmanship. With space for up to seven people, this attractive concept model based on the BMW X7 also offers high practicality. A tranquil space filled with beauty, where stars twinkle, the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge creates a gentle, expansive sanctuary. Here in the cabin, the refined brilliance of BMW's exclusive appointments is artistically combined with the vast expanse of a starry sky, crafted using traditional Kyoto techniques.\n\nA dedicated two-tone paint scheme instantly conveys the exclusive aura of the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge. Complementing the main colour BMW Individual Velvet Blue, the roof section is painted in Space Silver to evoke the shimmer of nebulae shining in the cosmos. The Crystal Light Headlights emit an infinite, jewel-like brilliance, enhanced by gentle Iconic Glow light. The interior features a Panoramic Skyroof with 15,000 LEDs projecting a pale blue starlight at night, while the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System expresses the light shining on the earth through sound.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: Energy consumption combined (WLTP): 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: (WLTP): 0 g/km; CO2 class: A BMW iX5 Hydrogen: As this is a development-phase prototype, energy consumption information according to WLTP is not available yet.

Paul Smith and MINI – two traditional British brands have taken their partnership to the next level and created something great: The new MINI Paul Smith Edition. Following the MINI STRIP in 2021 and the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith in 2022, the British designer is now bringing his world-famous design language – ‘Classic with a twist’ – to the new MINI family. Whether electric or combustion engine, the edition will be available for all MINI Cooper 3-door, 5-door and Convertible models, with the exception of the John Cooper Works models. The look and details not only show Paul Smith’s signature style — but also the brands playful, optimistic and independent spirit. The MINI Paul Smith Edition celebrates its world premiere on October 29 at Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo.\n\n“It’s not often that you see two icons of British design work together in this way and it’s wonderful that our partnership has carried on over so many years. The MINI Paul Smith Edition has been a real privilege and a wonderful opportunity… new colours and new unexpected details that will be a welcomed surprise,” adds Sir Paul Smith, expressing his thoughts on the collaboration and the new design.\n\nUnmistakable look with a British twist.Combining MINI design with Paul Smith’s distinctive style: Exclusive exterior colours, sophisticated accents and unexpected details bring the shared history of MINI and Paul Smith into the present.\n\n\"MINI and Paul Smith embody a shared mindset of positivity, embracing the motto of this edition: 'Every day is a new beginning.' Our collaboration celebrates a mutual love for design and meticulous attention to detail. Unexpected elements, such as the 'hello' projection on the ground and Paul Smith’s handwritten inscription bring a smile to your face right upon entering the car,\" says Holger Hampf, Head of MINI Design.\n\nThe MINI Paul Smith Edition offers a choice of three exterior paint finishes, two of which are edition-exclusive: Statement Grey is a modern interpretation of the classic Mini Austin Seven colour from 1959 – a clear, bluish-tinted grey shade and self-confident statement of timeless modernity. Inspired White is a contemporary homage to the popular Classic Mini Beige colour, and finally the elegant and classic Midnight Black Metallic from the current MINI Family.\n\nRegardless of the body colour, the specially created Nottingham Green paintwork – a tribute to Sir Paul's hometown – adds sophisticated accents to the side mirrors, the octagonal radiator grille, the wheel hub covers with Paul Smith lettering and as the paintwork for one of the two roof variants.\n\nIn addition to the colour variants, numerous details characterise Paul Smith's signature and make the MINI Paul Smith Edition unmistakable: The ‘Signature Stripe’, a central design feature of the British designer, adorns the roof in Nottingham Green at the rear of the driver's side. The alternative version of the roof features elegant stripes in Jet Black in varying thickness, both matte and glossy. The MINI Cooper Convertible Paul Smith Edition is supplied with a black soft top.\n\nAll edition vehicles are equipped with 18-inch Night Flash Spoke black aluminium wheels with tinted clear coat in Dark Steel. The MINI logo at the front and rear is offered in newly designed Black Blue and complements the colour composition of Paul Smith and MINI. On the black horizontal handle strip at the rear, Paul Smith's signature refers to the creative spirit behind the vehicle design.\n\nBritish restraint and elegance in the interior.\n\nBritish character is also reflected in the interior with numerous components featuring a modern, elegant look. The knitted surfaces on the dashboard and door panels appear in black, while Paul Smith fabrics in tone-on-tone stripe patterns serve as inspiration for the special structure of the dashboard. The Nightshade Blue sports seats are made of Vescin and have knitted textile in the shoulder and headrest areas. Drawn from the Signature Stripe, the decorative stitching on the steering wheel's textile band is designed in bright colours - quintessentially Paul Smith.\n\nThe round display in the centre of the cockpit also appears with one of three different Paul Smith backgrounds when Personal Mode is selected. Small hidden details underline the British design influence - but also the playful character of the designer: when the door is opened, the driver and front passenger are greeted with a handwritten ‘Hello’ as a light projection on the floor and Smith's motto ‘Every day is a new beginning’ on the door sill, reflecting the positive mindset of both brands. A graphic of a stylized ‘rabbit’ hand-drawn by Paul Smith on the floor mat complete the interior details.\n\nA collaboration that blends British heritage, bold creativity and contemporary sophistication.MINI and Sir Paul Smith: two icons that are not only linked by their British heritage but also look back on exclusive collaborations resulting in unique styling. Their joint creative success story began in 1998, when the designer created a limited edition of the classic Mini: a specially created blue colour and matching anthracite-coloured alloy wheels lent the iconic model the signature of Paul Smith.\n\nTo mark the 40th birthday of the classic MINI in 1999, the fashion designer dipped an exclusive one-off in his characteristic stripe design, using 86 stripes in 26 colours.\n\nIn 2021, the MINI STRIP celebrated its world premiere: a vehicle designed using only what Paul Smith considered absolutely necessary. The result was a customised one-off car that despite its minimalist design and in keeping with Smith's guiding principle of ‘classic with a twist’, was not without unexpected and loving details.\n\nIn 2022, Paul Smith went back to the roots of the collaboration with the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith. A classic found its way into the now: a Classic Mini from the 1998 MINI Paul Smith Edition was transformed into a modernised electric vehicle. With a focus on quality and functionality, a contemporary vehicle was created that can also be seen as a tribute to the tradition and heritage of the classic MINI.\n\nPaul Smith MINI Collection But it is not only Sir Paul Smith who inspires MINI with creative ideas - the inspiration also works in reverse: the designer repeatedly uses MINI as a motif on exclusive pieces in his collections. To celebrate the launch of the MINI Paul Smith Edition, Paul Smith will release a capsule collection of bags inspired by details from the latest MINI collaboration.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption combined: 14.7 - 14.1 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 385 - 400)."}

Now it’s time to reap the rewards for the hard work put in throughout the season. Our BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers in North America have done this in an incredibly impressive fashion. A huge congratulations and sincere compliments to Random Vandals Racing, Turner Motorsport, and BimmerWorld Racing, who achieved a clean sweep in the SRO series with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and BMW M4 GT4 EVO, winning all available titles. The record in the GT World Challenge America, GT America, and GT4 America is truly out of this world! I’m very sorry for BMW Italia Ceccato Racing that, despite an outstanding season, they just missed out on further titles. The final race was a bitter one. Nevertheless, the team and drivers once again proved what fantastic ambassadors they are for our brand in Italy.”\n\nItalian GT Championship (25.-26.10.): BMW Italia Ceccato Racing narrowly misses title hat-trick.\n\nBMW Italia Ceccato Racing and BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) narrowly missed out on their third consecutive title in the Italian GT Championship Sprint. Despite a victory and a third-place finish at the season finale at Monza (ITA), Klingmann and his works driver teammate Jesse Krohn (FIN) had to settle for second place overall. Driving the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, the duo claimed three wins and three additional podiums in eight races. After a dramatic finale, they fell just three points short of the championship lead. Klingmann and the team had won the Sprint title in the previous two seasons.\n\n“You can’t win the title every year, but I’m very proud of what we achieved as a team because we truly made the most of our opportunities,” said Klingmann. “With our victory in Saturday’s race, we were back in the title fight, but unfortunately, third place on Sunday wasn’t quite enough. I think we deserved it too, but this time Lamborghini had the upper hand. Congratulations to the crew of car #63. We’ll be back to fight again next year.” Krohn added: “Even though the end of the season feels bittersweet, I really enjoyed racing in Italy again. I think we gave everything we could in the title fight. Unfortunately, it just wasn’t enough. My overall season has been extremely positive – I’ve taken wins and podiums everywhere I raced, and above all, I won the 24h Nürburgring. I’m very happy with this year.”\n\nThe title race in the Pro-Am category also remained thrilling until the final event. William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) entered the last race as championship leaders but were forced to retire after an unavoidable collision with their #2 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, dropping to third in the final standings.\n\nThe Indianapolis 8 Hour just over a week ago was not only the season finale of the Intercontinental GT Challenge – where Team WRT triumphed and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) secured the drivers’ title – it also marked the conclusion of the GT World Challenge America powered by AWS. BMW M Motorsport teams continued their incredible run of success there with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The title in the Pro category went to BMW M works driver Connor De Phillippi and his Random Vandals Racing teammate Kenton Koch (both USA). “I’m really proud to be part of this team,” said Koch. “Working with Connor all season has been amazing. We came in with things to learn, but we’ve shown incredible performances throughout the year. I’m proud of everyone and excited for what’s to come.” De Phillippi added: “It’s been an amazing effort from the entire team. I’m so proud of this group. This championship is my first with BMW, and that makes it even more meaningful. Hopefully it’s just the start of many more together.”\n\nIn the Pro-Am category, BMW M works driver Robby Foley and his young Turner Motorsport teammate Justin Rothberg (both USA) celebrated another title win, just like last year. “Justin has made incredible progress this season, he’s on a great trajectory,” said Foley. “Our second year working together has been awesome; we were faster, more consistent, and racked up more wins. Huge thanks to Turner Motorsport, Laticrete, all our partners, and every member of this incredible team.” Rothberg added: “The stars really aligned for us. Indy came through again. Robby and I are champions once more, and it feels fantastic.”\n\nThe celebrations among the BMW M Motorsport teams knew no bounds in both GT4 America and GT America. At the GT4 America Indianapolis (USA) season finale, all three class titles went to crews running the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. In the Silver class, Kenton Koch and Kevin Boehm (both USA) from Random Vandals Racing took the championship crown. Hats off to the whole Random Vandals Racing team this year. They've given us a rocketship every single race, I think we’ve consistently been one of the fastest BMWs this whole season,” said Boehm. “I think it just goes into the preparation that they do behind the scenes. What a day!” Koch pulled off the remarkable feat of winning championships with both BMW M Motorsport GT cars. Random Vandals Racing also dominated thePro-Am category, where Josh Green and Sam Craven (both USA) secured the title in the #94 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. “It’s been an amazing season for Josh and me,” said Craven. “It was our first time in SRO, and Random Vandals Racing did an incredible job. The whole team was just awesome, awesome, awesome!”\n\nIn the Am class, there was also no getting past the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. James Clay and Charlie Postins (both USA) from the BimmerWorld Racing team celebrated the championship victory. “I totally wanted it,” said Clay. “But I was reminded of patience that I rarely show, but I showed it today. That’s what you have to do to win the championship. It was a great battle. Thank you guys for all the memories made over the last four seasons.”\n\nIn GT America, Justin Rothberg completed his double title success with Turner Motorsport in the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, securing both championships for himself and the team. This brought team principal Will Turner’s squad their 11th and 12th titles in 28 years of racing – exclusively with BMW M Motorsport cars. “Coming into this race, I was hopeful that we’d win another championship, but walking away with two is surreal,” said Turner. “I knew the team could do it, and things just went our way. I’m super excited and ready to shoot for it again next year. Every championship that we’ve had over the years has been a little bit different, and they’re all special in different ways. Some are harder than others, and this one was certainly difficult, but the effort paid off.”"}

With the publication of its Environmental Impact Statement 2024, all BMW Group operations in Parsdorf are now part of the European environmental register, EMAS. In addition to the BMW Group Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) and test-parts logistics, the pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf has been included in the environmental impact statement and EMAS registration for the first time. EMAS stands for the “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme”, which claims to be the most stringent environmental management system in the world. “We are very pleased with the EMAS registration of all our operations in Parsdorf, which underlines that our processes operate at a very high level – both economically and environmentally,” says Hansjörg Schilp, director of the CMCC and pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf. “The entire team has done an outstanding job.”\n\nEMAS: Strict requirements and high environmental standards\n\nTo be listed in the EMAS Register, companies must fulfil strict requirements and adhere to rigorous environmental standards. EMAS is a globally recognised framework that enables organisations to manage and continuously improve their environmental impact. A key element of the EMAS environmental management system is the international environmental management standard ISO 14001. EMAS also focuses on measurable improvements, transparency and legal certainty. Auditing aims to support companies in continuously improving their environmental performance – for example, by using energy and material more efficiently and reducing emissions, wastewater and waste from their sites. Beyond these direct environmental impacts, EMAS also addresses and evaluates indirect aspects, including the sustainability of products, procurement and supply chains, contractor practices and the environmental impact of employees commuting to work. (Source: \n\nEfficient operations and concepts for the circular economy\n\nThe validated environmental impact statement and the resulting inclusion in the EMAS Register by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) for Munich and Upper Bavaria underscore the rigorous environmental standards upheld by the BMW Group in Parsdorf. Battery cell production at the CMCC, one of the three Parsdorf facilities, is powered entirely by electricity from 100% renewable energy sources. Hot water for process ventilation is generated using waste heat recovered from various primary processes, and all three Parsdorf facilities utilise heat pumps in their operations. “On our pilot lines for battery cells and high-voltage batteries, we are focusing on reducing the use of critical raw materials and energy, avoiding solvents and developing innovative circular economy approaches,” explains Schilp. Raw materials represent a significant cost factor for battery cells and high-voltage batteries. Efficient and responsible use of these resources is therefore necessary and also makes economic sense. The BMW Group is gaining valuable insights in this area in Parsdorf. Residual materials from the production process are collected and, wherever technically feasible, reintegrated into the value-creation cycle at the BMW Group’s Competence Centres through direct recycling. This innovative procedure enables residual materials from battery cell production, as well as whole battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled into their components.\n\nTransparent reporting: Environmental impact statement now online\n\nThe environmental impact statement for the BMW Group’s Parsdorf operations (CMCC, pilot plant for high-voltage batteries and test-parts logistics) has been independently reviewed by TÜV SÜD Umweltgutachter GmbH and is now available online at: \n\nHow the cell is created: Production steps for sample manufacturing at the CMCC\n\nCell manufacturing at the CMCC in Parsdorf begins with electrode production: Here, the base material, comprising, for example, graphite for the anode and nickel oxides for the cathode, with binders and solvents, is metered and mixed in a precisely measured ratio. This creates the so-called “slurry” – which means wafer-thin metal foils are coated and then compressed after drying. In technical jargon, this is referred to as “calendering”. The highest level of precision is required: The foil is just a few micrometres thick – in other words, thinner than the threads of a spider web – while the coating is in the micrometre range. During cell assembly, the coated foils, referred to in the jargon as calendered electrodes, are coiled into so-called “jelly rolls” using the separator and inserted into the cell housing. The cells are filled with electrolyte, then charged for the first time and finally checked for functionality and quality.\n\nParsdorf pioneers: How the BMW Group builds Gen6 high-voltage batteries\n\nParsdorf is also home to the BMW Group’s largest pilot plant for Gen6 high-voltage batteries, where production processes are developed and tested before large-scale production begins at the series plants in Debrecen (Hungary), Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). More than 350 employees have been building initial high-voltage battery prototypes here since 2023. In the meantime, these batteries have also been delivered to the vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where they were installed in test vehicles for the Neue Klasse. For series production, the BMW Group sources battery cells for its high-voltage batteries from leading cell manufacturers, who produce the cells to the company's specifications. The highest technical standards apply. Upon receipt of goods, additional measurements – such as voltage checks – are carried out. Next comes cell clustering, where the battery cells are connected to coolers. This step ensures optimal insulation and cooling of the cells. The cell clusters and cell contact system are then laser-cleaned and welded with pinpoint precision. The in-line inspection continuously monitors each weld seam in real time. An innovative foaming process follows, ensuring that all elements are protected as a mechanical unit. The foam thus guarantees the safety, stability and durability of the high-voltage battery. The housing is then closed, sealed and riveted. In the final assembly step, the Energy Master – the central control unit – is installed onto the high-voltage battery. A permanently elastic sealing adhesive is applied to ensure a reliable seal. Finally, each high-voltage battery undergoes a 100% end-of-line inspection to ensure quality, safety and function."}

The BMW Group is using its presence at the \"Fleet Europe Days\" on 22 and 23 October in Luxembourg to show fleet operators ways to decarbonise their fleets. In addition to fully electrified vehicles, the focus will be on fuels based on renewable raw materials, so-called Carbon Neutral Fuels (CNF).\n\nTheir advantage: the potential to save CO2. With more than 250 million existing vehicles in Europe, their CO2 footprint can be improved if the proportion of renewable fuels is increased. A new technical solution used by the BMW Group is proof that all BMW diesels in a fleet are fuelled exclusively with HVO100. Refuelling data from the vehicle is compared with data from the fleet operator's payment system. This means that the fuel used by the vehicle can be traced seamlessly. An important step towards a \"CNF only-fleet\" for fleet customers. Dr. Martin Kaufmann, Head of Powertrain Development at the BMW Group: \"Our goal is always to have more environmentally friendly and efficient vehicles on the road. With the diesel replacement fuel HVO100, we have an opportunity to reduce the CO2 footprint of vehicle fleets. Especially in the area of fuels that are not based on fossil fuels, we see a potential that we are ready to realise.”\n\nBernhard Kuhnt, Head of Sales Region Europe, BMW Group: \"Fleet customers are extremely important for sales in Europe and at the same time diesel remains a very good powertrain technology for many fleets.\n\nInitial contractual agreements with the operators of large BMW diesel fleets in Germany and Italy are imminent. These test fleets, together with the internal BMW Group fleet that has already been launched, will provide important data and findings for the further improvement of the technical solution. HVO100 used in the first fuelling of all diesel produced in Germany\n\nSince January 2025, all diesel models produced in Germany are being fuelled with HVO100 before delivery to dealers. This step underlines BMW's commitment to making decarbonisation possible and achievable today. The abbreviation HVO stands for 'Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil' and the suffix '100' indicates that it is filled with 100 per cent pure fuel.\n\n\"Neste MY Renewable Diesel™\" HVO100 is used at the BMW Group plants in Munich, Dingolfing, Regensburg and Leipzig.\n\nThe fuel from Finnish manufacturer Neste enables a CO2e reduction of up to 90 per cent (\"well to wheel\") compared to fossil diesel. The initial filling at the plants before delivery to the BMW Group dealer organisation is five to eight litres, depending on the model. For the BMW Group, technological openness is a top priority. \"Options instead of bans\" is its motto. The company continues to invest in a broad portfolio - from battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cells to highly efficient combustion engines that can run on renewable fuels.\n\nThe BMW Group has long approved its vehicles for a variety of regenerative fuels: HVO according to EN15940 as well as B10 and eFuels according to EN590 for diesel engines. In addition, E20/25 and eFuels according to EN228 for petrol engines.

Mission title defense accomplished: Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) is once again the World Champion in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) for 2025! With third place in the second main race of the dramatic season finale in Jerez de la Frontera (ESP), ‘El Turco’ secured the crown. This marks his second consecutive World Championship title as a BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory rider with the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team – and the third WorldSBK title of his career (2021, 2024, 2025).\n\nAfter his outstanding championship win in 2024, Razgatlioglu entered the 2025 season as the clear favourite. However, following a winter testing phase during which the BMW M 1000 RR had to be adapted at short notice due to regulation changes, the season started off more challenging than expected. Despite scoring a hat-trick at the second round in Portimão (POR), there were also setbacks, and Razgatlioglu found himself in the role of the chaser behind Ducati rider Nicolò Bulega (ITA).\n\nBut by mid-season in June, ‘El Turco’, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team turned the tide. In Misano (ITA), Donington Park (GBR), the new Balaton Park Circuit (HUN), and Magny-Cours (FRA), he won every race – achieving four consecutive hat-tricks and taking the championship lead. He then celebrated his first-ever victory at MotorLand Aragón (ESP), equaling his own record from 2024 of 13 consecutive wins. After further victories and podium finishes, he ultimately secured the 2025 title with 616 points – 13 points ahead of Bulega.\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) wrapped up his final weekend as a WorldSBK rider with more strong Top 10 finishes. After five years with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (2021–2025), he will remain part of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family. Already on Tuesday in Jerez de la Frontera, he will be back on the BMW M 1000 RR, working with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team to prepare for the 2026 WorldSBK season.\n\nReactions after the season finale.\n\nMarkus Flasch, CEO of BMW Motorrad: “Congratulations to Toprak and the entire team! This season, everyone has shown what true champions are made of. The first races weren’t easy, but for everyone – especially for Toprak – the attitude was clear: stand up, straighten your crown, and keep going. And what a way they kept going! The winning streak that began in Misano was simply breathtaking. Even on the nerve-racking final Sunday here in Jerez, after the unfortunate retirement in the Superpole Race through no fault of his own, everyone stayed completely focused and prepared everything perfectly so that Toprak could seal the deal in race two. The reward is Toprak’s well-deserved second World Championship title on our BMW M 1000 RR. We are incredibly proud of him and of everyone in the team, in Munich and Berlin, whose hard work made this achievement possible.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am very happy and smiling. To get the title was very important for me. This was my last year with BMW and in the Superbike Paddock. It is a great gift to BMW before I leave for MotoGP. In the end we are World Champions. At the beginning of the season, we were not so strong but we improved with every race. Thanks to the entire team and BMW for all this hard work. It is not me being the World Champion, it is us. Looking back onto this final weekend: Everything went very well yesterday especially and today I came to the track more relaxed. I just needed to finish the Superpole Race within the top seven but we crashed in turn five. I know this is racing and everybody wants to pass. It is that he (Nicolò Bulega) just hit me and I crashed. After that I just stayed calm and focused on race two because I needed to do a good job there. I just focused on achieving the best possible position. I started the race not pushing too hard but I worked my way to the front step by step and in the end, we were on the podium. To be World Champion again is a great feeling and I want to thank everyone who was part of this journey.”\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I am very happy – and speechless. It is such a great day. I think that after the Superpole Race, we all aged by ten years. The job the team did was amazing. The bike was pretty damaged and to work under that pressure to get it ready for race two was incredible. Everybody stayed calm, and I think this was in the end the key for us to win the title. The second title in a row – we are happy for Toprak, for the team, for BMW Motorrad. Toprak wrote history for BMW. It was wild ride together and we are sad that it’s over but we will cheer for him next year. And we are also so thankful for everything that Mickey has done for us. We had difficult years, also with injuries but he was always loyal to us. And he has played an important part in winning these two title in both years. We are really looking forward to continue working with him. What we are going to do, we will announce soon. But for now – we are going to have a big party tonight, and from tomorrow on we fully focus on the 2026 WorldSBK season with Danilo Petrucci and Miguel Oliveira.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I can‘t describe how I feel because it was an incredible day. A few hours with a lot of emotions, ups and downs, everything happened. But at the end for sure to see Toprak back on the podium, celebrating the second world championship for us, for BMW, makes me very proud and the whole project, the whole team, everybody involved. So it’s a fantastic day to complete a fantastic. At the end the key for any success in sport is always focus and teamwork. We listened to the riders, we looked into our package and tried to be focused to learn from the situation when we were not fast enough to beat our competitors. And with the focus of the riders, of the crew and all our technicians in Munich, we managed to turn the page. Thank you to Toprak, who is an incredible person on and off the track, thank you to Mickey, who did so much for us since he joined in 2021, and thank you to the entire team! A very personal thank-you also goes to my wife Katharina and my kids, who are always a source of support for me.”\n\nShaun Muir, Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “My feelings are really tough to put into words. We woke up feeling super, super positive, but as we always know anything can happen in racing and it actually did in the sprint race. I’ve just got to put my hands together and praise the good work the guys did. The entire team stayed focused. In the end Toprak is a three-times World Champion, and two times with BMW. I am absolutely over the moon, proud as you can be, of everyone involved and the lot of hard work everybody did.\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a nice weekend. I have for sure some mixed feelings about my races, especially race two I didn’t enjoy as much as I wish I did. But you know it’s racing and I think after today we have a lot of things to be happy about with the team. It has been a strange season. The start of the season was a bit weird with the last minute changes in regulations and stuff like that. Especially my side, I struggled quite a lot with the bike honestly. Also at one point, mentally it was difficult and I just could not find any progress. That has been tough. But we always kept working, the team always kept working and I think towards the end of the year I did the Suzuka 8 Hours, got my confidence back and then when I came back I had the speed again and I felt more confident with the bike.

Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) was crowned Drivers’ Champion of the Intercontinental GT Challenge at the season finale. The South African took victory in a chaotic Indianapolis 8 Hour (USA) alongside Charles Weerts (BEL) and Valentino Rossi (ITA) in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO fielded by Team WRT. Their teammates Raffaele Marciello (ITA), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) completed the double podium by finishing third in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. With that, BMW clinched its first-ever Manufacturers’ Championship title in the IGTC. The “Battle on the Bricks” was initially halted for a long time due to a thunderstorm with heavy rain and eventually finished behind the safety car.\n\nFrom the start of the weekend, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO showed strong pace on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. All five BMW cars made it into the Pole Shootout. Philipp Eng (AUT) set the fastest time there in the #51 Random Vandals Racing entry – but the team was stripped of pole position after the car was found to be slightly under the minimum weight. This promoted the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Team WRT to start from second place, directly ahead of its sister car, the #46.\n\nIn the race, the strong performance from qualifying continued as all BMW M4 GT3 EVOs impressed from the start. After three and a half hours, the four Pro entries occupied positions two through five when the title contenders took over driving duties for the first time: Marciello in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in second place, directly ahead of van der Linde in third. With two spectacular overtakes, the WRT duo soon took over the lead and established a 1–2 formation – before a thunderstorm moved over the circuit and brought out a red flag for more than two hours.\n\nAround 90 minutes before the end of the clock, the Indianapolis 8 Hour resumed behind the safety car in heavy rain. Pit stops shuffled the order, putting van der Linde in the lead in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, while the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO with Marciello at the wheel lost two positions due to a later stop. The race was briefly restarted but soon ended again behind the safety car – with the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO leading the field to the finish. Thus, Team WRT celebrated its third consecutive victory at the Indianapolis 8 Hour, following wins in 2023 and 2024.\n\nWith its fourth win in five races this season, BMW also claimed the IGTC Manufacturers’ Championship for the first time, while van der Linde secured the Drivers’ Title. Earlier in the season, BMW M Motorsport and van der Linde had already triumphed at the Bathurst 12 Hour, the Nürburgring 24 Hours, and the Suzuka 1000KM. Just the previous Sunday, the South African and Weerts had also won the overall title in the GT World Challenge Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, bad luck struck the #51 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Eng, Bill Auberlen, and Varun Choksey (both USA). After a brilliant opening stint from tenth on the grid, the Random Vandals Racing car even led the race at one stage. However, a technical issue with the engine cost the team significant time in the pits, and they eventually retired after the red flag. Their teammates Connor De Phillippi, Conor Daly, and Kenton Koch (all USA) delivered a strong performance in the #99 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, finishing fourth overall. That result also secured De Phillippi and Koch the Drivers’ Title in the GT World Challenge America.\n\nTurner Motorsport celebrated third place in the Pro-Am category with the #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO driven by BMW M works driver Robby Foley alongside Patrick Gallagher and Justin Rothberg (USA). With that result, Foley and Rothberg also claimed the overall Pro-Am Championship title.\n\nQuotes after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What an impressive season in the Intercontinental GT Challenge! Four wins out of five races underline the remarkable consistency of our teams and drivers. Congratulations to Team WRT for their third consecutive victory at the Indianapolis 8 Hour. I am absolutely delighted that we were able to secure the Manufacturers’ title in the series for the first time. Congratulations also to Kelvin van der Linde on the Drivers’ Championship – even though Raffaele Marciello would have deserved it just as much. My compliments also go to Turner Motorsport and Robby Foley for their Pro-Am title, as well as to Random Vandals Racing, Connor De Phillippi, and Kenton Koch for their GTWC America crown. Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to all the teams who contributed to these outstanding achievements.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, WRT): “It’s a great way to finish the Intercontinental GT Championship with a win in Indianapolis – our third in a row. Unfortunately, we made a mistake with the #777 by not calling them in at the right time. I feel very sorry for Lello, but that’s racing. Still, I’m very happy that we were able to bring this trophy home to BMW, and of course I’m very happy for Kelvin. The team did a fantastic job – having two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs on the podium is a great result. Thanks to the SRO for this championship; they did an excellent job this year.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Drivers’ Champion): “The #777 deserved the win – they were stronger the whole weekend. But sometimes you just have bad luck in racing. Unfortunately, the weather decided the race today. Apart from that, four wins in five races make this an extraordinary year for BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT. We need to enjoy and celebrate that – it doesn’t happen every year. I’m very proud to have contributed a small piece of history in my first year with BMW M Motorsport.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Winner): “I’m obviously very happy for BMW M Motorsport to secure the championship in Indianapolis. It was a bizarre race with the thunderstorm and the rain, which unfortunately prevented us from really racing for most of the event. The #777 was very strong the whole weekend and was ahead of us at the time of the red flag – they definitely deserved the win today. But the most important thing is that BMW won.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Winner): “I’m really happy – it was a great weekend. These kinds of races are the ones I really enjoy, and I also learn a lot from them. I think I did a good job in the first two hours. The #777 had great pace but was very unlucky. Overall, I’m very happy with the weekend and my performance because I really enjoyed it.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 3rd place): “We had a lot of fun together as teammates. There’s just a great atmosphere within BMW. The race itself hurts a bit. The main goal was to secure the championship for BMW – and we did that, which makes me very happy. We won many races this season, and I’m very happy for Kelvin; he deserves it. But of course it hurts, and we’ll try again next year.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#51 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Random Vandals Racing, DNF): “It was great to race with Random Vandals Racing. The team is fantastic, and the car was perfectly prepared. We were competitive from the very start of the weekend. The Superpole went perfectly – the car was great, and I managed a strong lap. The first stint was a lot of fun; fighting my way through the field from tenth after the penalty was great. Unfortunately, we had to retire because we lost too many laps due to a technical issue. But for me, it was a great experience racing with this team, and I’d love to come back.”\n\nRobby Foley (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 3rd place Pro-Am): “It was a crazy race with the weather, but we had the clear goal of winning the title. Our competitors dropped out early, so we had to be smart, sensible, and mistake-free – and in the end, we came home third. It was a great season with Justin; he’s improved so much in just one year. To be back-to-back Pro-Am Champions is something very special. A huge thank you to Turner Motorsport and BMW M Motorsport for all the support.”\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#99 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Random Vandals Racing, 4th place): “I’m very happy about the GT World Challenge America title. It’s my first championship since joining BMW M Motorsport. Kenton and the team did a fantastic job. It would have been nice to fight for the win here, but we had to secure our championship points. Still, it was a good day, a great year, and I’m already looking forward to 2026.”"}

On the occasion of this new edition of Paris Photo at the Grand Palais, BMW France unveils the exhibition “Crossing the Missing Fragment”, by artist Raphaëlle Peria and curator Fanny Robin, the duo laureates of the BMW ART MAKERS mentoring programme.\n\nA partnership backed by a shared vision for the future of culture.For more than 50 years, BMW has affirmed its lasting commitment to culture, convinced that artists are trailblazers who can anticipate and reveal the major issues of their era. Supporting creation means supporting those who shape tomorrow’s perspectives.\n\nFor 23 years, this role has been notably expressed through this partnership with Paris Photo. By supporting the international photographic and artistic scene, BMW provides decisive visibility to emerging talents. Many artists supported by the programme have since achieved major recognition, confirming the strength and relevance of this commitment.\n\nThis ongoing dialogue between artistic innovation, society, and business reflects a shared desire: to embed culture for the long term and make it accessible to all, both today and for future generations.\n\n“Together, we make culture shine today and for future generations, by valuing its longevity in a world where everything speeds up,” says Vincent Salimon, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW Group France.\n\n“Crossing the Missing Fragment” reinvented for Paris Photo.“Trees are living beings that carry our memory; they are the guardians of our secrets.” Raphaëlle Peria.\n\nThe second part of the exhibition, created by the duo laureates of the BMW ART MAKERS programme, is presented in November under the Grand Palais’s dome in Paris. First unveiled this summer at the 56th edition of the Rencontres d’Arles, at the Cloître Saint-Trophime, the exhibition has been reinvented for Paris Photo and enriched with approximately ten new works. For the occasion, the set design has been entirely rethought and specially conceived to enhance this new chapter.\n\nFanny Robin, the curator, thus presents the project as follows: “Embarking on the journey at the heart of the exhibition Crossing the Missing Fragment is to retrace the thread of water and time. Through this project, Raphaëlle Peria offers us an intimate archaeology of the image, where personal memory engages in dialogue with the universal.\n\nAfter its initial presentation at the Rencontres d’Arles, this second part of the exhibition conceived for Paris Photo is unveiled as an even more immersive traverse of the landscape. With a renewed scenography designed as a space of resonance that interacts transparently with the Grand Palais’s glass roof, the exhibition takes on a decidedly different form. A series of new works, created specifically for the occasion, subtly resonates with the venue’s architecture .\n\nAt the pinnacle of this installation, a copper wallpaper with ardent reflections envelops the space like a fresco-palimpsest, blurring the lines between archival images and representations of a present environment. Through this revised approach, new sensitive strata unfold within the space, bearing witness to the uniqueness of Raphaëlle Peria’s gaze and singular gesture.\n\nThe project begins with the discovery of an exhumed photo album, a relic from a childhood journey aboard a barge, initiating this new creation. Family archives, long buried, revive fragmentary memories and become the foundation of an exploration where memories confront the evolution of the landscape. Thirty years later, Raphaëlle Peria returns to the places once crossed. She finds a nature in peril: the plane trees along the Canal du Midi, rotting from within due to the colored canker, now embody a slow disappearance. Confronted with this silent erosion, the artist tirelessly scratches the surface of images, revealing through subtraction the imprint of passing time. With complete transparency, she translates the fragility of life through the very material of photography.”\n\nThe BMW ART MAKERS programme brings together and supports an emerging visual artist and a curator in the creation of a collaborative artistic project.\n\nThe laureate duo, composed of an artist and a curator, receives a grant of 33,000 euros which covers the scholarship as well as the research and production budget for the works. The project is presented each year at the Rencontres d'Arles and then at Paris Photo, of which BMW is an official partner.\n\nPractical informationExhibition “Crossing the Missing Fragment”by Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny RobinParis Photo - Stand C01 Grand Palaisfrom November 13 to 16, 2025\n\nBiographies of the BMW ART MAKERS 2025 Laureates.\n\nRaphaëlle Peria, Artist Graduated in 2014 from the École Européenne Supérieure d’Art de Bretagne.

The 2025 BMW Ladies Championship got off to a perfect start at its new venue, Pine Beach Golf Links near Gwangju in southwest South Korea. During the first round, Lucy Li (USA) sunk a hole-in-one on the 13th hole (par 3). For her spectacular shot from a distance of 155 yards with a 7-iron, the American golfer was rewarded with an all-electric BMW i7 eDrive50. The 23-year-old, currently ranked 97th in the world, has been playing on the LPGA Tour since 2023 but has yet to secure a tournament victory. With today’s hole-in-one, Li joins the illustrious group of players who have earned themselves sheer driving pleasure at BMW professional tournaments around the globe.\n\nThe hole-in-one helped Li achieve an opening round of 68 strokes (4 under par), placing her in a tie for 22nd. Leading the 78-player field at their home event are two South Korean golfers: Sei Young Kim (62, -10) is in first place, followed by Hyo Joo Kim (63, -9). Since there is no cut at the BMW Ladies Championship, all players still have three rounds to follow in Li’s footsteps and claim one of the two remaining Hole-in-One Awards at the only LPGA Tour stop in South Korea. Tournament organiser BMW Korea will reward the first hole-in-one on the 8th hole with a MINI John Cooper Works Countryman ALL4, while the all-electric premium SAV BMW iX awaits a new owner on the 15th hole.\n\nLi is the fourth player to earn a Hole-in-One Award in the history of the BMW Ladies Championship. The first to do so was Kristen Gillman during the inaugural event in 2019. At LPGA International Busan, the 13 (par 3) also proved to be her lucky number. From a distance of 179 yards, Gillman holed out with a 4-hybrid, marking the first ace of her professional career and winning a BMW 740Li XDrive.\n\nThree years later, something unparalleled happened at the Oak Valley Country Club. The BMW Group has been involved in international professional golf since 1989, but what occurred at the 2022 BMW Ladies Championship had never been seen before when two Hole-in-One Awards were won on the same day. During round three of the BMW Ladies Championship, South Korean Na Yeon Choi was rewarded for her dream shot on the 12th hole with a BMW X7 xDrive40i. A short while later, cheers rang round the course again, as Thailand’s Ariya Jutanugarn aced the 17th to win a BMW 740i.\n\nSince that ‘Super-Saturday’ in October 2022, no other BMW professional tournament around the world has seen such a spectacular double.

This year and next, the BMW Ladies Championship will be held at Pine Beach Golf Links near Gwangju in the southwest of the country. The tournament will feature a spectacular layout, combining the Pine Course on the front nine and the Beach Course on the back nine, with numerous holes stretching along the coastline.\n\nGolf fans in South Korea can look forward not only to the unique BMW tournament experience, for which the premium automaker is renowned at its golf events worldwide, but also to an impressive lineup of stars. The compact field of 78 players will compete across all four days, as there is no cut at this event. This ensures a high-quality field: 68 world-class golfers, including defending champion Hannah Green (AUS), will tee off, along with eight high-profile tournament invitees and two Korean amateur players. Among the competitors are former champions Minjee Lee (AUS, 2023), ranked fourth in the world and Jin Young Ko (KOR, 2021).

The all-electric premium sedan BMW i7 is the Hole-in-One Award at hole 13, while the all-electric premium SAV BMW iX awaits a new owner at hole 15.\n\nIn the history of the BMW Ladies Championship, three players have earned the hole-in-one award. Kristen Gillman was the first, achieving her first professional ace at the inaugural event in 2019, winning a BMW 740Li xDrive. At the 2022 BMW Ladies Championship, fans celebrated two Hole-in-One Awards in a single day: South Korea’s Na Yeon Choi won a BMW X7 xDrive40i, while Thailand’s Ariya Jutanugarn claimed a BMW 740i.\n\nThe BMW Ladies Championship made its debut in 2019 at LPGA International Busan in the southeast of the country, where the second edition was also held two years later.

The Japan Mobility Show 2025 becomes the stage for the latest milestone in the long-standing collaboration between MINI and British designer Paul Smith. It will be unveiled as part of the BMW Group Keynote on 29 October 2025 at 09:55 (JST) at the BMW Group stand, based in the West Exhibition Hall of the show.\n\nMINI and Paul Smith: A creative success story.\n\nThe MINI Paul Smith Edition is a new chapter in the success story of the two British brands. The long-lasting relationship began in 1998, when the designer wrapped a Classic Mini Cooper in his trademark visual design. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Classic Mini in 1999, the designer lent his characteristic Paul Smith \"Signature Stripe\" to a one-off model. After two further one-offs - the MINI Strip in 2021 and the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith in 2022 - Paul Smith's design language returns to MINI.\n\nMINI model portfolio.\n\nAs part of the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show, MINI is presenting the diverse range of its current product portfolio. The MINI Cooper family is represented by showcasing the MINI Cooper SE, which combines heritage, technology and driving pleasure. Whilst providing a fully electric go-kart feeling via the 218 hp electric powertrain. Also present will be the MINI Cooper 5-door S, which combines compact dimensions and agility whilst showcasing increased practicality when compared to its 3-door siblings. A MINI Cooper Convertible will also be on show, which presents open-air driving in the spirit of its ‘Always Open’ philosophy: agile, spontaneous and full of driving pleasure.Launched earlier this year, the MINI John Cooper Works Aceman outlines its sporty all-electric useable performance from the John Cooper Works sub-brand. The latest model in the MINI family presents itself as a versatile companion and not only demonstrates MINIs typical \"Clever Use of Space\" - but also brings a powerful driving experience to the road as a performance-enhanced version thanks to 258 hp produced from the 54.2 kWh electric battery. Finally, the MINI Countryman S ALL 4 will also be present on the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show: as the largest of the MINI family, the car offers generous space and fits in perfectly for those looking for longer adventures and spontaneous exploring.\n\nThe Japan Mobility Show is regarded as one of the most important international platforms for pioneering mobility concepts. From October 29 to November 9, over 130 exhibitors will be presenting their innovations to visitors and press at the Tokyo Big Sight exhibition centre - making the Japanese capital the centre for visions of tomorrow's mobility.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption combined: 14.7 - 14.1 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 387 - 402).

This marks the first time a team with the BMW M4 GT4 has finished a Nürburgring season on top. I am very proud of this achievement, as it not only highlights the outstanding performance of the team and drivers but also underlines the strong and highly competitive nature of the GT4 classes in the NLS. Our customer racing car regularly plays a leading role in the 'Green Hell' and delivers spectacular racing. I also want to congratulate all other winners and champions who compete with our cars in the NLS. Beyond that, our ambassadors around the world have celebrated further successes – whether in the GT4 European Series in Spain, the IMSA series in the USA, the Italian GT, or in Hungary at the GT Cup Series. Our customers are giving us plenty of reasons to celebrate as the season comes to a close, and I am very happy about that.\"\n\nNLS 9 & 10 (27.9./11.10.): FK Performance Motorsport celebrates overall title with the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nThe new Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) champions are FK Performance Motorsport, Nick Wüstenhagen (GER), and Ranko Mijatovic (SUI). With an incredible streak of nine class victories in ten races, they secured the overall title in the 2025 Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) with the #187 BMW M4 GT4. Alongside their rotating co-drivers, Wüstenhagen and Mijatovic dominated the SP8T class. This marks not only FK Performance Motorsport’s first NLS overall title but also the first for the BMW M4 GT4. \"We’ve been competing in the NLS as FK Performance since 2013, and it makes us very proud to now be crowned champions. This was definitely not an unlucky 13th year for us; it’s one of our greatest achievements,\" said team principal Martin Kaemena.\n\nThe Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels, which had won the championship for the past seven years, finished the 2025 season in fifth place overall with drivers Philipp Leisen, Philipp Stahlschmidt, and Daniel Zils (all GER) in the #500 BMW 330i.

In Sunday’s season finale, Besler and Piana secured third place in the #12 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. With one victory at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) and six podium finishes in 12 races, they ended the season in a strong third place in the Silver Class. Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport also claimed second place in the team standings for the category. “It was a good weekend. Both drivers had strong qualifying sessions, and we ran two clean races. Gabriele and the entire team did a fantastic job throughout the season. I’m very happy with our performance this year. Six podiums in 12 races show how competitive we were. I’m already looking forward to next season,” said Besler.\n\nThe season finale was less fortunate for Jean-Mathieu Leandri and Antoni de Barn (both FRA) from CHAZEL Technologie Course. After five wins in the AM category during the first ten races, they arrived in Catalonia with title hopes. However, a collision in Saturday’s race left them without points for the first time this season, and they ultimately finished second in the overall standings.\n\nIMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge (10.-12.10.): Podium finish for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO.\n\nAt the season finale of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge in Road Atlanta (USA), Turner Motorsport secured a podium finish with the #96 BMW M4 GT4 EVO.

Walker impressed with six consecutive wins and nine victories overall during the season. Despite scoring no points in the first two events of the year, he managed to secure second place overall.

On Saturday, they finished seventh overall and fourth in the GT3-Pro class. Their teammates William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) also had reason to celebrate, finishing second and third in the GT3-Pro-Am class with the #2 car.

The spectacular street race on the Guia Circuit in Macau (CHN) is just around the corner, and BMW M Motorsport will compete on 15th/16th November with two high-profile BMW M4 GT3 EVO entries. Raffaele Marciello (SUI) will race for ROWE Racing in a car featuring a newly developed livery. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Team WRT, as in the previous year, will take to the track in a car sporting the special design of BMW M Motorsport Premium Technology Partner Shell.\n\nIn 2024, Marciello celebrated victory in the qualification race during his Macau debut as a BMW M works driver. However, in the rain-affected main race, he retired while battling for the win. Marciello has earned his reputation as a Macau specialist through his triumphs in 2019 and 2023. This year, his BMW M4 GT3 EVO will be fielded by ROWE Racing. The new identity design debuts a revised colour scheme, replacing the previous white, yellow, and grey with white, red, and black.\n\nVan der Linde also competed in 2024 with a special Shell livery – and it brought him luck. In his second Macau appearance, he secured his first podium finish by taking third place in the main race. He now aims to improve on this record during his third outing in Macau, once again teaming up with WRT.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"After the bitter main race last year, we still have unfinished business with the FIA GT World Cup. Our BMW M4 GT3 was very strong on the Guia Circuit in 2024 but missed out on the main race victory due to external circumstances. This year, we aim to claim that win with the EVO version of our GT car. With Raffaele Marciello and Sheldon van der Linde, we have two drivers who have repeatedly proved their class at this street race in recent years. Add to that two experienced teams, and we have created the best possible conditions for the next BMW M Motorsport victory in the Main Race since 2018.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello: \"I’m really excited to return to Macau. It’s one of the best races of the year, and the track is fantastic. This year, we have a new qualifying format with a Superpole, which will be very interesting. Together with ROWE Racing, I’ve had some very strong performances this season, so I’m happy to be back with this great team. Last year, we came close to victory. This time, we’ll give it our all to stand on the top step of the podium.\"\n\nSheldon van der Linde: \"I love this race and definitely want to keep coming back until I win it. That’s one of my big goals. We’ve been strong over the past two years and made it to the podium in 2024. I want to build on that momentum together with Team WRT. We work very well together, and hopefully, we can be serious contenders for the win. This will be my third start in Macau – and as they say, third time’s the charm.\""}

What a spectacular season finale for the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS in Barcelona (ESP)! The three-hour race at the Circuit de Catalunya concluded with a shower of titles and two podium finishes for the BMW M Motorsport teams. Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Charles Weerts (BEL) capped off a fantastic comeback by winning the drivers' title in the overall standings. At the same time, the overall team title went to Team WRT. Vincent Vosse's squad also celebrated winning the team championship in the GOLD Cup. In the SILVER category, Century Motorsport triumphed in the drivers' standings of the Endurance Cup. In the race itself, AlManar Racing by WRT and ROWE Racing secured second and third places on the podium.\n\nAfter a disappointing qualifying session for all BMW M Motorsport teams, the day initially didn’t seem destined for celebration. However, over the course of the three-hour race, all crews made significant progress. The #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO started from 31st position after a penalty, but Weerts, van der Linde, and Ugo de Wilde (BEL) fought their way up to sixth place, earning enough points to crown van der Linde and Weerts as the new overall champions in the combined Sprint and Endurance Cup standings. The duo had also secured the Sprint Cup title just a few weeks earlier. Over the 2025 season, the #32 car achieved three victories and four additional podium finishes, which also secured the overall team title for Team WRT.\n\nAnother title for Team WRT was clinched by Jens Klingmann (GER), Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA), and Ben Tuck (GBR) with an impressive second-place finish in the race. The overall podium for the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of AlManar Racing by WRT also secured the team title in the GOLD Cup. Third place on the podium in Barcelona went to Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) in the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of ROWE Racing.\n\nDespite a challenging race that included an early, unavoidable spin, Jarrod Waberski (RSA), Mex Jansen (NED), and William Moore (GBR) still had reason to celebrate as the trio won the drivers' title in the SILVER category of the Endurance Cup with the #42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Century Motorsport.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"What a season finale in the GT World Challenge Europe! Congratulations to Kelvin van der Linde, Charles Weerts, and Team WRT on winning the overall titles. This triumph highlights the impressive consistency of the team and drivers in both Sprint and Endurance races, which present completely different challenges. To crown this strong season with such a spectacular comeback of 25 positions today is fantastic. My heartfelt congratulations also go to the champions in the GOLD and SILVER Cups. AlManar Racing by WRT and Century Motorsport delivered outstanding performances throughout the season and represented BMW M Motorsport more than worthily in this highly competitive racing series. Looking at the race itself, congratulations to AlManar Racing by WRT and ROWE Racing for their podium finishes after equally impressive comebacks. A big thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to the teams who contributed to this extremely successful GT World Challenge Europe season!\"\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, WRT): \"I’m incredibly happy that we were able to finish the season like this. Winning the overall titles was the big goal after the Sprint Cup titles. It didn’t look like it after qualifying, but huge thanks to the team for the spot-on strategic call in the first stint, which brought us forward. Congratulations to the #777 crew for their podium and the team title in the GOLD Cup. I want to sincerely thank everyone in the team whose hard work made such a successful season possible.\"\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Champion): \"It has been a fantastic season, crowned with the overall championship. Of course, our race pace today wasn’t particularly strong. We need to learn from this during the break to improve for next year. But looking at the entire season, we were probably the most consistent team – and that’s the reward. I’m very proud of the entire Team WRT, Charles, and Ugo. It’s the perfect conclusion to my first GT World Challenge season with BMW M Motorsport. I’m very proud.\"\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Champion): \"It was a very good season. Sprint Cup winners and overall champions – that’s everything we could have wished for at the start of the year. We made almost no mistakes and got the best out of every situation. The only regret is Spa, as it’s the biggest race, and we could have put ourselves in an even better position for the Endurance Cup there. But overall, we can be very proud of the season. A big thank you to BMW M Motorsport for providing us with an incredibly strong car. Thanks also to Team WRT, Kelvin, and Ugo for a great season we shared together.\"\n\nJens Klingmann (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by WRT, 2nd place): \"What an incredible race! At the start of the weekend, we didn’t feel like we had the fastest car, so we focused on long-run performance with the setup. During the race, a brilliant strategic decision in the first stint moved us far forward, and Ben was even able to work his way almost to the front. For me, it got tight at the end due to the late safety car, but I’m super happy with second place and winning the team title in the GOLD Cup. Once again, we’ve shown what can be achieved through perfect teamwork.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 3rd place): \"We had a strong final race. At the start, we had some luck with the safety car and benefitted from a good strategy. I had a very good stint with some overtakes. Without the issue at Paul Ricard and the retirement in Monza, we could have been in the championship fight. Overall, though, we can be satisfied with our season – and we’ll try to come back even stronger next year.\"\n\nJarrod Waberski (#42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Century Motorsport, SILVER Champion Endurance Cup): \"This season was spectacular. From the first race, we were able to score points consistently, won at Monza, and stood on the podium at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Here in Barcelona, after the spin in the first lap, we thought the title might slip away from us, but we stuck together as a team, fought back, and ultimately brought the title home.

Two more victories on the road to the riders’ world championship title and important points for the manufacturers’ battle – Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team once again shone at Estoril. The penultimate round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took place at the Portuguese circuit near Lisbon. Riding his #1 BMW M 1000 RR, Razgatlioglu won both the first main race and the Superpole race, and added a second-place podium finish in race two. He also set new lap records over the weekend. As the leader of the riders’ standings, “El Turco” now heads to the season finale at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) with a 39-point lead over his closest rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati).\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) also showed strong form at Estoril. In Saturday’s first race, he was caught up in a multi-rider incident at the first corner through no fault of his own. He was able to take part in the restart but faced technical issues and finished 15th. In the Superpole race, he secured an important ninth place to improve his grid position for race two, where he finished tenth – once again inside the top ten.\n\nIn the manufacturers’ standings, BMW remains hot on the heels of leaders Ducati, trailing by just three points ahead of the final round. A total of 62 points will still be up for grabs in the last three races of the season at Jerez de la Frontera.\n\nReactions after the Estoril round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another important step towards the title and an almost perfect weekend for us. With two victories and a second place, we can now travel to Jerez with a very solid points advantage. Toprak’s performance was once again outstanding. At the same time, Nicolò Bulega’s performance also deserves recognition. What those two showed in the races, pulling away from the rest of the field, was on another level. We are also very happy with Mickey’s performance; he did a great job with his top-ten results. I think he too is ready for his, for now, last race weekend in WorldSBK. We will now do everything we can – in Berlin, Munich, England, and at the track – to be as well prepared as possible, and we’re looking forward to the season finale.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another fantastic weekend with two wins, pole position, lap records, and a second place. With this tremendous weekend, Toprak extended his lead in the riders’ championship – a maximum success that the entire team can be proud of. Toprak showed his professionalism in every race, and in the second main race he knew that second place was also crucial for the championship, for the big goal. He didn’t take any unnecessary risks to go for the win. Looking ahead to Jerez, we are excited for an intense finale, and we want to express our gratitude to the organisers and the FIM, whose control and regulatory mechanisms ensure fair competition that thrills fans at the track and on TV with two magnificent riders at the front.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I was really happy to win the first race. At the beginning, all was under control but then Nicolò had a bit more grip than me. At the end of the race I was spinning a lot but he was too. In the Superpole race, the start was a bit difficult, I was fighting with Nicolò on the first two laps. But then I just focused on my pace, pushing for a good lap time and trying to not make any mistake. So in the end I won again. Race two was more difficult for me. I was back in fifth, had to overtake but just focused on my job to catch Nicolò. When I was back in second place I was pushing so hard on every lap that the rear tyre dropped, so I was struggling a lot. I had to start to manage my race and I just thought: ‘Okay, this time it is impossible to win, P2 is enough because I need the good points for the championship.’ Now I am looking forward to Jerez. We have some margin in the championship, and everything else we will see there. Nicolò is very strong at Jerez but I will try to do my best again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At the last couple of rounds we had a great feeling with the bike and then we came here and for some reason we struggled quite a lot with the bike in the beginning. We couldn’t get the right feeling and not the right speed on Friday. For Saturday morning, we improved our pace and our package a lot. I was confident for Superpole but unfortunately I lost a lot of time by missing a gear. Especially here you lose a lot of places on the grid and P12 was not fantastic. In race one, I had a good start, but unfortunately someone crashed in turn one and took me out. The guys in the pit box made sure that the spare bike was ready and I was able to do the re-start. After a few good laps I unfortunately had a technical issue. I managed to finish the race and score one point, but it was a very disappointing Saturday. In Sunday’s Superpole race we decided to go with the race tyre as we felt that the qualifying tyre was a big risk. I finished P9 which was not too bad. It was good to move up on the grid, especially for turn one. My start in race two was not great but I had a good pace.

BMW M Motorsport concludes the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) season with mixed emotions. There was great celebration over the victory of the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paul Miller Racing in the GTD PRO class. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Connor De Phillippi (USA) triumphed at Petit Le Mans in Road Atlanta (USA). The victory secured the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup title for Harper and Hesse. BMW M Team RLL delivered a strong farewell race with the BMW M Hybrid V8 but was denied the deserved result due to a puncture on the #24 car shortly before the finish .\n\nPhilipp Eng (AUT), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Kevin Magnussen (DEN) were on course for fourth place after a consistently strong race, but around ten minutes before the finish, Eng reported a right-rear tyre puncture. The subsequent pit stop dropped the crew back to ninth place. In the #25 car, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER), and Robin Frijns (NED) finished eleventh. The trio lost touch with the leaders due to two drive-through penalties. The Petit Le Mans marked the final race for BMW M Team RLL with the BMW M Hybrid V8. After 17 years, 25 victories, and more than 100 podium finishes, the collaboration with BMW M Motorsport comes to an end. Starting in 2026, BMW M Team WRT will take over the racing operations in the GTP class.\n\nIn the GTD PRO class, the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO crew from Paul Miller Racing delivered a dominant weekend. Harper secured pole position in qualifying for the second consecutive time. During the race, the car led for nearly the entire ten hours and crossed the finish line as a well-deserved winner with a comfortable margin. The victory secured the Endurance Cup title for Harper and Hesse in their debut IMSA season. The #1 sister car fell far behind early in the race due to a technical issue and finished in ninth place. Turner Motorsport, competing in the GTD class, achieved eighth place with Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, and Jake Walker (all USA).\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"Congratulations to Paul Miller Racing, Dan Harper, Max Hesse, and Connor De Phillippi on their fantastic victory, which also secured the Endurance Cup title for Dan and Max. It was truly a perfect race. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as we had hoped in the GTP class. For nine hours and 50 minutes, we were on course for second place in the drivers' standings, which would have been a great result. Then, the #24 car suffered the misfortune of a puncture. The #25 car was set back by two drive-through penalties. Unfortunately, the results don’t reflect our performance. The BMW M Hybrid V8 was strong in the race and had the potential for much better results. This was the final race for BMW M Team RLL with us in the GTP class. I want to sincerely thank the team for their dedication and loyalty over so many years and wish them all the best for the future. A big thank you also to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to our customer teams, Paul Miller Racing and Turner Motorsport, for a great season.\"\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 9th place): \"It’s unbelievable that we suffered a puncture just ten minutes before the finish. We were in a good position, had a strong package, and were on course for fourth place in the race. That would have meant second place in the drivers' standings for Dries and me. It’s really disappointing, but life goes on. A big thank you to Dries for being such an incredible teammate this season. I especially want to thank BMW M Team RLL for eight great years together. Our first race at Daytona in 2018 was my debut in a works programme. Since then, we’ve experienced so much, and I’ve made many friends in the team. That makes this farewell emotional for me. Thanks also to BMW M Motorsport for all the hard work throughout the season.\"\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 11th place): \"A tough end to a tough season – that probably sums up our year best. We often had the potential but didn’t manage to put everything together. We’ll take many lessons from this season. We didn’t get everything right, so maybe we didn’t deserve to be at the very top. But 2026 is a new year, and hopefully, we’ll come back stronger.\"\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"What a fantastic weekend! It started great with pole position – my second in a row. The race was a first for Max and me, and it was great to have Connor with his Petit Le Mans experience on board. All three of us did a flawless job. The car doesn’t have a scratch, which is incredibly important in a long-distance race on such a narrow track with much faster prototypes. The race was a lot of fun, and ending the season with this victory and the Endurance Cup title is amazing. Unfortunately, we had some issues in other races this season, which cost us the chance to win the overall championship.\"\n\nMax Hesse (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"I’m pretty speechless and exhausted after this tough race. Everyone said beforehand that Petit Le Mans is one of the hardest races to win. The fact that we managed to do it on our first attempt is incredible. Winning the Endurance Cup title on top of that crowns this day. Huge thanks to Paul Miller Racing for the perfect job and to BMW M Motorsport for the great car.\"\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"For me, it was something new and special to race across two cars. Unfortunately, we had technical issues with the #1 car relatively early, so my focus shifted to the #48. The car felt fantastic and was very fast throughout the race. The team also did a flawless job. That’s how you win endurance races.\""}

Today, the Board of Management of BMW AG has changed the outlook for the 2025 financial year.\n\nWhereas the company delivered volume growth year to date September in the European and Americas regions, however, the targeted volume growth in China remained below expectations. On this basis, the BMW Group decided to reduce volume expectations for the Chinese market in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the impact of a significant reduction of commissions from local Chinese banks in connection with the brokering of financial and insurance products to end customers requires financial support to strengthen dealer profitability.\n\nFurthermore, some of the assumptions on tariff reductions made at the time of its half year reporting have not been fully realised to date. In this context the BMW Group continues, however, to maintain the assumption that the EU implement the agreement with the US on reduction of tariffs from 10% to 0% on the import of vehicles and auto parts into the EU effective 1st August.\n\nAccounting for these additional factors weighing on profit, the Auto EBIT margin for 2025 will remain in the guided corridor of 5% to 7%, more specifically in the range of 5% to 6%.\n\nThe outlook for the 2025 financial year has been adjusted as follows:\n\nContrary to assumptions made to date, the BMW Group now assumes that reimbursements of customs duties from the American and German authorities totaling a high three-digit million figure will not be received in 2025, but only paid in 2026. Considering these reimbursements and the impact on profit outlined above, free cashflow in Segment Automotive for the year 2025 is expected to be above €2.5bn (previously above €5bn).\n\nThe dividend payout ratio remains in the corridor of 30% to 40% of net income attributable to BMW AG shareholders. Additionally, the BMW Group remains committed to the share buyback program.\n\nThe full quarterly results and the adjusted outlook report will be published on 5 November 2025 in the BMW Group Quarterly Statement to 30 September 2025. The definitions of the KPIs can be found in the Glossary of the BMW Group Report 2024 on pages 427 to 429.\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Communications Finance\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann, Head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nWith its four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services. The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide; the company has a global sales network in more than 140 countries.\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action.

From October 15 to 19, Frieze London and Frieze Masters will return to London’s Regent’s Park. As one of Frieze’s long-standing global partners since 2004, BMW honours the artistic work of David Hockney as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour and provides VIP shuttle service. Frieze London takes its place on the global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enriched by a vibrant array of events.\n\nThe iconic Art Car #14, designed by David Hockney 30 years ago, will be on display in The Lobby of The Peninsula London from October 14 to November 3. During the “Peninsula Classic Car Afternoon Tea” which runs through November 18 there will be a special opportunity to engage with Hockney’s Art Car: BMW representatives will dive deep into the origins and lead through the journey of Hockney’s Art Car design on October 14 and 15. Sculptural culinary delights will be served to bring together the British tea tradition and the BMW Art Cars’ golden jubilee. The final days of the exhibition coincide with RM Sotheby’s Classic Car auction presented in partnership with the Royal Automobile Club which brings a selection of significant automobiles– from historic treasures to modern collectibles – to The Peninsula.\n\nDavid Hockney’s BMW 850CSi puts a new spin on the traditional idea of a car’s paintwork by effectively turning the car inside out. “I thought it would be a good idea to show the car as if one could see inside,” he said. Like an X-ray, Hockney’s design reveals the anatomy of the car and its occupants: the door sports an outline of the driver, and Hockney’s loyal dachshund, Stanley, can be seen sitting on the back seat, referencing the artist’s love of his dogs. Stylised engine components are depicted on the bonnet, while expanses of green sweep across the body – a visual metaphor for the passing scenery, movement, and time. Hockney’s visual language melds the car’s interior and the outside world to create a new and unusual perspective on motoring.\n\nBorn in Bradford, England, in 1937, David Hockney has been one of the most flamboyant and influential protagonists on the international art scene since the early 1960s. He graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1962 and soon joined the exclusive circles of Swinging Sixties London. He established his style as his very own form of international Pop Art and achieved great popularity with it. His works – among them iconic images depicting swimming pools and Californian landscapes – illustrate his lifelong fascination with light, colour, and the relationship between perspective and movement. David Hockney’s Art Car was intended solely as an exhibition piece and has never been driven on the road or in a race.\n\nThe BMW Art Car World Tour charts an ambitious course, with stops at prestigious destinations such as Art Basel Hong Kong, the Le Mans Classic in France, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix, the Shanghai Motor Show in China, and Italy’s Concorso d’Eleganza, among others. Showcasing the collection of 20 iconic BMW Art Cars, the tour serves as a testament to the company’s deep-rooted commitment to global cultural engagement – spanning more than a hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music, film, and design.

Visitors will have the opportunity to admire iconic BMW Art Cars set against the backdrop of the Zoute Grand Prix (8-12 October 2025), an event renowned for celebrating automotive heritage, design elegance, and the timeless beauty of classic automobiles. The unique convergence of art and motoring provides a rare chance for the public to witness the seamless fusion of engineering and creative vision into a truly singular experience.\n\nThe presence of BMW Art Cars in Belgium highlights the global impact of the BMW Art Car initiative and its ability to connect diverse audiences through bold and compelling visual storytelling. By pairing the Art Car exhibition with the Zoute Grand Prix, BMW and the event organisers foster a dialogue between the timeless romance of classic cars and the ever-evolving language of contemporary art. This juxtaposition invites reflection on the intersection of movement, form, and identity— and how design continues to bring life into heritage.\n\nThe BMW Art Cars arriving in Belgium have travelled from across the world, including Julie Mehretu BMW M Hybrid V8, which was recently exhibited in New York and Istanbul. It joins masterpieces by Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Robert Rauschenberg, Matazo Kayama, Cesar Manrique, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, and Jeff Koons for this very special public presentation.\n\nAnother milestone is that 2025 marks the centenary of Robert Rauschenberg’s birth, offering a unique opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this pioneering American artist. This occasion will be commemorated with a year-long programme of international exhibitions and events. These will highlight his enduring influence on subsequent generations of artists and his dedication to social progress.\n\nThe the Zoute Grand Prix. Held annually in Knokke-Heist, the Zoute Grand Prix is one of Europe’s most prestigious automotive events, where heritage, design, and innovation come together. The gathering unites collectors, enthusiasts, and creators to celebrate automotive culture.\n\nFor more information, please visit: \n\nCelebrating 50 Years: The BMW Art Car Collection.The BMW Art Car initiative came from French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, who, together with then BMW Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, asked his artist friend Alexander Calder to paint a car. The result was a completely reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which went on to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975 and became a crowd favorite. In the years that followed, art icons like Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, and Julie Mehretu have enriched the collection, each in their own individual style.\n\nThe BMW vehicles that have been turned into works of art using a wide variety of graphic and artistic techniques are as different as the artists themselves – from pure racing thoroughbreds to production vehicles and rare sports cars. The results are all vastly different. No two vehicles are alike. BMW Art Car artists are selected by an independent worldwide jury of museum directors and curators, and the artist always maintains complete creative freedom throughout the entire process.\n\nBMW Group’s global cultural engagement and updates on the Art Car World Tour can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}

BMW is bringing innovation and electric mobility into new areas of life with its new electric stand-up paddleboard (SUP). The BMW x SipaBoards is the product of a collaboration with Slovenian manufacturer SipaBoards, the market leader in the field. The boards are self-inflating and combine electric drive technology with high-grade materials, digital connectivity and a flexible energy system. This is the first time BMW has offered an electrically powered product designed for water sports, opening up a new chapter in riding pleasure in the process. BMW Group Designworks took care of the visuals.\n\nElectric lifestyle on the water.\n\nStand-up paddleboarding has grown into an extremely popular, on-trend sport over recent years. It brings together physical activity, immersion in nature and low barriers to entry – and therefore appeals to first-timers and experienced water sports enthusiasts alike. The BMW x SipaBoards brings a new dimension to the paddleboarding experience in the form of electric assistance, connectivity and intuitive control. The result is a new level of mobility on the water and the confluence of comfort and adventure.\n\nAt the heart of the BMW x SipaBoards is an integrated motor generating up to 300 watts of power. It produces additional thrust while on the move and makes paddling easier – especially into headwinds or currents. The drivetrain, with a propeller developed specifically for BMW, runs emission-free and near silently, and delivers a unique riding experience at speeds of up to 7.5 km/h (4 knots). The motor also comes in handy by pumping up the board automatically before you head out. The requisite energy is supplied by battery modules, which are available with a range of different capacities – to respond to individual requirements – and can be swapped out in just a few simple steps.\n\nStructural solidity and extensive connectivity.\n\nIts specially developed X-woven drop-stitch core gives the e-SUP superb structural rigidity and stability. The board is intuitive to use, via a new user interface (UI) with Bluetooth remote control – whose design was inspired by the BMW Neue Klasse – built into the paddle. It allows the rider to toggle into FREUDE Mode for extra power, eye-catching light effects and haptic feedback. A smartphone app brings additional functionality, enabling users to plan routes, for example, monitor the battery charge and utilise GPS tracking. An additional safety feature is the automatic power cut-off, which is triggered by a Bluetooth signal. If the paddle falls into the water, a return signal is immediately transmitted that automatically cuts the motor. This means the board remains under control at all times, including in unexpected situations, and makes riding extremely safe.\n\nFun for up to two people per SUP.\n\nThe board and all-carbon-fibre paddle fuse robustness with lightness, and deliver an exceptional on-the-water riding experience.

The dream of a fourth DTM drivers' title for René Rast (GER) has been shattered. In the final race of the season at the Hockenheimring (GER), the 38-year-old had excellent chances in the showdown for the championship after a strong start, running in second place. However, a collision in the first lap ended all his hopes. On Friday, ahead of the race weekend, Rast had announced his provisional retirement from DTM. Marco Wittmann (GER) shone in the Sunday race, securing a podium finish in second place during a dramatic season finale.\n\nAfter finishing seventh on Saturday, Rast started Sunday’s race from fifth position but quickly moved up to second place in the first few corners thanks to a brilliant start. However, at the hairpin, he was pushed wide and, as a result of a chain reaction, was hit twice by other cars. His #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO sustained such severe damage that he had to retire from the race in the very first lap, ending his bid for a fourth DTM title. A victory, which was well within reach, would have been enough to crown him champion. Thus, Rast concluded what is, at least for now, his final DTM season in position sixth in the drivers' standings.\n\nOn Friday, Rast had already announced that he would not compete in DTM in 2026, choosing instead to focus on other race programmes with BMW M Motorsport. Over eight full seasons, Rast achieved three titles, 31 victories, and 26 pole positions. He did not rule out a potential return to DTM at a later date.\n\nFor Marco Wittmann, the season ended with a fantastic comeback and a dramatic final lap. Starting from 17th on the grid, Wittmann climbed to second place and challenged Ayhancan Güven (TUR, Porsche) for the race win in the final sprint, as Güven was fighting for the championship title. Wittmann initially overtook Güven but was countered by a bold move from Güven just a few corners before the finish line. Thanks to his second-place finish, Wittmann ended the season in position five in the drivers' standings. Schubert Motorsport secured second place in the team standings. The team from Oschersleben (GER) celebrated a total of three victories by Rast and six additional podium finishes in 2025 – two for Rast and four for Wittmann.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Podium finish for FK Performance Motorsport to close the season. As in the DTM, BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers were in the title fight until the final weekend in Hockenheim in the supporting series ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany. However, the ultimate success also eluded them there. In the ADAC GT Masters, the FK Performance Motorsport duo Leyton Fourie (RSA) and Tim Zimmermann (GER) in the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO ended the season on a positive note with a second-place podium finish.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Congratulations to Marco Wittmann for a fantastic podium finish in Sunday’s race. That was a very strong performance. However, looking at the championship, the disappointment naturally outweighs the positives. After Marco was practically out of the race on Saturday due to a tyre issue, things looked very promising for René Rast. He had a strong weekend and was already in second place after the start on Sunday. Unfortunately, the collision at the hairpin cost him all his chances. We would have preferred to fight for the title until the final lap, but it wasn’t meant to be. Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport for a very good season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. We were in the title race with both drivers until the final weekend, which underscores our consistently strong performance. The pit stops by the crews were especially outstanding. Congratulations to Ayhancan Güven and Manthey EMA on winning the title!\"\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"We can all be proud of this DTM season. We were in the title fight until the very end and have made significant progress compared to last year. René Rast and Marco Wittmann were very close throughout the season and brought success to the team together. It’s bitter that the season ended this way. We lost René in the first lap, and Marco would have deserved the win in the final race. Unfortunately, it wasn’t meant to be, but we’ll come back stronger next season. In the ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany, we unfortunately lost our title chances as well. Nevertheless, the podium finish for FK Performance Motorsport in the ADAC GT Masters is a positive conclusion. Our teams and drivers have learned a lot and will surely come back stronger.\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal, Schubert Motorsport): \"It’s incredibly unfortunate that René Rast’s race ended so early today. He was already past Ayhancan Güven but was then pushed wide, leading to the unfortunate collision. Such incidents can happen in the tight DTM starts. You could see from Marco Wittmann's pace, the strong strategy, and the quick pit stops what would have been possible for René today as well. Marco stormed from 17th to second place and truly deserved the win. He drove a fantastic race. Overall, we had a good season and celebrated several victories. Our pit stops were consistently top-level. It would have been well-deserved for us to finish at the top of the championship standings. But we’ll take it as it is and come back stronger next season.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 18th place, R2: 2nd place): \"Climbing from 17th to second was a strong statement to end the season, I think. The final lap is certainly up for debate. I was already past Ayhancan Güven, and his counter-move in the Sachs Curve was borderline from my perspective. Nevertheless, it was a nice season finale for me. Of course, I feel very sorry for René that he was taken out of the race so early. I think we had a strong package today. Overall, it was a crazy season with a title fight that I believe is rare in DTM. We lost too much ground at some events, which ultimately took us out of the title fight. Still, we can be satisfied in the end. This season provides a solid foundation to build on.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 7th place, R2: DNF): \"I’m at a loss for words after this bitter end to the season. My start in Sunday’s race was fantastic; I was already in second place, and the pace of our car was excellent. I think a win was absolutely possible. To be taken out of the title fight in this way in the first lap is incredibly bitter. This is not the conclusion I had dreamed of for my DTM career. However, I decided some time ago to at least temporarily end my DTM journey. I will not be competing in the DTM in 2026. This decision was not an easy one for me, as this racing series has been like a second home to me. I would like to sincerely thank all the teams I have raced with, the mechanics who gave their all in the garage, and the engineers who never stopped striving for perfection. Without your hard work and passion, my successes would not have been possible. I am also deeply grateful for the memories, the victories, the challenges, and especially for the fans who have supported me every step of the way. Even though I won’t be on the DTM grid next year, I am excited about the opportunities ahead – and who knows what the future will bring?\""}

Construction of BMW Group’s new high-voltage battery assembly plant in the municipalities of Irlbach and Straßkirchen (Straubing-Bogen district) is progressing at high speed.\n\n“With the completion of the Energy Centre building and the fire station, we have reached the next important milestone on the road to serial production for the new generation 6 high-voltage batteries here in Lower Bavaria,” says Sabrina Kugler, Project Manager for Plant Construction Irlbach-Straßkirchen. “The Energy Centre supplies the new plant with all the essential utilities. In addition, there are around 3,000 square metres with optimal conditions for the fire department.”\n\nFor safety: Fire service on duty 24/7\n\nIn June, the BMW fire brigade began its around-the-clock duty on the BMW Group Irlbach-Straßkirchen site. With five service vehicles and 26 people working in shifts, the fire service will ensure the safety of employees at the site. The accreditation process as a plant fire brigade is currently underway.\n\nThe team comprises experienced colleagues from other BMW Group sites in Bavaria as well as newly trained plant firefighters recruited from the region. Two of the new employees are also active in the volunteer fire departments in Irlbach and Straßkirchen. Training events and exercises continue to be closely coordinated with the nearby municipal fire brigades.\n\nCentral control unit for all essential resources\n\nFor Silvia Meyer, Head of Real Estate Management at the Irlbach-Straßkirchen plant, the Energy Centre is the “heart” of the new high-voltage battery assembly plant. “Here future production and the ancillary buildings are supplied with all necessary media – electricity, cooling, heat, cooling water and compressed air.” The utility media are controlled in the so-called Operations Centre. The building’s heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting are controlled automatically and resource-efficiently via the energy control technology installed there. With the help of sensors, all key production facilities and rooms are continuously monitored and visualised in real time on the control room screens.\n\nWaste heat from production used for heating\n\nWaste heat from the production processes is used to heat the canteen, storage and ancillary buildings at low temperatures. To do this, heat pumps in the Energy Centre convert the roughly 23°C chilled water heated by the production plants into heating energy at about 60°C. Four heat pumps, each with 1.8 MW, guarantee fault-tolerant heating capacity.\n\nThe entire piping system of the Energy Centre extends over 3.8 kilometres and is initially filled with 500,000 litres of water. The production and assembly process for high-voltage batteries requires no water. Drinking water at the site is used only for kitchens and washbasins. Rainwater collected on the roofs is used for toilets.\n\nHighly automated production process requires compressed air\n\nThe highly automated material-handling technology in the production process for high-voltage batteries continuously requires compressed air. The energy center supplies compressed air at 6 bar to the systems in the production. Two redundant compressors cover base load, and a variable compressor covers peak load. The waste heat from the compressors is also fed into the cooling-water circuit and again available for heating the factory via the heat pumps.\n\nPlant runs exclusively on renewable electricity\n\nAlthough a natural gas pipeline runs across the site, the energy supply for the BMW Group Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen in regular operation relies entirely on non-fossil energy sources. The plant is not connected to the natural gas pipeline.\n\nAt the new site, electricity is generated from solar energy to cover part of the total power demand. A photovoltaic installation will be installed on a roof area of around 62,000 square metres. The extent is more than a third of the roof area of the future production building, i.e. about the size of nine football pitches. The PV system will be installed and operated by the energy supplier VERBUND. Construction will begin in spring 2026, allowing it to be commissioned in time for the start of serial production. Nearly 14,000 photovoltaic modules can deliver over 6 MW peak (MWp) and thus generate more than 6,000 MWh per year. Any additional external electricity required will come entirely from renewable sources.\n\nThe electrical supply of the assembly plant will be provided via underground 110 kV cables connected to a substation operated by Bayernwerk Netz GmbH in Irlbach, which is currently under construction. Until the substation is completed in 2028, a provisional 34 MW connection to the existing 110 kV high-voltage lines will ensure a stable power supply for the current construction site and the future production operation.\n\nIn addition, two own transformers with a maximum reference capacity of 68 MW have been installed on the site near the Energy Centre. They initially convert the 110 kV supply to 20 kV for distribution on the site. Transformers located close to consumption provide the 230 V and 400 V supplies.\n\nRadio mast secures mobile phone coverage\n\nThe Energy Centre also plays a key role in the plant’s mobile phone coverage: a radio mast on the roof of the Energy Centre provides mobile coverage for the outdoor areas of the site. Inside the plant, around 220 antennas have already been installed in various buildings, and more than 9.5 kilometres of RF cable and 3.5 kilometres of fibre optic cable have been laid to ensure coverage across the entire site.\n\nDigital planning tool BIM accelerates construction progress\n\nThe approximately 10,400 square metre building for the Energy Centre and Fire Station was completed in just under 14 months.\n\nA key contributor to this short construction period was Building Information Modelling (BIM), a digital planning method. BMW Group applies the BIM approach consistently in all planning and realisation processes for the new Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen. The system networks data and workflows of all project participants from planning through construction to operation.\n\nThe use of BIM ensures that all project participants have access to the current planning status. The method helps identify and optimise interfaces between all project participants at an early stage. An autonomous drone is used to continuously compare the current construction progress (as-built) with the digital building model (as-planned). Deviations are identified quickly so that corresponding measures can be taken. BIM is thus a fundamental component for a smooth commissioning, acceptance and handover (IAÜ process) of the buildings and systems.\n\nFurther information on the BMW Group plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen can be found on the project website –"}

BMW Group Plant Leipzig is planning a hydrogen pipeline link – paving the way for it to become the first car plant in the world to receive hydrogen via a pipeline. Contracts have now been signed with MITNETZ GAS GmbH and ONTRAS Gastransport GmbH. The approx. 2-kilometre-long link will be constructed by MITNETZ GAS and incorporate a gas pressure and measurement system, eventually connecting the plant to the future core hydrogen network. BMW and ONTRAS are in the process of agreeing the appropriate connection to the hydrogen grid. The link is expected to start delivering hydrogen to the plant in mid-2027.\n\nOnce the pipeline is in place, Plant Leipzig will no longer need hydrogen deliveries by truck, in cylinders. “With supplies coming in via the pipeline, we will be able to use hydrogen in completely new ways – especially for our most energy-intensive processes, such as our curing ovens in the paintshop,” says Petra Peterhänsel, Director of BMW Group Plant Leipzig.\n\nIn October 2022 Plant Leipzig took a fuel-flexible burner on stream in its paintshop – another world first in automotive production. Today, it operates a total of eleven such bivalent burners, powered flexibly by gas or hydrogen.\n\nIn 2013 Leipzig also introduced hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklifts and tug trains and now operates an intralogistics fleet comprising more than 230 vehicles of this kind – the largest in Europe. They refuel at nine hydrogen refuelling stations located within the plant’s halls.\n\nThe core hydrogen network is a nationwide infrastructure project that will consist of approx. 9,000 kilometres of hydrogen pipes.

As part of a racing weekend organized by Dener Motorsports at the former Formula 1 circuit “Circuito Estoril” near Lisbon/Portugal, a tribute event for the three-time Formula 1 world champion took place on the last weekend in August. The participation of BMW Group Classic occurred in close cooperation with Dener Pires, a close friend of Nelson Piquet.\n\nBMW Group Classic brought two of Nelson Piquet's legendary racing cars to the event. A Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo, in which he became the first turbo world champion in Formula 1 in 1983, and a BMW M1 Procar, in which he became BMW Procar champion in 1980.\n\nNelson Piquet grabbed the steering wheel on two days, first completing a shake-down in both cars and then doing a few laps of honour in the Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo the following day. Bernie Ecclestone, then Brabham team owner, Gordon Murray, then vehicle designer, and former Brabham racing mechanics travelled to Estoril especially for the event.\n\nThe last time Nelson Piquet drove his BMW Formula 1 car was 2015 at a Formula 1 Legends event in Spielberg, Austria. Ten years later, he travelled all the way from Brazil to Europe to take the wheel of his two legendary BMW racing cars himself, probably for the last time.\n\nThe racing mechanics from BMW Group Classic ensured that the vehicles were provided in perfect condition and also accompanied the event on site.\n\nAfter the Festival of Speed in Goodwood, the Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo completed its second drive this year.\n\nFour questions for Nelson Piquet:\n\nWhat do you think when you see the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo today, after so many years?\n\nThe car was and is beautiful. It is a work of art. It was the best time of my life.\n\nWhat is your most vivid memory of the 1983 Formula 1 season?\n\nI remember the many test drives. I spent around 33,000 kilometres in the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo during test drives. In addition, there were around 7,000 kilometres during the 15 Formula 1 race weekends, including the training and qualifying sessions. We had a racing team, a Brabham test team and a BMW test team. We drove a lot. Back then, it was perhaps more personal and more like a family within the team.\n\nWhat was decisive for the Formula 1 world championship title in 1983?\n\nThe BMW turbo engine, although it was developed later than the competition. We developed the car and the engine in 1982 and won the championship in 1983. That was fantastic.\n\nBMW also used telemetry data transmission systems for the first time. These were not intended for driving or tuning the car, but only for the engine. But they were still very helpful.\n\nWe were able to solve technical problems quickly. For example, we had problems with fuel consumption that could be solved immediately after the race weekend during test drives. And we also had an extremely strong gearbox.\n\nHow difficult was it to handle the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo with its enormous power?\n\nBack then, it was normal to deal with the power. Today it is very difficult and I brake much earlier than I did in the past.\n\nFormula 1 career of Nelson Piquet:\n\n1978-1991: 204 GPs, 23 GP victories (including 7 for BMW), 485.5 GP points\n\n20x second, 17x third\n\n3x world champion: 1981, 1983 (on BMW) and 1987\n\n1980 runner-up world champion\n\nBMW entries/successes of Nelson Piquet:\n\n1980: Winner of the Procar series in a BMW M1\n\n1981: Winner of the 1000km race at the Nürburgring in a BMW M1 Group 5 (with H.J.

With victories in all three Grand Prix classes, including five in MotoGP, he brings valuable experience and a high level of professionalism to our project. Together with Danilo Petrucci, his new teammate, he forms a strong and competitive rider duo. The two already know each other well. This constellation gives us the opportunity to take the next steps in our development and to further reinforce BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s ambitions in WorldSBK. The entire team is very much looking forward to working with him. But for now, our focus is on the remaining races of this season, with big goals: we want to win the world championship title again with Toprak Razgatlioglu and build on Michael van der Mark’s strong performance at Magny-Cours in order to also play a decisive role in the battle for the manufacturers’ title. Michael’s time in our WorldSBK project will come to an end after this season. I would like to sincerely thank him for his commitment, his successes and his achievements during his five years in our WorldSBK team. We are currently working on opportunities for further collaboration with him within the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family and would be delighted to move into a new future together with him.”\n\nOliveira says: “To join the BMW family in the World Superbike Championship is an exciting step in my career, one in which I see tremendous potential. I am becoming part of a project that is not only ambitious and competitive, but has also made a significant impact on both the championship and the motorcycle industry. Being involved with a new team, working alongside strong partners, and embracing a new championship format gives me great motivation to deliver my very best. I want to sincerely thank Mr. Sven Blusch, Technical Director Chris Gonschor and Team Principal Shaun Muir for their trust and enthusiasm. I can’t wait to begin this new chapter together.”"}

The 45th Ryder Cup on the Black Course at Bethpage State Park near New York will be remembered for a long time. Since 1927, the enthralling team duel between the best golfers from the USA and Europe has written countless legendary stories. With their 15-13 victory on foreign soil, the defending champions added another stunning chapter. On Saturday, the Europeans achieved the largest lead (11.5-4.5) any team has held after two days since Europe began competing against the USA in 1979. In Sunday’s singles matches, the Americans nearly overturned what seemed like an insurmountable deficit, before Shane Lowry (IRL) delivered the decisive half-point on the way to the fifth away victory for Team Europe since 1979.\n\nCaptain Luke Donald (ENG) continued to maintain his flawless Ryder Cup record. As a player, the former world number one won the Ryder Cup trophy in all four of his appearances (2004, 2006, 2010, and 2012). Now, as a captain, he has two triumphs to his name. Two years ago, Donald also led Team Europe to victory. Just as in Rome, Team Europe impressed in the heated atmosphere of Bethpage Black with a consistently strong team performance, hitting the ground running from the very start. The Europeans won all four foursome sessions on Friday and Saturday – a remarkable first as no team had ever even claimed the first three sessions before.\n\nJust when everything seemed to point to a landslide victory for the visitors, the tide turned dramatically on Sunday. The U.S. team took the lead in one singles match after another, and a sporting miracle suddenly seemed within reach. By the end of Sunday, Europe would win only a single match (Ludvig Åberg, SWE, against Patrick Cantlay) but still manage to hold on to their lead. It was Shane Lowry who ultimately secured the throphy by winning the 18th hole in his match against Russell Henley, earning the crucial half-point that brought the European team to 14 points – enough to retain the trophy as defending champions.\n\nOne of the most spectacular holes on Bethpage Black is the 14th, a short par 3 where numerous breathtaking shots and decisive moments unfolded over the last three days. BMW customers and guests had the privilege of witnessing this up close from the BMW House, which featured its own grandstand directly behind the tee. The 14th tee also served as the perfect stage for the new BMW iX3, the first series-produced Neue Klasse model. The new-generation BMW iX3 is a fully electric Sports Activity Vehicle that gives customers their first on-the-road taste of a whole new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure.\n\nBMW supported the smooth execution of the 45th Ryder Cup with a fleet of over 200 vehicles, ensuring safe transportation for members of the golf and event teams as well as BMW guests to and from the venue. Like BMW customers in many countries, they enjoyed the exclusive opportunity to follow the Ryder Cup live from inside their vehicles.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679-805km."}

With an impressive ceremony that artistically combined Hungarian culture and modern automotive production, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, today officially opened the BMW Group plant in Debrecen. The BMW Group’s newest and most innovative production site marks the beginning of a new era for the company. In late October, the new BMW iX3 will enter series production in the Hungarian university town of Debrecen as the first vehicle of the Neue Klasse. Plant Debrecen was planned virtually and realised in practice fully in line with the principles of the BMW iFACTORY, becoming the first BMW Group car plant to rely entirely on electricity from renewable energy during normal operation.\n\nIn addition to Oliver Zipse, high-ranking representatives from Hungarian politics, such as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the Mayor of Debrecen, László Papp, as well as Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management for Production, Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management for Human Resources and Real Estate, and Hans-Peter Kemser, President and CEO BMW Manufacturing Hungary Kft., attended the grand opening.\n\n“In our global production network, our new plant in Debrecen is a pioneer: It is our first fully-electric plant, the first production site to operate entirely without fossil fuels – and the first to build vehicles for the Neue Klasse. This makes our plant in Debrecen a decisive factor in the BMW Group's future success,” said Oliver Zipse. “The opening also sends a strong signal: We are expanding our footprint on our home continent and reaffirming our commitment to Europe as a strong and competitive location for industry.”\n\nHans-Peter Kemser added at the ceremony: “This is not only a new BMW Group plant – it is a cornerstone of progress. We are a partner to culture, to education and to the University of Debrecen, where together we foster the talents that will shape the future. And above all, it is a community – deeply embedded in the life of Debrecen and Hungary.”\n\nStrengthening the industrial base and expanding training\n\nThe official opening ceremony began with a look back at the plant’s construction, following a 2018 decision that launched one of Hungary’s largest greenfield investments. The BMW Group’s first Central European location has firmly placed Debrecen on the region's automotive map, creating more than 2,000 direct jobs – and many more along the supply chain, at regional suppliers and service providers that have recently established themselves in Debrecen, alongside national and international companies. The new plant has also strengthened the industrial park and driven additional investment in transport and infrastructure.\n\nAt the same time, through collaborations with institutions such as the local university and the Vocational Training Centre of Debrecen, DSZC, Plant Debrecen has also become one of the largest training hubs for dual education programmes in Hungary.\n\nOnly the best of the best for Debrecen\n\nPlant Debrecen is the first BMW Group production site not tied to a specific primary plant. Instead, it serves as a network plant, combining best practices from different locations worldwide. For example, the press shop is modelled on the systems used in Spartanburg (USA) and Swindon (Great Britain), with their know-how and technologies further refined for Debrecen. In the body shop, the positioning of nearly 1,000 industrial robots, along with their processes, was digitally simulated in detail beforehand. The number of joining methods was also significantly reduced, with further streamlining allowing design features for the Neue Klasse to be integrated early in development.\n\nPaint shop key to largest reduction in CO2e emissions\n\nAt BMW Group Plant Debrecen, the paint shop plays a critical role in significantly reducing the BMW iX3’s CO2e footprint. Production of the new BMW iX3 will generate a total of about 80kg CO₂e (scope 1/2 emissions). This figure covers CO₂e emissions from Plant Debrecen, as well as in-house parts production at other BMW Group facilities, including components manufactured in Landshut, for example. This represents a reduction of approx. two-thirds compared to production of existing BMW derivatives. For Plant Debrecen alone, this approach will reduce CO₂e emissions from the manufacture of a vehicle, including its high-voltage battery, by around 90% – to about 34 kg CO₂e (when operating at full capacity, compared with other BMW Group facilities).\n\nAbout a quarter of the plant's annual power needs will be supplied by the 50‑hectare on-site photovoltaic system, one of the largest in Hungary. Surplus solar energy, such as that generated on non-working days, is stored in a 1,800 m³ thermal storage system with a capacity of 130 MWh.\n\nDigitalised assembly processes and smart “finger structure”\n\nComplete digitalisation of production processes further boosts assembly efficiency – for example, sensors and camera systems along the production line are used to automate quality processes. AI evaluates the data and provides real-time feedback to employees on the assembly line. The building's “finger structure” – an optimised version of BMW Group Plant Leipzig – allows 80% of parts to be delivered directly to the correct point of assembly on the line. In-house logistics are fully electric.\n\nHigh-voltage battery assembly in line with “local for local” principle\n\nHigh-voltage batteries are assembled directly on site, allowing for short distances in line with the “local for local” principle. Plant Debrecen will be the first of five plants worldwide to begin series production of Gen6 high-voltage batteries at this location. Seamless in-line quality inspections and 100% end‑of‑line monitoring enable a consistent zero-defect approach.\n\nFinal photo with employees and two BMW iX3s\n\nThe opening ceremony concluded with a music and dance performance celebrating Hungarian culture and traditions, which the BMW Group also supports through local events and organisations. To wrap up, numerous employees joined Viktor Orbán and Oliver Zipse on stage, alongside two new BMW iX3s.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO₂-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km"}

In the heart of the Abruzzo National Park, “Stasis” – the new installation by Velasco Vitali for ARTEPARCO – has been unveiled. The project, which for the past eight years has been transforming nature into an open-air museum, introduces many innovations in its 2025 edition, including an interactive web app and a short film resulting from the collaboration between BMW Group Italia, Main Partner of the initiative, and Scuola Holden.\n\nARTEPARCO is an initiative launched in 2018 that highlights the unique landscape of the Abruzzo National Park, Lazio e Molise through contemporary art interventions. It also celebrates the synergy between culture and environmental sustainability.\n\nBMW Italia has reaffirmed its commitment to this project through 2025, supporting its evolution into a true open-air museum that guides visitors in discovering artworks situated within the heart of the Park. Recognized for its dedication to territorial enhancement, the initiative benefits from the Patronage of the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security.\n\nStarting from Pescasseroli (AQ), visitors can explore the Park’s trails, C1 and C2, and encounter works by artists with diverse stylistic backgrounds who have engaged with this pristine environment over the years, including Marcantonio, Matteo Fato, Alessandro Pavone, Sissi, Valerio Berruti, Accademia di Aracne, and megx.\n\nOn July 18th, the eighth edition of ARTEPARCO was unveiled, featuring Velasco Vitali’s “Stasis” (born in Bellano, 1960), a prominent figure in contemporary Italian art. Inspired by the Ancient Beech Forests, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the artist created a piece that pays homage to the Park’s fauna. The artwork transforms a raw oak trunk into a natural column, crowned by a depiction of an Apennine wolf—symbolizing nature and serving as a metaphor for modern society, which is still on a journey of discovery.\n\nConceived by Abruzzese entrepreneur and communicator Paride Vitale, ARTEPARCO has become a well-established event in contemporary art, with aspirations to evolve into an open museum without walls.\n\nThe initiative is promoted by BMW Italia within the framework of Corporate Citizenship, under the campaign \"SpecialMente #Drivenbypeople,\" aiming to build a robust cultural and sustainable network.\n\nIn 2025, the program introduced innovative features for visitors, including a web app accessible via arteparco.com. This digital platform allows users to explore the Park’s route and artworks through an interactive map and specially designed audio guides narrated by Victoria Cabello – Italian - British actress and television presenter – and Paride Vitale.\n\nFurthering its commitment to storytelling and social responsibility, BMW Italia partnered with the Scuola Holden to produce a documentary capturing the key moments of the “Stasis” installation.\n\nA young team from the Scuola produced an evocative long-form video that explores the main themes of the 2025 edition. This includes insights into the project's inception and the dialogue between the artist and the Park’s collaborators involved in integrating the artwork among the beech trees along the trail. The film, available on BMW Italia’s Specialmente.bmw.it website and on arteparco.com, presents the interpretation of the project through a dedicated and unique viewpoint.\n\nIn addition to the long video, the SpecialMente website features five other episodic videos that highlight the individuals involved with the Park—those who, every day, contribute with pride to its preservation and conservation. These stories are shared through communication videos published on the BMW Group Italia LinkedIn channel, showcasing the diverse efforts supporting the Park’s safeguarding.\n\nVelasco Vitali “Stasis”Inspired by the Ancient Beech Forests—designated as a UNESCO World Heritage SiteVin 2017—Vitali’s \"Stasis\" pays tribute to the Park’s wildlife. The piece references stylites, ascetics from antiquity who lived atop columns or pillars in prayer and spiritual elevation. It reflects on the concept of balance, intertwining physical and contemplative dimensions, and is connected to the artist’s \"Torre\" series, created between 2005 and 2010.\n\nThe artwork features a semi-worked, raw oak trunk transformed into a natural column, topped with an acanthus leaf-capital. At its summit stands an Apennine wolf, embodying the wildness of nature and serving as a metaphor for contemporary society’s ongoing quest for awareness and understanding. Vitali describes his vision: “For the Ancient Beech Forests of the Park, I envisioned a symbolic sculpture as a starting point for a journey where each individual leaves their mark, testifying to their bond with the land. It’s an invitation to craft a ‘geography of the mind,’ composed of connections, exchanges, and awareness of our existence.”\n\nElements of the sculpture, cast in aluminum at the historic Fonderia Artistica Battaglia in Milan, are designed to age naturally, with a patina that will develop an elegant patina over time, allowing the environment to further enhance Vitali’s work.\n\nPositioned discreetly within a secluded clearing at the end of a Park trail, \"Stasis\" harmoniously integrates into the landscape, exemplifying a meaningful synthesis of art and nature.\n\nThe BMW Group's cultural engagement, including exclusive updates and deeper insights into its worldwide cultural initiatives, can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}

The German basketball champions enjoyed a successful start to the new season. At the national league opener, fans at BMW Park celebrated a 93-77 FC Bayern Basketball victory over newly promoted Science City Jena. For the third year of the partnership between BMW Munich and FC Bayern Basketball, dunks count twice at home games: once for the result and once for charity, the BMW initiative ‘Dunks for Tomorrow’. The 1,000 euros per home game dunk scored by the Bayern basketballers, with which BMW Munich supports the charitable organisation DEIN MÜNCHEN, will be going towards the new project ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ as of this season. Young people are key for the future but youths from difficult backgrounds are lacking contacts, opportunities and spaces in which they can develop a positive perspective. Which is where ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ steps in.\n\nThe name being inspired by ‘Dunks for Tomorrow’ highlights the close ties with BMW Munich’s social commitment. “We’re delighted to be providing DEIN MÜNCHEN with long-term support through the ‘Dunks for Tomorrow’ initiative and in doing so to be facilitating a totally new programme within the organisation,” said Bernd Döpke, Head of BMW Munich. “In the successful collaboration with DEIN MÜNCHEN and FC Bayern Basketball, we are taking the next step to make a difference in our home city of Munich in the long term and to create future opportunities for young people who come from challenging environments. This also promotes team spirit and contributes to a vibrant and strong city community.”\n\nMara Bertling, founder and managing director of DEIN MÜNCHEN, adds: “In this project we are arousing curiosity, fuelling courage through positive role models, boosting self-confidence, and opening up prospects. This enables young people to identify their own strengths and develop an approach with which they can play an active role in shaping their future and our community. My thanks go to BMW Munich. The long-term commitment secures the funding of ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ and we – like FC Bayern Basketball – can enter the new season today with big ambitions We want to reach up to 4,000 young people with the programme.”\n\nThe ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ project is divided into three phases. In the first step, around 40 young people will be trained as multipliers and motivators. They will acquire skills in areas such as project management and communications, as well as creativity and strategy development. In the second phase, these 40 young people, who act as an authentic voice for their peer group, will hold more than 30 creative initiatives like workshops, flash mobs, art campaigns, and sporting events at schools, youth centres and in public spaces. Up to 4,000 youths shall be reached under the slogan ‘Boss Your Own Future’.\n\nThe final project module will be an urban, public event at which the young people will present the projects and ideas they have developed to showcase their potential and prove that they can play an active role in shaping society when they are empowered to do so. ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ teaches young people from disadvantaged backgrounds that it is worth them taking control of their own future and working to shape it positively. The BMW Group will support all three project phases and even provide employees as mentors."}

The tenth race weekend of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) was all about thrilling battles between championship leader Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and runner-up Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati). Starting from first and second on the grid, the two riders delivered breathtaking duels in all three races, keeping the nearly 30,000 spectators on the edge of their seats. In the first main race on Saturday afternoon, Razgatlioglu on the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team came out on top and celebrated his 13th consecutive victory. With this, he tied his own record set during the 2024 season. It was also Razgatlioglu’s first-ever win at MotorLand Aragón.\n\nIn the Superpole Race and in the second main race on Sunday, Bulega narrowly came out ahead each time, with Razgatlioglu finishing second on the podium in both races. In the championship standings, Razgatlioglu leads with 36 points over Bulega with two events remaining in the season. In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW is in second place, just six points behind Ducati.\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) continued his strong form from France at MotorLand Aragón. He finished tenth in the first race and secured the important ninth place in the Superpole Race, starting from the third row for the final second main race on Sunday. There, he was in eighth place on the last lap but unfortunately crashed and retired. The WorldSBK season will conclude with a double-header in October: first at Estoril, Portugal (10th to 12th October) and then the finale at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain (17th to 19th October).\n\nReactions after the MotorLand Aragón round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “We are very positive about this weekend. We collected many important points here wt Aragón. Our goal was to win at this Ducati track, and we achieved that on Saturday with Toprak. On Sunday, we couldn’t beat a flawless Nicolò Bulega, but with two second-place finishes we achieved more excellent results. Mickey also had a generally good weekend. He is back and capable of fighting for the top ten or even the top five. The crash at the end was unfortunate, but overall we can build on this performance. Now we move on to Estoril in the title fight, where we also want to continue competing in the manufacturers’ championship. We had already had a taste of that title fight here when we led after Saturday’s win. We are confident that as a team we will perform well with both riders at Estoril.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a fantastic weekend. We knew that Ducati was the clear favourite here. The track suits their package particularly well but we put up an excellent fight. The races were thrilling, and it was clear: the decision comes down to the last corner. Here, Nicolò and his bike were in a class of their own. On Saturday, Toprak was able to make his way through with a strong manoeuvre and the victory was a wonderful gift for all of us. Sunday was incredibly close as well. Overall, however, we got the maximum out of this weekend. The entire team once again delivered outstanding work and set up the BMW M 1000 RR so that, on a track that doesn’t really favour us, we were absolutely on par. Now we move into the season finale full of motivation. We are more than ready!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Saturday’s victory was very important for me. I had never won here before and I am very happy that I now have my first victory at Aragón under my belt. The races here have been very hard, I was battling with Nicolò all the time but I also enjoyed that. In the second race, I then made a mistake in turn 7 and he could pull a bit of a gap. But even if I had continued to battle with him, my chance to take the win would have been very small because the Ducati had a big advantage in the last corner, it had better grip there, the bike was turning and accelerating well. They have a good package for Aragón. In the races, I tried everything, and I hope everyone enjoyed it! I did my best this weekend, I was very motivated, especially after I won the first race. That was very good for me. Overall, I am not so sad because I knew that Aragón is not a BMW but a Ducati track. We did a very good job, strong races, and it has been a very positive weekend for me. Not for 100 per cent, but I am happy. Now we are going to Estoril, we will see there. Nicolò is strong there, but I am, too.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Overall, the weekend was quite good. From the very first practice, I had a good feeling on the bike. In Superpole it wasn’t quite enough for the front rows, but in the first main race I made it into the top ten. The most important thing was that for Sunday I knew what I could still improve, and together with the team we had some ideas regarding the setup. Tyre wear is quite high here, but we managed that well. In the Superpole Race I really wanted to move up to the ninth position, and I succeeded. In race two I was also able to ride consistently and fight. My goal was to get back into the top five, but we were missing a bit of pace for that. At least I was back in the top eight, but then unfortunately I had a crash on the last lap. Sorry to the team for that. All in all though, I’m optimistic for Estoril and Jerez.”\n\nAir temperature: 16°, track temperature: 24°, humidity: 54%, conditions: dry.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 24°, track temperature: 37°, humidity: 40%, conditions: dry, laps: 18.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 18, 1:49.040\n\nAir temperature: 22°, track temperature: 27°, humidity: 65%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 8, 1:48.165\n\nAir temperature: 26°, track temperature: 31°, humidity: 57%, conditions: dry, laps: 18.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 6, 1:48.427\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R10/12, after 30 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R10/12, after 30 of 36 races)."}

Second place in Austin (USA), third place in Fuji (JPN): the BMW M4 GT3 EVO continues its successful streak in the final stages of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). In the penultimate race at the Fuji International Speedway, Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS) drove the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO to a third-place finish. The trio achieved an impressive comeback from 14th on the grid. The #46 car, which had finished second in Austin, secured another strong fourth-place result this time. In the Hypercar class, the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 crossed the finish line in ninth place, while the #15 car retired after a crash.\n\nThe Japanese fans witnessed a spectacular six-hour race filled with numerous overtakes and collisions. Unfortunately, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), was involved in two incidents. First, Magnussen was hit and spun by another car. Later, Marciello had to avoid a suddenly slowing Hypercar, resulting in a crash into the track barrier, which ended the race for the car.\n\nThe #20 car started from an excellent fifth position after a strong qualifying performance by Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). During the race, he and his teammates René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) fought hard to recover after a drive-through penalty. Their efforts concluded with a ninth-place finish.\n\nBoth BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars in the LMGT3 class delivered spectacular comebacks. After a disappointing qualifying session, the cars started from 11th and 14th positions but quickly worked their way up the field. The final stages turned into a strategic gamble, with the #31 car securing a well-earned third place. Right behind, Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) finished fourth in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"On the Hypercar side, it was a tough weekend. After our first podium in FIA WEC here a year ago, we had hoped for much more than ninth place. Unfortunately, we had some bad luck during the race with yellow flags and safety cars. On top of that, the #20 car received a drive-through penalty. Ultimately, we also lacked that final bit of pace needed to achieve a top result. I feel sorry for the #15 crew who were involved in two collisions through no fault of their own. On the other side of the garage, there is great joy over another podium for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Third and fourth places are the result of fantastic team performances. Congratulations to Augusto Farfus, Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin on the podium finish. Our goal now is to deliver a strong season finale in Bahrain with all our cars.\"\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): \"Looking at the Hypercars, it was a disappointing weekend. Ultimately, the #20 car finished ninth. We had some bad luck with the safety car, but that wasn’t the end of the world. Even the winning #35 Alpine had a drive-through penalty. It was all about being in the right place at the right time. Congratulations to the Alpine crew on their first FIA WEC victory. As for us, the #15 car was heavily damaged after Raffaele Marciello’s crash. It seems the car in front of him suddenly slowed down due to technical issues, and he couldn’t avoid the accident. The third and fourth places in the LMGT3 class were achieved thanks to our fantastic teamwork. We didn’t have the best pace, but we did a flawless job.\"\n\nRobin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 9th place): \"A tough weekend. From the first practice session, we didn’t have the pace we had hoped for. We managed to improve, but in the end, we weren’t fast enough. In qualifying, we definitely overperformed with fifth place thanks to a fantastic lap by Sheldon. In the race, we had a bit of bad luck and a drive-through penalty, but we were still in a decent position. However, we couldn’t hold onto it due to our lack of pace.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): \"It’s very unfortunate that we had to end the race this way. I’m curious about the outcome of the investigation into my crash. Overall, it was a tough weekend, and we lacked some pace. Still, after the early contact, we made up ground in the race and could have scored some points, especially since several cars ahead of us had penalties or incidents. Now we’re focusing on the season finale in Bahrain.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd place): \"Given the pace we had this weekend, we didn’t expect to move so far forward in the race but we did an excellent job. We had to overcome a few hurdles, but the team handled them brilliantly. The car was much better in the race than in qualifying. The podium feels very rewarding.\"\n\nTimur Boguslavskiy (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd place): \"We’re very happy with this podium. We weren’t the fastest in the race, but we still earned third place. We were close in Austin, and this time it finally worked out. I’m not entirely satisfied with my own performance, but Augusto and Yasser did an amazing job.\"\n\nYasser Shahin (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd place): \"What a fantastic race result. We really didn’t think we had a chance but a great drive from all three drivers and all the right strategy calls delivered today.\"\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 4th place): \"Third and fourth places are a very good team result. This race marks the end of four extremely busy weeks. A podium in Austin, a podium here, plus wins in Suzuka and Valencia – it’s been an incredibly successful month for the team and for me personally. I’m proud of the entire crew.\""}

Just a few hours remain until an event that promises to deliver some of the most thrilling moments in golf, the first tee-off at the Ryder Cup, eagerly anticipated by golf and sports fans for the past two years. On the legendary Black Course at Bethpage State Park, the 45th edition of the iconic team duel between the best golfers from host nation USA and defending champions Europe will begin on Friday morning. BMW is accompanying the Ryder Cup for the third time as a Worldwide Partner, providing a large courtesy car fleet, unique experiences for customers and fans, and exclusively bringing the unparalleled emotions of the Ryder Cup live into BMW vehicles.\n\nThe opening ceremony on Wednesday evening offered a taste of the three days of competition ahead. Revered for its display of drama, camaraderie, and sportsmanship, the Ryder Cup delivers an electrifying fan experience that is unique across the golf world. A total of 28 matches will be played – four Foursomes and four Fourballs on both Friday and Saturday, twelve singles matches on Sunday. Team Europe, led by captain Luke Donald (ENG), needs only a tie (14 points) to retain the trophy. Keegan Bradley’s U.S. team requires at least 14.5 points but has the home advantage on its side. The last away victory was achieved in 2012 when Europe produced the ‘Miracle of Medinah’ in Chicago.\n\nA fleet of more than 200 BMWs will provide premium shuttle service for players, guests, and event officials throughout the week. Like BMW customers in many countries*, they all enjoy the exclusive opportunity to follow the Ryder Cup live in their vehicles. In the U.S., the stream is provided by NBC, while in other markets, the World Feed is available. Customers can access the service via the video app (DTS AutoStage Video Service Powered by TiVo™) in the infotainment systems of their BMW vehicles. This feature is available in vehicles equipped with BMW Operating System 8.5 in combination with Connected Drive Professional* (not available in the BMW 2 Series Coupé, BMW 3 Series, and BMW 4 Series) as well as in vehicles with BMW Operating System 9 in combination with BMW Digital Premium*.\n\nBMW is also offering its customers and guests an exclusive golfing experience at the event itself. The BMW House, with its large grandstand directly at the 14th tee, provides a fascinating opportunity to see the players and captains up close, as well as the new all-electric BMW iX3. This first model of the Neue Klasse made its world premiere just a few weeks ago in Munich and is now on display at Bethpage Black on the BMW grandstand. The Neue Klasse is far more than a new BMW model. It represents the redefinition of the BMW and heralds the start of a new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure. The new BMW iX3 showcases for the first time the major technological the leap forward in many areas: electromobility, display and operating concept, digitalisation, networking, design, and sustainability. All future BMW models will benefit from the innovations in the Neue Klasse – regardless of their drive technology.\n\nFans of golf and the Ultimate Driving Machine will also get a firsthand look at BMW innovation and design through interactive brand displays across Bethpage Black including dueling BMW 7 Series models custom ordered by American captain Keegan Bradley and European captain Luke Donald. In between the action on the fairways and greens, guests will be encouraged to showcase their own skills by joining BMW for a unique driving range challenge near the main entrance. Winners will walk away with BMW ball markers, same-day hospitality upgrades, and even an all-expenses-paid golf getaway to Sea Island Resort in Georgia if they’re able to hit the 150-yard target.\n\nAnother Ryder Cup hotspot can be found in the heart of Manhattan at the world-famous Rockefeller Center. The ‘Ryder Cup Live Fan Zone’ is the place for public viewing, golf challenges, food, drinks, and communal celebrations.

Contemporary Istanbul, Türkiye’s leading international art fair, will celebrate its 20th edition from 24–28 September 2025 at Tersane Istanbul. The 2025 edition reflects two decades of growth for the fair, which has become a vital meeting point for collectors, artists, and institutions from across the region and beyond. This year’s fair programme includes a curated selection of galleries from around the world and landmark institutional collaborations. As part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, the very first BMW Art Car, designed by Alexander Calder, and the latest addition to the collection by Julie Mehretu #20 will be exhibited on the ground.\n\nContemporary Istanbul takes its place on the global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enriched by a vibrant array of events. With Istanbul now joining the ranks of world capitals and premier cultural gatherings, the city cements its status as a vital hub in the international art landscape. The exhibited Art Cars will be shown side by side for the first time in Türkiye at the BMW Lounge in the partner section of Contemporary Istanbul and reflect the breadth and diversity of the BMW Art Car Collection. A dedicated BMW Art Talk as part of the fair’s CIF Dialogues featuring Head of BMW Group Cultural Engagement Thomas Girst will dive deep into the history and individual anecdotes of the 20 rolling sculptures.\n\nAlexander Calder’s BMW 3.0 CSL laid the foundation for the iconic series when French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, together with then BMW Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, asked his artist friend Calder to paint a car. The completely reimagined 3.0 CSL patterned in red, yellow, blue, and white went on to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975 and became a crowd favorite. Alexander Calder (1898-1976) was an American sculptor and artist and is regarded as one of the most influential exponents of Classical Modernism. He began his career as an engineer before turning to art. His most famous works are his mobiles – light, free-moving sculptures that are set in motion by air currents or electric motors – and his static, often-monumental metal sculptures known as \"stabiles\".\n\nThe Ethiopian born, New York based abstract painter Julie Mehretu created the latest and 20th car in the collection from a BMW M Hybrid V8 in 2024 where it premiered at the Centre Pompidou in Paris and hit the racetrack at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Space, movement, and energy have always been central motifs in Mehretu's work. For her Art Car design she transformed a two-dimensional image into a three-dimensional representation, with which she succeeded in bringing dynamism into form. Mehretu used the color and form vocabulary of her monumental painting “Everywhen” (2021-2023) as a starting point for her design.

BMW M Team RLL narrowly missed out on another podium in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship despite a strong performance. In the six-hour race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (USA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) staged an impressive comeback in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8, climbing from seventh on the grid up to second place. Shortly before the end of the race, however, van der Linde was forced to save fuel, dropping the duo back to sixth.\n\nTheir teammates Philipp Eng (AUT) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 were set back early on by a drive-through penalty. In a turbulent race with numerous full course yellow periods, they still managed to collect important championship points by finishing fourth.\n\nThere was plenty to celebrate at Paul Miller Racing. Max Hesse (GER) and Dan Harper (GBR) took the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from pole position to the podium in the GTD-PRO class. Harper had been unbeatable in qualifying, securing his first-ever pole award in the GTD-PRO category. On Sunday, Harper and Hesse fought for victory for a long time before eventually celebrating their third podium of the season with a strong third place finish.\n\nTheir teammates Neil Verhagen, Madison Snow and Connor De Phillippi (all USA) also showed strong pace in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO after starting from ninth. At the three-hour mark, they were even leading the GTD-PRO class ahead of the sister car, collecting important Endurance Cup points. After six hours, the local favourites crossed the line in eighth place in class.\n\nTurner Motorsport also delivered a strong performance in the GTD category, moving up from 14th on the grid. Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher and Jake Walker (all USA) narrowly missed the podium, finishing fourth in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nQuotes after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “After the 1-2 finish at Road America, we once again showed strong performance here in Indianapolis with the BMW M Hybrid V8. Unfortunately, the impressive comeback by Marco and Sheldon was not rewarded with the podium they deserved. The fourth place for Dries and Philipp is a good result, especially considering the penalty, and brings important championship points. Congratulations to Paul Miller Racing on a strong weekend, highlighted by the pole position and the podium finish for the #48. Now we are looking forward to the season finale at Road Atlanta.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “It was not an easy weekend. Our competition, especially Acura and Cadillac, simply had more pace than we did. Still, we had a solid race. The penalty was unfortunate, but race control had announced they would be very strict – and they were for the whole field. Dries did a great job in qualifying and especially at the end. With fourth place we scored important championship points.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 6th place): “Obviously not the result we hoped for in the end. We had the potential to achieve more. The car was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the weekend, which is very positive. We did many things very well this weekend. It’s encouraging to see that we are improving and moving in the right direction but there are also things we need to review. We will do that as a team to come back stronger for Petit Le Mans which is one of the biggest races of the year and one we would all love to win. Hopefully we can finish the year on a high.”\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 3rd place GTD-PRO):\n\n“It was a fantastic weekend. I’m really happy to be back on the podium after a few tough races. In the Endurance Cup we are right back in the title fight. At the three-hour mark we scored maximum points with both cars – and then added more with third place at the end. That puts us in a strong position for the finale at Petit Le Mans. My personal highlight was my first pole position yesterday. It was an amazing feeling, and I think we really deserved it this season. A few times I came very close, and the team always gave me a car capable of it so it was nice to get that one and now let’s move on to the last round.”"}

The BMW Group is launching a vehicle with five different drivetrain technologies. The new BMW X5 will be the first model to offer customers a choice of battery electric, plug-in hybrid, petrol, diesel, and hydrogen fuel cell technology. The HyMoS (Hydrogen Mobility at Scale) initiative is designed to promote the development of hydrogen ecosystems and refueling stations in metropolitan areas and aims for an initial pilot implementation in Germany.\n\n“By launching the new BMW X5 with a choice of five drive system variants, we are once again demonstrating our leading position as a technology pioneer,” says Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development at an BMW event in New York. “Hydrogen has an essential part to play in global decarbonisation, which is why we are committed to driving the technology forward.”\n\nTechnology-open approach is a strategic success factor\n\nProduct diversity continues to be a key success factor for the BMW Group. A wide-ranging portfolio of drive systems – encompassing ICE engines, plug-in hybrids, battery electric drive systems and, starting with the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen in 2028, hydrogen fuel cell technology – lays the foundations for successfully meeting the varying demands and needs of customers worldwide both now and in the future.\n\nFlexible manufacturing structures and high levels of integration expertise enable this array of drive technologies to be implemented efficiently in the new BMW X5 range in terms of development, purchasing and production. This means the BMW model line-up will include two types of fully electric drivetrain (battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell) from 2028, underlining the rigorous application of the brand’s technology-open approach.\n\nThe new BMW iX5 Hydrogen\n\nFollowing successful testing of the pilot fleet worldwide, the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen* will enter the market as the brand’s first-ever series-produced hydrogen-powered model. “The new BMW iX5 Hydrogen will be a true BMW - pioneering in its class and delivering the BMW typical driving pleasure,” says Michael Rath, Vice President Hydrogen Vehicles BMW Group.\n\nThe drive technology is based on the third-generation fuel cell system that the BMW Group is developing in collaboration with the Toyota Motor Corporation.This technological advance paves the way for a system with a more compact design that is also more powerful and efficient, thereby increasing range and output at the same time as reducing energy consumption. The company’s competence centres in Munich and in the BMW Group Plant Steyr are already building first prototypes. Further drive system components will come from the BMW Group plant in Landshut.\n\nBenefits of hydrogen-powered technology\n\nHydrogen is recognized as a promising future energy carrier for global decarbonization. It acts as an effective storage medium for renewable energy sources, helping to balance supply and demand and enabling a more stable and reliable integration of renewables into the energy grid. Hydrogen is the missing piece for completing the electric mobility puzzle where battery electric drive systems are not an optimal solution.\n\nHyMoS initiative: alliance for strengthening the hydrogen infrastructure\n\nAs well as developing the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen, BMW is also actively involved in efforts to expand the hydrogen refueling network. The HyMoS (Hydrogen Mobility at Scale) initiative was established to support hydrogen ecosystems for mobility in cooperation with industry and institutional partners. The aim of this initiative is to increase the economic viability of hydrogen mobility ecosystems by pooling the demand for all types of vehicles, including trucks, buses and passenger cars. This will help to reach an optimal distribution and usage of hydrogen stations. The initiative supports existing hydrogen ecosystem projects in achieving their full potential by sharing experiences across projects and providing ground support of its industry partners. A pilot phase started with the support of existing ecosystems in Germany and France to gather experiences for deployment to further metropolitan areas and a potential later expansion to other countries.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *As this is a development-phase prototype, energy consumption information according to WLTP is not available yet."}

At the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA), BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team experienced just how tough and dramatic endurance racing can be. At the 2025 season finale of the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), the team was only 28 minutes away from securing what would have been BMW’s historic first title in the series. Running second in the race, Markus Reiterberger (GER), Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), and Steven Odendaal (RSA) were on course for the world championship crown with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. But after 23.5 of the 24 hours, a technical issue forced the bike into the pits and out of the race. That left the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team third in the final championship standings. Celebration came, however, from the Superstock Champion-MRP-Tecmas squad who rode the #9 BMW M 1000 RR to the overall podium and victory in the SST class.\n\nThe final 24-hour race could hardly have been more thrilling. Starting from second place on the grid, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team went into the marathon tied on points with YART (Yamaha). After the first set of world championship points was awarded at the eight-hour mark, the BMW factory team moved into the lead and kept it with more points after 16 hours. The #37 machine remained on course for the title until less than half an hour from the checkered flag when retirement struck.\n\nIn the Superstock class, just as at the 8 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), Champion-MRP-Tecmas competed with the #9 BMW M 1000 RR. Just like in Belgium, the team celebrated a class victory – and crowned that with third overall, the first Superstock team to claim an overall podium since 2021. Riders Loris Cresson (FRA), Bálint Kovacs (HUN), Jan-Ole Jähnig (GER), and Hannes Soomer (EST) shared riding duties. The team also secured third place in the FIM Endurance World Cup standings for Superstock bikes.\n\nThe Japanese AutoRace Ube Racing Team made its Bol d’Or debut with the #76 BMW M 1000 RR. Naomichi Uramoto (JPN), Loris Baz (FRA), and Leandro Mercado (ARG) were running a strong fourth place until late in the race when they too had to retire due to a technical issue.\n\nReactions after the season finale at Le Castellet:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Of course, it is very bitter when a possible world championship title slips away so shortly before the finish. Just 28 minutes separated us from this historic success. But that is endurance racing: nothing is decided until the checkered flag falls. The riders and the team gave everything to keep the dream alive, but fate had other plans. Congratulations to YART on winning the title. Once the initial disappointment fades, we can be proud of what the team achieved this season. Everyone delivered outstanding performances in all four races. My thanks go to everyone in the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, to Team Manager Werner Daemen and our riders, as well as all the colleagues in Munich and Berlin who worked so hard for this dream. Next year we want to make it a reality – that’s a promise! The performance of the AutoRace Ube Racing Team was also impressive; in their Bol d’Or debut they held fourth place for a long time. Congratulations to the Champion-MRP-Tecmas Team. Third place overall and victory in the Superstock class is an outstanding achievement and once again highlights the strength of the BMW M 1000 RR in all its specifications.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “My summary of the Bol d’Or: first and foremost, it was an incredible motorsport festival. We’ll be back! What clearly prevails is the joy of seeing the potential of the bike and the team, and of experiencing the tremendous support from everyone – from headquarters in Munich and Berlin, from the race team, all partners, suppliers, and sponsors here on site. Twenty-four hours is always a challenge with maximum performance and concentration under all conditions. The way the team demonstrated this was exemplary – each and every one here, with the riders leading the way. Therefore, my thanks go to all involved. We can only apologise for the technical failure. But BMW will be back, and together we will fight for the world championship next year. And I am very pleased that – despite all the bad luck with the #37 – the #9 BMW M 1000 RR claimed a convincing victory in the Stock class and reached the overall podium.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I have no words to explain my feelings. I am really, really disappointed. And I think this is normal if you fight like me 20 years for this and then such things happen. It breaks my heart, especially for the team. But next year we will do it better. Next year we go for the world championship!”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “Well, basically everything fell under control and we managed everything really well, the engine and the pace for the second part of the race. So it was there for us to take. We did everything right to go and get the second place in the race and most importantly to get the World Championship. But it wasn’t to be. But it’s endurance. Endurance is sometimes cruel. It was an extremely tough race. I think we all gave a lot. And we all feel now like we’re going home empty-handed. But like I said, it’s what it is. Now we have a bit of time, we’ll reflect, take the good bits and come back stronger.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “We managed to be fighting for the title in the final race. We did everything we could to make it happen. We were well on our way, matched on points with YART in qualifying, and by the eight-hour mark of the race we had already built up a points lead. That put us first in the world championship standings. We were then leading the standings. Second place in the race would have been enough for us to secure the title. We just wanted to bring it home – and then, so close to the end, the unthinkable happened. And yes, it just feels like a bad dream. I don’t think you can have worse luck than that. Honestly, I don’t even know what to say. But I am grateful to the whole team and everyone involved, because everyone gave their maximum. No one deserved an outcome like this. Above all, it was hard to stand on the podium afterwards. I think it will take some time before one can really come to terms with something like this.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The team did a really good job. We all gave our 100%. Being tied with the championship lead after qualifying was a great way to start the last race of the year. But unfortunately life sometimes doesn’t work out the way you want it and it’s not the end of the world. We gave it our best shot and unfortunately we had a mechanical failure. But this is racing and there’s always another year, another time, another championship. So I just wanted to say thanks to the team for the great effort that they put in and hopefully we can try and do something in the future.”\n\nFinal World Championship standings (R04/04).\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nYou can find all result from the Bol d’Or at the following link: ITS-Results.com"}

Charles Weerts (BEL) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) have won the drivers’ title in the Sprint Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe. At the Valencia (ESP) season finale, the Team WRT duo in the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO triumphed on Sunday and, after a real nail-biting showdown, claimed the Sprint crown. Team WRT also defended the team title in the Sprint Cup.\n\nWeerts and van der Linde had gone into the last of the five Sprint weekends of the GT World Challenge Europe with a 1.5-point lead. However, in Saturday’s race the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO was hit by a competitor right at the start and had to retire shortly afterwards. That closed the standings even further, with four teams entering the decisive race within just 4.5 points of each other.\n\nOn Sunday, the Belgian-South African duo struck back impressively when van der Linde secured fourth place on the grid in qualifying. With an outstanding stint, the South African fought his way past the competition and handed over the car in the lead to Weerts at the pit stop. Despite intense pressure from behind, the Belgian kept his cool, brought home the second win of the season after a true thriller, and sealed the overall Sprint Cup title.\n\nTeam WRT also successfully defended the team title in the Sprint Cup. For Weerts, it was already his fourth Sprint Cup title in GT World Challenge Europe after 2020, 2021 and 2022. For van der Linde, it marked his first overall victory in GT World Challenge Europe.\n\nTheir teammates Gilles Stadsbader and Matisse Lismont (both BEL) also had reason to celebrate. On Saturday, they triumphed in the Silver Class with the #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, and on Sunday they added a third place in class to secure a double podium finish at Circuit Ricardo Tormo. Maxime Oosten and Mex Jansen (both NED) from Team Paradine Competition also enjoyed two Silver Class podiums: third on Saturday followed by second on Sunday. On Sunday, BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) from AlManar Racing by WRT also finished second in the Gold Cup with the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nComments after the race.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What an incredible weekend! Congratulations to Charles Weerts, Kelvin van der Linde and Team WRT on winning the overall Sprint Cup title. After a difficult Saturday, our drivers kept their nerve in a real thriller on Sunday and delivered a fantastic race. I am very happy that they earned the well-deserved reward for a strong season. I’m also delighted about the #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO victory in the Silver Class on Saturday and the additional podiums by Team WRT and Paradine Competition, who also delivered an impressive weekend. Many thanks to everyone involved.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal WRT): “This weekend was an incredible rollercoaster. From the frustration after qualifying and Saturday’s race to the comeback and triumph on Sunday – it just feels fantastic. It was an outstanding team effort. Once again, the team in the pit lane showed how good they are, securing the fastest pit stop overall, and on top of that winning the Pit Stop Challenge championship, is just brilliant. This is our first title with BMW, and we are very proud of it. A huge thank you to everyone! This trophy is well-deserved by the entire team. Now the focus shifts to the FIA WEC race at Fuji!”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Sprint Cup Champion 2025): “Overall it was quite a difficult weekend for us. Saturday in particular was tough. We struggled in qualifying, and then had a pretty big hit in the very first lap. I had quite a bit of pain all day and night, which meant I couldn’t recover properly. But Kelvin put in an outstanding qualifying today and his race left me speechless – it was unbelievable. The whole team once again did a fantastic job in the pit stop. After that, I just tried to bring the car home. It was tough going beyond the pain, but of course you do it for a championship. We deserved this, we made no mistakes. Thanks to the team, BMW M Motorsport and Kelvin for this incredible season.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Sprint Cup Champion 2025): “It was a very dramatic final weekend, almost as expected, with a brutal low on Saturday and an incredible high on Sunday. Charles and I grew a lot as a team this year. At the beginning of the season, he helped me a lot in getting used to the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and was very open in helping me to be fast. I am very grateful for that, and it really helped us achieve this result. Over the season, Team WRT won us this championship with their pit stops. Sprint races are hugely influenced by pit stops, and on the weekends when we weren’t the strongest on track, we were incredibly fast in the pits and made the difference there. So, a big thank you to the team.”"}

Late summer weather and the accompanying warm temperatures are not necessarily the preferred conditions for many runners, but it did add to the enjoyment of the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON for the roughly one million people lining the route through the German capital. Despite temperatures reaching up to 25 degrees Celsius, the elite athletes once again delivered outstanding performances on one of the fastest marathon courses in the world. Leading the way was Kenyan Sabastian Sawe, who won with the world leading time of 2:02:16 hours, leaving Akira Akasaki (JPN, 2:06:15) and Chimdessa Debele (ETH, 2:06:57) in second and third place.

On behalf of BMW, I would also like to congratulate all the participants on the magnificent achievement of completing this distance,” said Christian Ach, Head of BMW Deutschland. “I am sure that everyone will head home with many positive emotions and memories of this fantastic sporting event, along with their finishers’ medals.”\n\nAnother endurance specialist was out on the route during the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON, which is one of the seven most prestigious marathons in the world, the World Marathon Majors as the new all-electric BMW iX3 50 xDrive accompanied the field as the lead vehicle. The first model in the Neue Klasse heralds the dawn of a new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure. It showcases a huge leap forward in terms of electromobility, display and operating concept, digitalisation, connectivity, design, and sustainability. With a range of up to 805 kilometres (WLTP) and a maximum charging rate of 400 kW– enabling an additional 372 km (231 miles) of range (WLTP) in just 10 minutes of charging – the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive sets new standards for efficiency and long-distance capability.\n\nThe Neue Klasse was by no means the only BMW representative on the streets of Berlin. Roughly 550 BMW Group employees from all over the world lined up at the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON. In total, the company employs more than 150,000 people from 110 countries. For this reason, supporting this diversity in the world of sport is also of great importance to the BMW Group. Sport creates unique moments for athletes and fans, strengthens the sense of community, celebrates diversity and build bridges. The BMW BERLIN-MARATHON does an outstanding job of demonstrating this with participants from 160 nations, handbike and wheelchair competitions, runners with a wide range of personal bests, and the enthusiasm of spectators all along the route.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679-805km."}

This weekend, about 80,000 people from roughly 160 countries – from amateur runners to the very best in the world, and from handbikers to inline skaters – will be getting active on the streets of the German capital, as they make the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON one of the biggest marathon events in the world. It is a festival of running that stands for joy, openness, and friendly intercultural encounters – values that are deeply embedded in the BMW Group's identity. Furthermore, another absolute highlight awaits the roughly one million fans lining the street, as another endurance specialist will also line up at the start on Sunday. The new, all-electric BMW iX3 – the first model in the Neue Klasse – is this year’s lead vehicle.\n\n“It is only fitting that we’ve chosen the 2025 BMW BERLIN-MARATHON to this premiere. There could be no more suitable event for the first ‘race deployment’ of the new BMW iX3, where endurance is everything,” said Christian Ach, Head of BMW Deutschland. “The first model of the Neue Klasse was presented just a few weeks ago at IAA Mobility in Munich, and now it is on the streets of Berlin alongside world-class athletes – great company for an all-electric vehicle with a range of up to 805 kilometres, which can be charged with enough power for up to 372 kilometres of range in just ten minutes.”\n\nThe first model in the Neue Klasse is far more than a new BMW model. It represents the redefinition of the BMW and heralds the start of a new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure.

All future BMW models will benefit from the innovations in the Neue Klasse – regardless of their drive technology.\n\nThe clear, reduced design language of the Neue Klasse is typical BMW and so progressive that it gives the impression it has skipped a complete vehicle generation.\n\nThe sixth generation of eDrive technology sets new standards for efficiency and long-distance capability. Another factor behind these values is the new electronics and software architecture. Four ‘superbrain’ high-performance computers make the first Neue Klasse model more intelligent and more ready for the future than ever. The ‘Heart of Joy’ drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology enables unmatched handling dynamism and precision, while the latest systems for automated driving optimise symbiotic human-vehicle interaction.\n\nThe new BMW Panoramic iDrive takes operation and brand-typical driver focus to a new level.

The BMW Group has entered the final phase before the first Neue Klasse model rolls off the assembly line. Series production of the new BMW iX3 will get underway in late October at the BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary, as the newest, most innovative manufacturing facility in the company’s global production network officially begins work.\n\n“The start of series production for the BMW iX3 signals a new era of automotive manufacturing. Our new plant in Debrecen has been designed and built fully in line with our strategic vision of the iFACTORY. Digital from the very beginning, the plant will offer a new dimension in efficient production without fossil fuels,” says Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production.\n\nThe BMW iFACTORY represents a strategic vision of production, built on streamlined, efficient structures, responsible resource management, economical use of cutting-edge digital innovations and a strong focus on employees. The BMW Group has also registered new patents for a large number of innovative systems and processes at Plant Debrecen.\n\n“We have taken on the challenge of building a completely new vehicle as the first job at an entirely new plant – and doing so in the leanest, most efficient way possible. We have simplified processes, reduced complexity, digitally validated each individual operation and systematically leveraged expertise across our global network. The result is this plant, with its efficient production, innovative processes and the flexibility to integrate additional models,” says Hans-Peter Kemser, head of BMW Group Plant Debrecen.\n\nAs with any new model, capacity for the new BMW iX3 will be gradually ramped up in stages after the start of production. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, the iX3 showcases the latest design and technology innovations that will define the brand's entire model range in the future. Between now and 2027, the technologies in the Neue Klasse will be integrated into 40 new models and model updates.\n\nFrom virtual factory to reality\n\nThe guiding principles of the BMW iFACTORY have been fully implemented in the technologies employed at the new BMW Group plant in Debrecen. For example, Plant Debrecen was planned and built digitally from the outset, and celebrated its virtual start of production back in March 2023 in the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory. This approach allowed every operation to be tested virtually in advance, enabling production lines to be installed in the buildings exactly as in the digital twin.\n\nOptimal processes for all plant technologies\n\nWith an optimised value stream and efficient systems, the press shop guarantees a high level of productivity. The BMW Group continues to follow its proven strategy of using the same tools and presses throughout its global network. This optimises capacity utilisation within the network by allowing press tools to be deployed at multiple locations and enabling staff to be trained in-network.\n\nThe body shop, in particular, benefits from prior digital planning and validation. Every process detail was digitally simulated in advance to determine the ideal value stream and ensure that each of the nearly 1,000 robots was optimally positioned. From the outset, close collaboration between development and production teams led to high production efficiency and maximum customer benefit. For example, the number of joining methods was significantly reduced, lowering overall complexity. Design features integrated early in development are also evident in the details of the Neue Klasse, such as the invisible door seal. This creates a visual connection between the window and the door, resulting in a unique look. In addition, maximising the space available for the battery in the body structure – and thus the size and performance of the battery – directly benefits the customer.\n\nAt BMW Group Plant Debrecen, the paint shop plays a critical role in significantly reducing the CO2e footprint of the BMW iX3. Production of the new BMW iX3 will generate a total of about 80 kg CO₂e (scope 1/2 emissions). This figure covers CO₂e emissions from Plant Debrecen, as well as in-house parts production at other BMW Group facilities, including components manufactured in Landshut, for example. This represents a reduction of approx. two-thirds compared to production of existing BMW derivatives. For Plant Debrecen alone, this approach will reduce CO₂e emissions from the manufacture of a vehicle, including its high-voltage battery, by around 90% – to about 34 kg CO₂e (when operating at full capacity, compared with other BMW Group facilities).\n\nPaint shops typically rely on gas to reach the high temperatures (up to 180 degrees Celsius) required. Plant Debrecen will be the BMW Group's first car plant supplied exclusively with electricity from renewable energy sources during normal operation, i.e. without using fossil fuels such as oil or gas. Because of its high energy demands, the paint shop is the most important factor in significantly lowering Plant Debrecen’s CO2e emissions. In the paint shop alone, using electricity from renewable sources reduces annual CO2e emissions by up to 12,000 tonnes. About a quarter of the plant's annual power needs will be supplied by the 50‑hectare on-site photovoltaic system. Surplus solar energy, such as that generated on non‑working days, is stored in a 1,800 m³ thermal storage system with a capacity of 130 MWh.\n\nThe paint shop also uses an energy recovery system. A heat grid was successfully implemented in the design of the new paint shop, delivering additional energy savings of up to 10%. This innovative concept combines multiple measures for efficient energy recovery from the compressed air supply, drying ovens and cooling systems. The recovered waste heat is then used to preheat the water circuit.\n\nIn addition, a thermal storage system – holding 1,800 m³ of water, with a capacity of 130 MWh – stores surplus energy from the photovoltaic system during off-peak periods and supplies it as heat during peak demand.\n\nFull digitalisation of production processes further boosts assembly efficiency. The AIQX (Artificial Intelligence Quality Next) IT platform developed in-house at the BMW Group is a key component of the BMW iFACTORY. AIQX uses sensors and camera systems along the production line to automate quality processes. AI evaluates the data and provides real-time feedback to employees on the line. Looking ahead, vehicles on the line will also become active, connected participants in the industrial IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystem. They will conduct self-analysis, interact with plant employees in real time and automatically share and document relevant messages, using tools such as on-board cameras and IT systems. The equipment, tools, components and every BMW in the assembly halls are already digitally connected to the BMW production system.\n\nThe building's “finger structure” – an optimised version of the design employed at BMW Group Plant Leipzig – allows 80% of parts to be delivered directly to the correct point of assembly on the line. All-electric in-house logistics also benefit from autonomous tugger trains, which transport high-voltage batteries directly from production to installation points, as well as Smart Transport Robots that autonomously deliver smaller components to the assembly line. By linking all internal and external databases, the entire logistics process achieves unprecedented digital depth, automating many previously manual, interconnected analysis tasks. Well-structured information is therefore available at any time and can be analysed instantly “at the push of a button”.\n\nThe BMW Group has created highly intelligent production processes for its new high-voltage batteries developed in-house. Plant Debrecen will be the first of five plants worldwide to begin series production of Gen6 high-voltage batteries. The production processes were initially developed and tested at pilot plants. Artificial intelligence, data analytics and constant knowledge sharing within the production network also play a key role in the ramp-up of production. Digital twins of production and comprehensive AI databases ensure optimisation of processes and employee training. A consistent zero-defect approach enables seamless in-line quality inspections and 100% end‑of-line monitoring. In line keeping with the “local for local” principle, high‑voltage battery assembly takes place directly on site, allowing the production teams to take advantage of infrastructure efficiencies and short distances.\n\nBest of the best:Plant Debrecen benefits from expertise at all production sites worldwide\n\nBMW Group Plant Debrecen is the first production site in the company's network not tied to a specific primary plant. Instead, it serves as a network plant, combining best practices from various locations worldwide. A major advantage of this approach is that the plant’s current workforce of more than 2,000 employees can be trained within the network, allowing employee know-how from different locations, such as China, South Africa, Mexico, the US and, of course, Germany, to be shared. At the same time, employees throughout the global network gain the opportunity to share their technology insights in Debrecen and bring expertise in production of the Neue Klasse models back to their own location – creating a win-win situation for all the plants.\n\nA long version with further details on all technologies is available as a PDF file in the downloads section.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO₂-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."}

On an exciting final Sunday, during which more than a dozen players had realistic hopes of victory, a playoff was once again required to determine the winner, just like last year. With a birdie on the first extra hole, Alex Noren secured the prestigious BMW PGA Championship title for the second time after his 2017 victory. The 43-year-old Swede triumphed with rounds of 67, 68, 66, and 68, finishing with a total score of 269 strokes (19 under par). Adrien Saddier from France needed five strokes (even par) on the first extra hole and had to settle for second place. Patrick Reed (USA) and Aaron Rai (ENG) shared third place, both finishing at 16 under par. With twelve career victories, Noren is now the most successful Swedish player in the history of the DP World Tour. A record number of 118,421 spectators flocked to the Wentworth Club this week to celebrate the Festival of Golf.\n\n“On behalf of BMW, I would like to congratulate Alex Noren on winning the 2025 BMW PGA Championship. The Festival of Golf lived up to its reputation once again, and Alex’s performance all week played a significant role in it,“ said David George, CEO at BMW Group UK and Ireland. “For more than 20 years, BMW has been a proud title partner to this outstanding golf event. It’s great to experience the sense of joy surrounding the players and fans at the BMW PGA Championship. We are equally proud to support the Golf Foundation through Eagles for Education in their efforts to strengthen mental resilience in pupils and in helping them on their way to a self-determined future.“\n\nDuring the four rounds of the BMW PGA Championship, the world-class field carded a total of 72 eagles. For each of these, the BMW Group is donating £1,000 to the Golf Foundation as part of its Eagles for Education initiative. The total sum of £72,000 will support the Golf Foundation‘s Unleash Your Drive programme, which brings simplified versions of the game of golf to schools across England. Pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged regions and underprivileged families, are taught to remain resilient, focused, and determined in the face of challenges. These skills will help to prepare youngsters for life inside and outside the classroom.\n\nNoren contributed an eagle during his four tournament rounds and owes his triumph primarily to his consistency. He was the only player to record no more than 68 strokes (4 under par) in any round. The European Ryder Cup team's vice-captain showcased his outstanding form, having won the British Masters just three weeks ago. “It’s so many emotions right now. Sometimes it comes easy. Sometimes you’ve just got to fight. Today it felt like a fight,” said Noren. “This tournament is unbelievable, it‘s one of the best tournaments in the world and it gets better every year.“\n\nAt the 2025 BMW PGA Championship, the new all-electric BMW iX3 50 xDrive celebrated its UK premiere as the tournament's Hole-in-One prize. The Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) is the first model of the Neue Klasse and heralds a new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure. However, no player managed to score an ace on the 14th hole this week, which would have been rewarded with the new BMW iX3.\n\nThe eleven players of the European Ryder Cup team, who competed at the Wentworth Club alongside their captain Luke Donald (ENG), departed together for New York on Sunday to prepare for their title defense against Team USA. In addition to Noren, Viktor Hovland (NOR), Tyrrell Hatton, and Matt Fitzpatrick (both ENG, all -15, T5) also carry strong results into the event. The Ryder Cup (September 23–28, 2025, Bethpage Black Course near New York, USA) will feature BMW as a Worldwide Partner for the third time."}

The DTM title race continues to heat up – and Schubert Motorsport is right in the thick of it, along with BMW M works drivers René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER). The highlight of the penultimate race weekend of the season at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) was Saturday's race, where Rast and Wittmann secured a one-two finish with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. In qualifying, Wittmann claimed pole position ahead of Rast. On Sunday, both drivers faced greater challenges, partly due to the success ballast from their one-two finish the day before. Nevertheless, they still have realistic chances of winning the drivers' title at the season finale at Hockenheim (GER). Schubert Motorsport also remains in contention to defend their title in the team standings.\n\nIn the first race, Wittmann and Rast capitalised on the strengths of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Red Bull Ring and dominated the action. Rast took the lead after just a few laps and confidently secured his 31st DTM victory. For Wittmann, it looked like a third-place finish until the final lap, but a spin by Jack Aitken (GBR, Ferrari) ahead of him moved him up to second place.\n\nWith his victory, Rast temporarily took the lead in the drivers' standings but had to relinquish it again on Sunday. Due to the success ballast in his car, he faced significantly more challenges starting from seventh on the grid compared to Saturday but still fought for a top-five result. However, two rule violations during the final pit stop and subsequent \"slow zone\" penalties dropped him back to 13th place. Wittmann finished just ahead of him in 12th. After being hit at the rear at the start and nearly spinning, Wittmann fought his way back strongly from the back of the field.\n\nHeading into the final two races at Hockenheim, Rast sits third in the standings with 160 points, 11 points behind the leader. Wittmann, with 150 points, is seventh and still in the title race. In the team standings, Schubert Motorsport is second with 300 points, trailing the leader by 16 points. The mission to defend the title continues.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Schubert Motorsport on the podium. Schubert Motorsport also had a strong weekend at the Red Bull Ring in the ADAC GT Masters. In Sunday’s race, Sandro and Juliano Holzem (both GER) drove the #56 BMW M4 GT3 EVO to a second-place finish on the podium. The twin brothers had already delivered a strong performance in the first race, narrowly missing the podium with a fourth-place finish. FK Performance Motorsport struggled with its two cars and missed out on top positions. In the ADAC GT4 Germany, no BMW M4 GT4 EVO made it to the podium this time.\n\nComments on the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"What a weekend! Saturday couldn’t have gone better. The one-two finish was exactly what we needed in the tight championship battle. We knew we wouldn’t be able to repeat this fantastic performance on Sunday, but missing out on the top ten was still disappointing. We left some points on the table, but the most important thing is that we head to Hockenheim with realistic title chances. Schubert Motorsport also performed strongly in the ADAC GT Masters. Congratulations to the Holzem brothers for their podium on Sunday and an overall strong team performance. Unfortunately, we couldn’t make it to the podium with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO this time, but we’ll come back fighting at Hockenheim.\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): \"The one-two finish on Saturday was fantastic and exactly what we needed to put ourselves in a strong position for the season finale in the title race. Unfortunately, Sunday turned out to be the tough race we expected. Marco was unlucky with the contact in the first corner but fought his way back well. For René, things were going very well until the second pit stop. It’s frustrating that both he and we as a team received penalties, as that cost René some valuable points. But with 56 points still up for grabs at Hockenheim, our drivers are 11 and 21 points behind, and we as a team are 16 points back. We need to secure as many of those 56 points as possible. I’m also pleased with our performance in the ADAC GT Masters this weekend. The podium is a nice reward for the team.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 1st place, R2: 13th place): \"All in all, it was a good weekend. We celebrated a one-two finish on Saturday and closed the gap to the top of the standings. Unfortunately, we lost some points on Sunday due to the two penalties, which dampens the overall impression a bit. But the important thing is that we still have everything to play for at Hockenheim.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 2nd place, R2: 12th place): \"I leave the Red Bull Ring with mixed feelings. My crew and I did a perfect job in both races and made great improvements, especially from Friday to Saturday. Pole position was the perfect reward for that. The one-two finish in the race was fantastic for the team, even though I would have loved to win from pole. On Sunday, after the incident at the start, we were at the back of the field but never gave up and did the best possible damage control. It’s a shame we left some points behind, but the last four races have shown how quickly things can change in this DTM season. If my crew and I work together as brilliantly as we did here, everything is still possible at Hockenheim.\""}

At times, they were even in contention for a podium spot. After a turbulent final hour, the #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO crossed the line in fifth overall but were classified sixth (fifth in the PRO class) due to a post-race time penalty.\n\nIt was also a strong performance from BMW M works driver Neil Verhagen (USA) and his teammates Maxime Oosten (NED) and Ruan Cunfan (CHN) in the #89 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Team KRC. Their race went only one way, namely forward. The trio ultimately had double reason to celebrate. The #89 finished a strong ninth overall, taking second place in the IGTC Bronze class while also securing victory in the GT World Challenge Asia classification.\n\nIn the IGTC manufacturers’ standings, points leader BMW extended its lead to 18 points with the Suzuka victory (127 vs 109). In the drivers’ standings, four BMW M works drivers now sit at the top: van der Linde leads with 85 points ahead of Marciello (80), Farfus (72), and Weerts (53). The season finale of the Intercontinental GT Challenge 2025, the Indianapolis 8 Hour (USA), will take place from 16th to 18th October. There, BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT will once again compete together.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What a fantastic performance at Suzuka! Congratulations to Team WRT, to Kevin, Raffaele, and Charles on this outstanding victory. Pole position and then such a dominant race performance; with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO they were in a class of their own. It was fantastic for BMW M Motorsport to be back on the top step after the double success at Bathurst and win at the 24h Nürburgring. Augusto, Max, and Dan also put in a strong performance in the #31. Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite enough for a podium in the end, but they fought hard and delivered a flawless race. Overall, we can be very satisfied given that at the Indianapolis finale we have a strong chance of winning the title in both championships. Congratulations also to our Chinese customers Team KRC. To take ninth overall in such a competitive field and secure a class podium was a fantastic achievement.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, Team WRT): “What a great feeling winning this important IGTC race! The last time we were here we won the race also! We had a strong car from the start until the end but you never know what can happen! We’ve been a little bit under pressure at some point as I think the Porsche had a better strategy than us. Luckily we could come back and win the race. This win is super important for us, for BMW M Motorsport and for the championship. Onto the next one!”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 1st place overall & PRO class): “It’s great to be back here with Team WRT. The team has been amazing all week. The car was flawless and we made no mistakes so we managed to bring the win home! I’m super proud of everyone!”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 1st place overall & PRO class): “I’m super happy. It’s a very nice race to win! I won it in 2018, then I was on the podium with Kelvin in 2019 and now we are back together on the top spot. It was an amazing race, the car was amazing and my teammates did an amazing job! It was a nice reward for our work. Thanks to Team WRT and to BMW M Motorsport!”\n\nCharles Weerts (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 1st place overall & PRO class): “I’m extremely happy! It was my first time and first race in Japan! To be able to score the pole position and the win is a perfect race. It’s a dream! Huge thanks to my teammates for the great job, to WRT and to BMW M Motorsport for giving us such a competitive car! On to many more!”\n\nDan Harper (Team WRT, #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 6th place overall, 5th place PRO class): “It was a very warm and humid race! It’s super great that the sister car got the victory. They’ve been flying all weekend long. It’s fully deserved: pole and leading the whole race. It’s great for BMW for the Manufacturers championship which was the main aim this weekend. It has been a shame for us in the #31 but we did not have the pace that the #32 had. We were fighting hard to stay in the top five. We still got good points for BMW. It was super nice to be back with Team WRT and great to join the celebrations with the sister car.”\n\nNeil Verhagen (Team KRC, #89 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place Bronze class): “A great result for Team KRC. Thanks to them and BMW M Motorsport for the opportunity. I think in the end P2 was the best we could do. We didn’t quite have the pace for the class win. That’s a bit unfortunate, but we gave it everything and I’m very happy with the result and proud for the hard work of the team. It makes for a great week. It was my first time at Suzuka and the circuit is defintely one of my favourites. The fans were incredible and the whole event was awesome.”"}

The BMW Group congratulates the Preis der Nationalgalerie on its 25th anniversary. Since its establishment in 2000, the award has recognised artistic positions that significantly shape contemporary art and has presented them to a wide audience in Berlin. BMW has been the exclusive partner of this unique initiative since 2006. To mark the anniversary year, BMW is bringing another highlight to Berlin: as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, the 19th BMW Art Car, designed by John Baldessari, is displayed on the terrace of the Neue Nationalgalerie. With this world tour, BMW is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Cars this year and next. Back in 2021, BMW, together with the Calder Foundation, showcased the \"Artist’s Proof\" of the first BMW Art Car by Alexander Calder on the same terrace.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie will remain adaptable in the future and will continue in a new format at the Neue Nationalgalerie from 2026. From then on, solo exhibitions will honour artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively shown in Berlin. With the change of venue, contemporary art will engage in dialogue with the collection and history of the Neue Nationalgalerie. The iconic upper hall of the Mies van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a powerful artistic statement. This is made possible by a dedicated budget funded by the Freunde der Nationalgalerie and BMW.\n\n\"The Preis der Nationalgalerie was established at a time when contemporary art in Berlin received significantly less support. Today, Berlin is one of the most important centres for the production and presentation of contemporary art. With the move to the Neue Nationalgalerie, we aim to showcase artists whose work has shaped Berlin and who also possess international appeal. The goal is to place their works in dialogue with the architecture of the Mies van der Rohe building, thereby creating a connection between the collection, art history, and contemporary art,\" says Klaus Biesenbach, Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie.\n\n\"We are very proud that the Preis der Nationalgalerie has developed over the past 25 years into one of the most important art awards, and that all its laureates have been able to provide key impulses with their work, both nationally and internationally. The award has always been distinguished by its ability to respond positively to changes in the interests of the museum, the artists, and the audience. This has not only maintained but increased its relevance over the decades. We look forward to the next stage of its development,\" says Christian Kohorst, Chairman of the Freunde der Nationalgalerie.\n\nThe prize winner will be announced at the end of October 2025. The exhibition will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week. Further information about the Preis der Nationalgalerie is available here.\n\nThe expert jury for the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie consists of international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris), Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Riehen), and Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). Eligible to nominate were not only the jury members but also the curators of the Nationalgalerie as well as the members of the Freunde der Nationalgalerie.\n\n\"The internationally renowned Preis der Nationalgalerie has, for 25 years, demonstrated how art can shape social debates and open up new perspectives. It stands for innovation, creativity, and cultural diversity – values that are deeply rooted in the BMW Group. Together with our partners, we are delighted that art can unfold its impact far beyond the museum space,\" says Alexander Bilgeri, Vice President Corporate Communications. BMW Group.\n\nThe presentation of John Baldessari's 19th BMW Art Car on the terrace of the Neue Nationalgalerie is part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary collection. With this largest exhibition project in the history of the BMW Art Cars, all 20 vehicles will be shown worldwide in leading museums and institutions. The series, which began in 1975 with Alexander Calder, continues to unite outstanding artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jenny Holzer, David Hockney, Jeff Koons, Esther Mahlangu, Olafur Eliasson, Cao Fei, and Julie Mehretu. For five decades, the BMW Art Cars have combined art and design, technology and innovation, motorsport and engineering – embodying the essence of the BMW Group's global cultural engagement, which includes over 100 initiatives in contemporary art, music, film, and design.\n\nThe BMW Art Car designed by John Baldessari (1931–2020) is considered one of the most distinctive works in the series. Known for his coloured dots and shapes, the Californian artist aimed to create a \"typical Baldessari\" and simultaneously crafted an icon of motorsport. A large red dot on the roof ensures perfect visibility on the track. The word \"FAST\" on the driver's side serves as an energetic reminder of the essence of racing. On the passenger side, the vehicle itself is depicted – a tribute to the designers. This minimalist vehicle was the first Art Car to compete in a race without sponsor logos and the third – after Roy Lichtenstein (1977) and Andy Warhol (1979) – to successfully cross the finish line of a 24-hour race.\n\nIn 2021, BMW, together with the Calder Foundation, presented the \"Artist’s Proof\" of the first BMW Art Car by Alexander Calder on the terrace of the Neue Nationalgalerie. The occasion was the opening of the exhibition \"Alexander Calder: Minimal / Maximal,\" which marked the museum's reopening after extensive renovations. With the presentations of Calder and now Baldessari, BMW bridges the origins of the Art Car history to the present. Further information about the presentation of the Artist’s Proof is available here.\n\nIn addition to the Preis der Nationalgalerie, the BMW Group's long-term commitments in the capital include the Gallery Weekend Berlin, which celebrated its 21st edition in May 2025. Alongside its extensive engagement in the visual arts, BMW also collaborates with the Staatsoper Unter den Linden and annually invites audiences to the traditional open-air format \"State Opera for All\" on Bebelplatz.\n\nThe BMW Group's cultural engagement, including exclusive updates and deeper insights into its worldwide cultural initiatives, can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}

Just a few days ago, the new BMW iX3 celebrated its world premiere in Munich, and this week, the all-electric Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) is making its debut in the United Kingdom at the BMW PGA Championship. As the flagship event of the DP World Tour, it is a highlight of the British sporting calendar and the perfect stage for the first Neue Klasse model. One player from the world-class field at Wentworth could even be among the first to experience a new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure on the road as the first ace on the 14th hole (Par 3) at the Wentworth Club will be rewarded with a new BMW iX3 50 xDrive.\n\nThe Neue Klasse is not just a new car. It represents the redefinition of the BMW brand and is the logical dawn of a new era for the BMW Group. The new BMW iX3 also marks a huge leap forward in terms of electromobility, display and operating concept, digitalisation, connectivity, design, and sustainability. The whole product range will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue Klasse – whichever drive system technology is employed.\n\nThe fully electric BMW eDrive technology of the 6th generation drive system with 800V technology and cylindrical battery cells with 20% higher energy density achieves a range of up to 805 km (500 miles, WLTP). A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables an additional 372 km (231 miles) of range (WLTP) in just 10 minutes of charging.\n\nThe “Heart of Joy” drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology enables unmatched handling dynamism and precision, while the latest systems for automated driving optimise symbiotic human-vehicle interaction. The new BMW Panoramic iDrive elevates operation and driver focus for which the brand is renowned to a new level. With its balanced combination between digital functions and physical elements, the revolutionary display and control/operation concept facilitates intuitive operation according to BMW’s fabled “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” principle.\n\nVisitors to the BMW PGA Championship can experience the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive not only at the 14th tee but also as a display vehicle in the Championship Village. Should a pro achieve the dream shot on the 14th hole, it would mark the seventh time in tournament history that a special prize is awarded.\n\nIn 2015 (Andrew Johnston, ENG, BMW M4 Coupé, and Chris Wood, ENG, BMW i8) and 2016 (Scott Jamieson, SCO, BMW M2 Coupé, and James Morrison, ENG, BMW i8 Protonic Red Edition), there were two Hole-in-One Prizes each year which found happy owners. In 2020, David Howell holed out on the 14th hole with a single stroke. That year, the tournament was held during the Covid-19 pandemic, and BMW donated the equivalent value of the 530e xDrive Touring – £71,675 – to the Alzheimer’s Society. The Albatross Award offered in 2020 on the 18th hole, a BMW i8 Roadster Rosso Corsa, was claimed by Ross Fisher with a spectacular shot. To this day, the Englishman’s albatross on the iconic finishing hole of the West Course remains the only one in the tournament’s long history.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679-805km."}

From today until Sunday, a world-class field will compete at the flagship event of the DP World Tour for one of Europe’s most prestigious titles. On the road to victory at the BMW PGA Championship, every eagle is particularly valuable – defending champion Billy Horschel (USA), for example, defeated Rory McIlroy in a playoff at the 18th hole in 2024 with an eagle. But beyond the sporting outcome, eagles have a significant impact. As in the previous year, the BMW Group is supporting the Golf Foundation through its Eagles for Education initiative by donating £1,000 per eagle scored, thereby contributing to the Unleash Your Drive programme.\n\nUnleash Your Drive brings simplified versions of golf to schools across England, aiming to strengthen mental toughness. Pupils are taught to remain resilient, focused, and determined in the face of challenges, setbacks, and pressure, while maintaining a positive and determined mindset. These skills, which can be ideally practiced through golf, will help to prepare youngsters for life inside and outside the classroom.\n\nThe goals of the programme align perfectly with those of the Eagles for Education initiative, through which the BMW Group fulfils its social responsibility at international BMW golf tournaments. Together with local organisations, it advocates for education and equal opportunities for young people facing challenging starting conditions.\n\nThe collaboration with the Golf Foundation started last year. At the 2024 BMW PGA Championship, pros scored a total of 89 eagles. Winkfield St Mary’s School in Bracknell was one of the many schools who benefitted from the BMW Group’s donation of £89,000. As another week of Eagles for Education began on Monday, Nick Dougherty, former professional golfer, winner of the 2009 BMW International Open, and President of the Golf Foundation, joined a session with the youngsters and caught up with the teachers who have seen the impact on the ground. He also invited the children to the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth Club.\n\nAs the Golf Foundation is also the Official Tournament Charity this year, visitors can contribute to the good cause as well. Alongside Eagles for Education, this year will see the Golf Foundation run the Mega Putt as well as chipping and simulator challenges across the Championship Village in order to raise vital funds. Every £10 raised gets another pupil on the Unleash Your Drive programme, which sees six weeks of golf delivered that focuses on vital mental toughness tools.\n\nThrough its Eagles for Education initiative, the BMW Group is also involved in the BMW International Open (Germany) in support of the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. As part of the global amateur tournament series BMW Golf Cup, the Eagles for Education initiative supports JOBLINGE in Germany and UNICEF at the World Final. All proceeds from the BMW Championship (USA) benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation, which awards full tuition and housing college scholarships for deserving caddies."}

A special highlight is the incredible season that Random Vandals Racing is delivering in both the GT3 and GT4 categories. Turner Motorsport is also impressing across multiple series. I am also very pleased about the victory for FK Performance Motorsport in the prestigious ADAC GT Masters. Beyond that, there were many more BMW M Motorsport customers who were able to celebrate successes in this decisive stage of the season. I am delighted for each and every one of them and send my heartfelt congratulations. Now it’s about reaping the well-deserved rewards in the form of titles.”\n\nNLS: BMW M2 Racing to get its own cup class in its debut season.\n\nRight in its debut season in 2026, the BMW M2 Racing will conquer the \"Green Hell\". The new entry-level race car from BMW M Motorsport will receive its own cup class as part of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS). This places the car in the footsteps of its predecessors, the BMW M235i Racing, BMW M240i Racing, and BMW M2 CS Racing. The BMW M2 Racing has already passed its first test races on the Nordschleife, including the 24-hour race, with flying colours. Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, stated: \"With the BMW M2 Racing, we are continuing a proud tradition. Like its predecessors, it will redefine the entry-level segment. It is affordable, powerful, easy to maintain, and cost-efficient, with the typical M precision and drivability – ideal conditions for its own cup class on the Nordschleife.\" VLN Managing Director Mike Jäger added: \"We are delighted that there will once again be a cup class for the BMW M2 Racing in 2026. BMW cup cars have provided thrilling racing in the past. In 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2024, they produced the champions of our series.\" The NLS will kick off its 50th season on 14th March 2026.\n\nADAC GT Masters (5th-7th September): Zimmermann and Fourie win at the Salzburgring.\n\nAt the fourth round of the ADAC GT Masters at the Salzburgring (AUT), BMW M Motorsport triumphed. Title contenders Tim Zimmermann (GER) and Leyton Fourie (RSA) won the Sunday race after Fourie had put the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO on pole position. “My qualifying lap was one of the best I’ve ever driven,” said Fourie on Sunday. “From that moment, we knew we had a clear track, a good car for the race, and just needed to execute properly.” With their second win of the season, the German-South African duo from FK Performance Motorsport closed to within eight points of the championship lead. On Saturday, Sandro and Juliano Holzem (both GER) took third place in the #56 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Schubert Motorsport. On Sunday they narrowly missed the podium, finishing fourth.\n\nGT World Challenge America (5th-7th September): BMW M4 GT3 EVO triumphs again at Barber Motorsports Park.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT3 EVO’s winning streak in GT World Challenge America continued at Barber Motorsports Park. Championship leaders Kenton Koch and Connor De Phillippi (both USA) celebrated their next victory in the #99 Random Vandals Racing car, winning Saturday’s race.

At Barber Motorsports Park, the young American scored his sixth win of the season. After finishing fourth on Saturday, Rothberg was unbeatable in Sunday’s race. With his latest victory, he further extended his championship lead. “The car felt really good,” Rothberg said afterward. “We had some understeer issues on Saturday, and the Turner guys took care of it completely. I just had to focus and do my job. I’m getting better at telling the team what I need from the car, but it really helps having Robby (Foley) here. He knows this BMW inside and out. I’m getting closer. I just try to keep learning from him.”\n\nGT4 America (5th-7th September): Full program, full success for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO.\n\nIt was a packed weekend for GT4 America teams at Barber Motorsports Park (USA) – and once again a complete success for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO.

The big weekend winners were Ryder Quinn and Steve Jakic (both AUS). Although competing in the Silver-Am category rather than the top class, the duo clinched an outright win in the second race with the #3 BMW M4 GT4 of Thunder Buddies / TekworkX, thanks in large part to Quinn’s impressive comeback drive in the second half. It was their first overall victory in GT4 Australia.

For the launch of the new BMW iX3, BMW and its lead agency Jung von Matt Hamburg are presenting an international campaign that marks the start of a new era. The claim “The first of a new era” serves to position the BMW iX3 as the first model based on the future-forward Neue Klasse platform. This new chapter in the history of BMW puts the focus on electric mobility, digitalisation and sustainability while exploring new facets of the Sheer Driving Pleasure that has always been a key part of the BMW brand DNA.\n\nThe Neue Klasse: BMW enters a new era of driving pleasure with the iX3.“It was the first Neue Klasse, in the 1960s, which laid the foundations for the global success of BMW. Today’s Neue Klasse takes us into a whole new era, which starts with the BMW iX3 as the first model from this new vehicle generation. It stands for electric mobility without range anxiety and for a digital experience that uses intelligent solutions to put our customers at the centre. Moreover, it stands for sustainable production committed to responsible action. But most of all, it starts a new chapter for driving pleasure. The Neue Klasse goes along with a new era in marketing – an era fully focused on our customers. They can now experience a highly advanced configurator as well as innovative services that are more intuitive and personal than ever before. Our brand film illustrates this sense of a new beginning – while demonstrating that the Neue Klasse is more than a vehicle: it is a promise to shape the future of BMW,” explains Bernd Körber, Head of Product & Brand Management for BMW.\n\nAndreas Ernst, Managing Director at Jung von Matt Hamburg, adds: “The automotive market is undergoing the most sweeping change in its history. For a brand like BMW that tends to be ahead of its competitors, innovation is key. But to set itself apart on the global stage in the long term, every brand needs a relevant promise that speaks to emotions – and that is something BMW has more of than any other car brand. BMW literally invented driving pleasure. Its Neue Klasse now transports it into a new era.”\n\nOptimised content for all international channels and touchpoints.The focal point of the campaign is a brand film, which, following the premiere of the BMW iX3 at the IAA Mobility 2025 (9 to 14 September 2025), will be used in all global markets – on TV as well as the brand’s digital channels.\n\nThe film recalls the unique history of BMW using legendary models such as the BMW 1800, the BMW M1, the BMW 3 Series, the BMW X5 and the electrified BMW i8. These vehicles are literally “coming home” to the BMW Headquarters so they can witness the birth of the new BMW iX3. As a new milestone, this vehicle provides a bridge between a past steeped in tradition and an electric, digital and sustainable future. The film was produced by Tempomedia.\n\nIt is accompanied by ten product short films, one product launch film, and content optimised for social media. Illustrating the hallmark BMW driving enjoyment for the digital age, these can be deployed globally.\n\nIn parallel with the campaign, BMW is introducing additional changes. The brand design has been refreshed in collaboration with BECC Agency GmbH, Munich. Teaming up with photographer Alex Rank, BMW and Jung von Matt have developed a new, confident visual language.\n\nThe First of a New Era I Introducing the New BMW iX3.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive WLTP combined (EnVKV): energy consumption 17.9 – 15.1 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions: 0 g/km; CO2 class A; range 678 – 805 km"}

As part of their long-standing strategic partnership, BMW Group and E.ON are launching Germany’s first commercial Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) solution for private customers.\n\nThanks to bidirectional charging, the BMW iX3 becomes an active participant in the energy market—able not only to consume electricity but also to feed energy back into the grid when needed. This groundbreaking offering represents a major technological and market milestone, seamlessly integrating electromobility with the energy transition. For the first time in Germany, electric vehicles can be used as flexible energy storage units in everyday life.\n\nCharge for free, support the energy system: How the new V2G solutions works\n\nThe new Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) solutions enables customers to benefit from bidirectional charging: the high-voltage battery of their BMW iX3 can flexibly supply energy back to the grid via the BMW Wallbox Professional. Intelligent energy management is provided in collaboration with E.ON, supported by a specially designed V2G electricity tariff that facilitates the flow of energy in both directions.\n\nThe underlying software was jointly developed by BMW Group and E.ON. The service is not only user-friendly but also financially attractive: customers who make their vehicle battery available for smart charging and discharging can earn an annual bonus of up to €720. This enables them to drive up to 14,000 kilometers per year at no charging cost while actively supporting the energy transition.\n\nMarc Spieker, Member of the Board of Management of E.ON SE, Commercial: “What our customers need is a reliably charged vehicle—simple, convenient, and at attractive costs. That’s exactly what we provide, and more. Together with BMW, E.ON is bringing Vehicle-to-Grid directly to the people. Neue Klasse meets new energy! This is how we unlock the potential of the vehicle for each individual’s personal energy future. We combine charging convenience with tangible economic benefits. And, as a bonus, every connected vehicle can help lower the overall costs of the energy system—for the benefit of all.”\n\nDr. Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development: „With the Neue Klasse, BMW makes the car an active part of the energy system, creating tangible customer value. Vehicle-to-Grid reduces the mobility costs of the customer through new revenue opportunities – while driving the future of electric mobility.”\n\nDriving flexibility in the energy system with vehicle-to-grid\n\nThe new V2G offering marks a milestone in coupling the energy sectors of mobility and electricity: the vehicle becomes an integral part of a virtual storage system that can better integrate renewable energies and thus support the energy system.\n\nOverview of the benefits:\n\nMarket launch and further strategic development\n\nThe technology for bidirectional charging will first be available on the market with the BMW iX3 and will gradually be introduced across additional BMW model ranges, thereby contributing to the scaling of V2G and its benefits for customers.\n\nIn the long term, the product is planned to be integrated into a comprehensive energy platform that intelligently connects charging infrastructure, photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and smart home systems. The strategic partnership between BMW and E.ON lays the foundation for such an open, interoperable, and customer-centric ecosystem.\n\n* This press release may contain forward-looking statements based on current assumptions and forecasts made by E.ON Group Management and other information currently available to E.ON.

This week, more than 100,000 spectators are once again expected at Wentworth Club to celebrate one of Europe’s most prestigious tournaments and the Festival of Golf at the BMW PGA Championship. Fans can look forward to an outstanding field at the Flagship Event of the DP World Tour. Eleven players from the European Ryder Cup team, led by captain Luke Donald (ENG), Masters champion Rory McIlroy (NIR), and FedExCup champion Tommy Fleetwood (ENG), will tee off alongside defending champion Billy Horschel (USA). Making his debut at Wentworth is Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama, the 2021 Masters winner.\n\nOther Green Jacket holders in the field include Jon Rahm (ESP), Patrick Reed (USA), Adam Scott (AUS), and Danny Willett (ENG). Additionally, Major champions Wyndham Clark (USA), Matt Fitzpatrick (ENG), Pádraig Harrington, Shane Lowry (both IRL), and Justin Rose (ENG) will compete.\n\nFollowing the tournament, Team Europe, the defending champions, will head to the USA where the 45th Ryder Cup (Bethpage Black, Long Island, New York) will take place in two weeks with Worldwide Partner BMW. The knowledgeable and enthusiastic crowd at the BMW PGA Championship will undoubtedly provide the team with a boost of momentum for the challenging task of defending the Ryder Cup on foreign soil.\n\nThe excitement traditionally reaches an early peak on Wednesday with the Celebrity Pro-Am, featuring numerous stars from sports and entertainment. This year’s lineup includes three-time tennis Grand Slam champion Andy Murray (SCO), Formula 1 driver Lando Norris (ENG), football legends Gareth Bale (WAL) and Stephanie Houghton, rugby royalty Owen Farrell and Henry Pollock, as well as pop star Tom Grennan (ENG).\n\nThe popular live concerts over the weekend remain a cornerstone of the Festival of Golf. On Saturday, the British band Razorlight will rock the Show Stage in the Championship Village after play concludes, while Ella Henderson will bring the BMW PGA Championship to an atmospheric close with her performance on Sunday.\n\nBrand new this year – in more ways than one – is the Hole-in-One Prize at the 14th hole, the new all-electric BMW iX3 50 xDrive which makes its UK debut at Wentworth. The Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) made its world premiere just days ago in Munich as the first Neue Klasse model. The fully electric vehicle marks the dawn of a new era of ‘Sheer Driving Pleasure’. Compared to its predecessor of the same name, the new BMW iX3 creates the impression that a complete model generation has been skipped in design and technology. Among its impressive features are a range of up to 805 kilometres (500 miles) and the ability to charge up to 372 kilometres (231 miles) of range in just ten minutes.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 will also be on display at the heart of the Championship Village, alongside other themed areas such as BMW M, 50 Years of the BMW 3 Series, MINI, a Ryder Cup photo opportunity, and the all-new BMW Golfsport Collection by Puma. Customers arriving in a BMW Group vehicle will enjoy numerous perks, including free parking in the BMW Owners’ Car Park, shuttle service to the main entrance, and access to a fast lane. Additionally, they will have exclusive access to the BMW Owners’ Terrace at the 11th hole, and reserved seating on the grandstand on the 14th green."}

With the new brand impulse GEN M (GENERATION M), BMW M is opening another chapter in the brand’s illustrious history, transferring the iconic M DNA to a global community that is as diverse as the vehicles themselves. “Born on the racetrack. Made for the streets. Core of a passionate community.” That is the BMW M brand identity, deeply rooted in its DNA. It characterises vehicles that have defined best-in-class standards in their respective categories for more than 50 years. GEN M is the spiritual home for all those to whom motorsport and performance are an integral part of their identity. It is the logical next step after BMW M Town, launched in 2018 as a virtual space – a dream home – for BMW M enthusiasts. GEN M was already a tangible part of the 2025 24-hour races and will now also be on show in the BMW M pop-up “M Clubhouse” at the IAA Mobility in Munich (11 – 14 September).\n\n“GEN M is for all those who view our motorsport origins and performance as a defining element of their way of life,” says Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President Customer, Sales and Brand of BMW M GmbH. “It’s a way of life that connects people of all ages, across different backgrounds and aspirations.”\n\nFrom product to personality.GEN M is about a change of perspective. The new platform puts people and their commitment to performance centre stage. At the same time, it also appeals to younger fans, encouraging their enthusiasm. What unites these people is not their origin or affiliation. Nor whether they are behind the wheel or on board as a passenger. The new approach for GEN M deliberately embraces a community-first concept. Supported by real-life stories from M drivers around the world. Performance and the pursuit of excellence are the hallmark and unifying factor of this global movement. Like a common pulse.\n\nGEN M celebrates motorsport, urban street style and a unique culture of automobiles as well as M motorbikes. It includes all those who use M Performance Parts to refine and customise their vehicles, along with a constantly growing social media community. It links personal lifestyles and technology, tradition and innovation, individual stories and collective enthusiasm. And this means it is as diverse as the BMW M vehicles themselves.\n\nFocus: authenticity and real people.In the brand film “GEN M – United by Performance”, BMW M shows what this new era centred around the BMW M1 and BMW 3.0 CSL, around all BMW M models and powertrains and motorsport vehicles of all kinds is about. No actors, no staged scenes, instead real people – members of the global M community, from hardcore fans to motorbike riders, key opinion leaders and race car drivers. Around 30 individuals from different markets and contexts are involved, with some of them explaining what “M” and the BMW M community mean to them. And as diverse as they are, they all have one thing in common: a commitment to high performance. The defining factor is an attitude, a mindset, a sense of community.\n\nKick-off in Le Mans, BMW M pop-up store at the IAA Mobility in Munich.GEN M was first presented at the 93rd edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the BMW M Motorsport fan stand, numerous BMW M fans, the active BMW M Motorsport works drivers and M CEO Frank van Meel were able to immortalise themselves by adding their signatures, as the first members of GEN M, to a BMW Individual Speed Yellow BMW M5 Touring with M Performance Parts. Accompanied by racing drivers and enthusiasts who are also GEN M members. GEN M made its next appearance at the 24-hour race in Spa-Francorchamps. With visible branding on the BMW M4 GT3 EVO from ROWE Racing BMW, driven by BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng, Dan Harper and Max Hesse. This was followed by further exposure at world-class events like the Festival of Speed in Goodwood (UK). Two GEN M cars will make a major appearance at the Suzuka Circuit from 12 to 14 September, as part of the Intercontinental GT Challenge.\n\nThe IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich offers the opportunity to come into very close contact with GEN M - or to recognize yourself as part of it and even take home individualized GEN M giveaways - with your own BMW M pop-up, the \"M Clubhouse\" in the Goldberg Studios, Müllerstraße, in the Glockenbachviertel. From September 11 to 14, the \"M Clubhouse\" will be open to GEN M and all those who want to become one (the exact opening hours can be found here: - during the day as a relaxed get-together in an M atmosphere, in the evening with exclusive DJ sets.\n\nThe new BMW M fragrance collection will also have its premiere there. The “1972” (BMW 3.0 CSL) and “1985” (BMW M3, E30) eau de toilettes refer to milestones in the history of BMW M. “2025” marks the high-performance brand’s entry into the world of fragrances."}

Today, more than ever, global success depends on the ability to master new technologies and to anticipate what customers around the world want.\n\nIt also takes courage to make bold leaps. A pioneering spirit – to explore new paths. Confidence in your own abilities. And resilience – to stay the course, even in the face of headwinds. And on top it requires a team of nearly 160,000 employees who are passionate about shaping the future of mobility. Then evolution becomes revolution. Vision becomes reality.\n\nYou’ll remember that, back in 2021, I promised we would lead BMW into a new era. With the NEUE KLASSE. Today, we deliver on that promise.\n\nEarly this decade, we recognized an opportunity; a chance to set new benchmarks across all relevant technologies in the car. It was an opportunity that only comes once in a lifetime. The perfect BMW moment.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is much more than just a new vehicle. It marks a completely new model generation. A massive leap that redefines the entire brand.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 will be followed by more than 40 new or updated BMW models by 2027. Each will have the NEUE KLASSE genes – regardless of the drivetrain. More than any other project, the NEUE KLASSE represents the innovative spirit of all our associates. Across all our brands.\n\nOn behalf of the entire company, it is my great honor to unveil:\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nI’ve been with the BMW Group for 34 years. I’ve witnessed many world premieres and bold technological innovations. But a vehicle like this is something you experience only once. All of us at the BMW Group have been working tirelessly towards this moment.\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we’ve created an unprecedented interplay of multiple, ground-breaking technologies. Now, we are taking Sheer Driving Pleasure to a whole new level. In short: The NEUE KLASSE is more BMW than ever.\n\nAnd the next highlight is already waiting in the wings. Early next year, we will unveil the second model of the NEUE KLASSE – a sporty sedan at the very core of the brand:\n\nthe new all-electric BMW i3.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nFrom the drivetrain to battery technology and driving dynamics, from the operating system to the digital user experience: We’ve elevated every single aspect to the next level for the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nWith this new design language, we’ve even skipped a whole generation. And there's no one better to explain how our customers will experience this with all their senses than Adrian van Hooydonk.\n\nSpeech Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design\n\nWelcome ladies and gentlemen!\n\nYes, the big moment has finally come. As Oliver mentioned, with the Neue Klasse we are taking very big steps in technology. These bigger steps in technology can only become meaningful hand in hand with big steps in design. The BMW iX3 has a much bigger range helped by a very clean shape with excellent aerodynamics.\n\nIn the interior you will find a new display concept that allowed us to clean-up the dashboard and completely redefine the driving experience.\n\nBut let‘s look at the exterior design first: We have typical solid BMW SAV proportions with a lot of presence and emphasis on all four wheels. The surfaces are very clean with only a few precise lines. The front-end shows a new interpretation of the BMW typical face in which we replace chrome with light. Vertically oriented kidneys match the more upright overall appearance of our SAV. This new light signature is part of the daytime running light and it will make the new BMW iX3 very recognizable by day and by night. Overall, the car has a very solid stance and strong shoulders and, in the rear, again a new light signature that emphasizes the width of the car.\n\nIn the interior you will find that the driving experience is and will remain our focus, putting the driver at ease and in control! The key element to this is our all-new BMW Panoramic Vision which projects in the bottom of the windscreen and builds upon our years of experience with head-up displays. This new display is visible for all passengers on board and will allow you to quickly check the information you want and need while keeping your hands on the wheel and your focus on the road ahead. Together with our new free cut central display and iconic steering wheel these elements are the corner stones of our new Panoramic\n\niDrive system, a whole new driving experience that you will find in all our future BMW models from now on!\n\nThis new user experience already starts when you approach the car and continues as you get in and set the car up to your personal preferences. With My Modes you can do that very easily and select a perfectly curated driving experience – from screen content or colors to light and sound and even driving characteristics.\n\nSo, our new Operating System X focuses on the best driving experience but will also allow you a much higher level of personalization making your new BMW truly yours! Overall, the new digital aspects of our cars will make them more intelligent and easier to use.\n\nAt the same time, this has allowed us to design much cleaner and warmer interiors, creating very personal living environments on four wheels. The interior trim “Digital White” is spacious and modern.\n\nSo, starting with the BMW iX3 we are introducing a new form language that will lead to a new look and feel for the entire BMW brand. Our designs will be very clean and at the same time very strong in character, but above all: more BMW than ever!\n\nSpeech Jochen Goller, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Customer, Brands, Sales\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nLet’s now move on to MINI, which celebrated its very own game-changing moment already last year with the introduction of a completely new product range.\n\nThe “New MINI Family”, covering the most desirable and broad product portfolio in the brand's history, now features four very distinct models - Convertible, Cooper, Aceman and Countryman. And regarding the drivetrain, MINI customers of course have the choice between all-electric or highly efficient combustion engines.\n\nClever use of space, wheels at the corner, go-cart feeling, combined with true Britishness and maximum individuality. That's how MINI became the world's most successful premium small car brand. Driving a MINI has always been a confident personal statement. In this way, MINI has inspired numerous celebrities and designers throughout its 66-years long history.\n\nAnd today, we are writing the next exciting chapter in this tradition. Partnering with a brand that stands for customization and thinking out of the box like few others. I am talking about Deus Ex Machina!\n\nThe outcome of this inspiring and exceptional partnership are two stunning John Cooper Works models – fraternal twins with very different styles, yet united by a shared enthusiasm.\n\nI brought one of them with me today, so, let’s have a look.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n“The Skeg.” A distinctive and contemporary re-interpretation of MINI's racing history. Pure. Bold. Innovative. This artwork on four wheels is based on the MINI John Cooper Works Electric. Inspired by the world of surfing, it offers pure electric freedom to enjoy the MINI go-cart feeling on coastal roads.\n\nHis twin – “The Machina” – is forged on the racetrack. Lean, fast and powered by a combustion engine, it embodies raw racing technology and authentic functionality.\n\nTogether, they stand for individual lifestyle and maximum driving excitement, regardless of the respective drive train.\n\nSimilar to what our customers can experience with the New MINI Family, which is winning over new and old customers worldwide.\n\nThat is especially true for our fully electric models. Today, already one in three MINIs has an electric heart. And the trend continues to rise.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nCollaborations like the one with Deus Ex Machina are just one example for unique customization – the way only MINI can do.\n\nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, to something completely different.\n\nSpeech Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is a great pleasure for me to present the BMW Motorrad Vision CE. It offers the most spectacular insight into our vision of future of urban\n\ne-mobility that we have ever developed. For me, the Vision CE is a clear proof to our ambition to shape the future of emission-free mobility with courage and a pioneering spirit.\n\nHighly innovative single-track urban mobility has been strongly anchored in the history of BMW Motorrad for decades. We revolutionized urban mobility already 25 years ago with the unique BMW C1. In 2014, we were the first manufacturer to combine outstanding design with an e-drive in the BMW C evolution. In 2022, we launched the CE 04, a design & technology masterpiece of emission-free mobility which remains the global market leader in its segment to this day.\n\nAt BMW Motorrad, the development of single-track e-mobility clearly stands for visionary concepts, innovation leadership and groundbreaking design. With the Vision CE's special self-balancing system, we are looking to the future and setting again new standards: Urban riding fun on two wheels without having to wear a helmet or motorcycle clothing, thanks to the unique structural bracket design.\n\nThe Vision CE – one like no other: Exciting and inspiring - just like BMW Motorrad!\n\nSpeech Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nAt the BMW Group, we are constantly reshaping mobility – just as we have for nearly 110 years. Our customers’ individual needs, wishes – and, yes, their dreams – are always at the heart of all our brands.\n\nAll of our customers benefit from our innovative approaches and the latest technologies. At the same time, we are steering the company on a long-term path that is in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThis is the spirit that drives us at the BMW Group."}

What initially seemed like a frustrating race for BMW M Motorsport turned into a podium celebration in the LMGT3 class during a spectacular final stage. At the \"Lone Star Le Mans”, the sixth round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) at the Circuit of the Americas, Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) secured second place on the podium in the Team WRT #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. In the Hypercar category, the BMW M Hybrid V8 fell significantly short of expectations. After six hours of racing, the #15 car finished in a disappointing twelfth place, while the sister car retired due to technical issues.\n\nRace week, which began with nearly 40-degree heat, turned into a wet event by the weekend. The track was already damp during qualifying, but the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 and both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs managed to secure spots in Hyperpole. However, none of the cars were initially able to capitalise on their strong starting positions during the race on the wet track. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 struggled with the conditions and was unable to generate the necessary grip on wet tyres for competitive lap times at any point. In the end, it finished in a disappointing twelfth place. The #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 retired early due to an electronics issue with the hybrid system.\n\nThe two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs started from fourth and ninth on the grid. They also faced challenges in the heavy rain but made a remarkable comeback in the final stage as the track began to dry. Final drivers van der Linde and Farfus gained position after position on slicks, climbing to third and fourth in the closing minutes of the race. Following post-race time penalties, the #46 car was promoted to second place, while the #31 car dropped to ninth after Farfus received a penalty for a collision with a Hypercar.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"What a turn of events in the final 30 minutes of the race! Congratulations to both LMGT3 crews for their spot-on strategic decisions and thrilling comebacks. The podium finish for car #46 is fantastic, though the post-race penalty slightly dampens the equally strong performance of the #31. Nevertheless, this is a satisfying conclusion to what had been a frustrating weekend up to that point. On the Hypercar side, we struggled significantly with the wet conditions during the race and were unable to showcase the potential we had demonstrated in practice sessions. That is very disappointing, as is the early technical failure for the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8. What happened today requires a very self-critical analysis. We need to be better prepared at Fuji and make more of the opportunities available to us.\"\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): \"On the Hypercar side, the weekend was very disappointing. We haven’t had much experience driving in such wet conditions, and it’s clear we still have a lot to learn in this area. We need to carefully analyse why we were unable to deliver any performance with the #15 car. The same applies to the hybrid system issue on the #20 car. On the GT3 side, the race was a rollercoaster. The podium finish for the #46 car allows us to look back on the race weekend with a smile.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 12th place): “This is not the race we wanted. We really struggled out there. Now we need to analyse and understand why we were so slow under these conditions today.”\n\nRené Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “It’s frustrating not to even be able to properly start the race. I think we had a good package and could have scored a lot of points here, but that’s how motorsport is sometimes. Now we have to focus on Fuji and try to get back on the podium there.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place): “This is a fantastic result for everyone, especially considering the issues we’ve had with pace over the past three weekends. These conditions were perfect for the car. We’re all very happy and proud; the team did an amazing job.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place): “This is incredible. I’m very happy with this podium – especially for the team. We had our struggles during the race and were even at the back at one point, but a race isn’t over until the checkered flag. Our car was unbelievably strong on slicks on the drying track at the end, and Kelvin did a fantastic job.”\n\nAhmad Al Harthy (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place): “This weekend was a rollercoaster. You should never give up, and we didn’t. We fought until the very last lap. The podium is a well-deserved reward for the entire team. It’s been a while since we’ve been up there. For me personally, it’s my first podium in the USA.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 9th place): “That was a very challenging race. We didn’t expect to finish in third and fourth, which later turned into second and ninth. The team did an amazing job. Congratulations to the #46 crew on the podium. I received a penalty for the contact with the Ferrari Hypercar. It was an unfortunate situation and by no means intentional. Something like that can happen in such a tight corner on a slippery track.”"}

On Sunday evening at Magny-Cours (FRA), all members of BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had one thing in common, a beaming smile. At the ninth round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) claimed pole position, secured the triple for the fourth time in a row, and set more records. With this, “El Turco” extended his lead in the riders’ championship to 39 points with three more rounds to go. This season he already has 18 victories to his name, twelve of them consecutive. Razgatlioglu’s win in Sunday’s second main race was also BMW’s 50th victory in WorldSBK.\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED) completed the team’s excellent showing in France. In Superpole qualifying, he secured eighth place and a spot on the third row of the grid. In the first main race on Saturday, he was already on course for a top-five finish but suffered a heavy crash. On Sunday, van der Mark reaped the rewards for his strong performance. He showed great race pace, delivered thrilling battles, and finished fifth in both the Superpole Race and the second main race. Razgatlioglu and van der Mark collected so many points for the manufacturers’ standings at Magny-Cours that BMW reduced its gap to leaders Ducati to just three points. The next round will take place from September 26 to 28 at MotorLand Aragón (ESP).\n\nReactions after the Magny-Cours round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a perfect start into the final stretch of the season for us. This weekend has finally made us forget that we had mixed feelings about Magny-Cours since last year. Now we are heading to Aragón with our heads held high to start the last quarter of the season. That Toprak has claimed his 12th consecutive victory is indescribable. Once again, he worked flawlessly this weekend. He didn’t make a single mistake, stayed very focused, and is currently playing in a league of his own. At every race weekend, he manages to extract everything perfectly from the BMW M 1000 RR. I’m especially delighted for Mickey as well. From day one here, he showed that the potential is huge. Although he crashed yesterday, today’s two fifth-place finishes and his thrilling battles with Jonathan Rea and Alvaro Bautista perfectly rounded off a fantastic weekend for him. A big thank you goes to the team and all the staff back home who worked hard even during the summer break and prepared for this perfect weekend. Now we are looking forward to Aragón. We had a good test there and are ready for the race weekend.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a wonderful weekend. From day one it was perfect teamwork, and the overall team performance is what made this weekend so successful. Everyone involved has worked hard over the past weeks to put both riders in a position to maximise the potential of our BMW M 1000 RR. And that we’ve made another step in this direction was confirmed by Mickey at Magny-Cours. From the first practice, he was very happy with the bike and delivered a fantastic performance. The crash in Saturday’s race was unfortunate, but his race pace was strong. He proved that today with an excellent showing in both the sprint and the second main race. We are very happy and also proud of what we have achieved with hard teamwork. That Toprak has once again taken the triple – even I am at a loss for words by now. All in all, we are ready for the last quarter of the season. That our deficit in the manufacturers’ standings is now down to just three points is tremendous. We’ll keep giving everything, at the track and in Munich, and we know we can rely on our consistently strong engines from Berlin. We’re excited for the final push!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am very happy. This is my favourite track and we did a really good job in every race. This weekend was very important for me because last year, I was not riding here but this year we did an incredible job. Thanks to my team because this was teamwork. We improved the bike and got faster with every session. I just focused on winning the races, and we got another hat-trick. I hope that we can also win the manufacturers’ title. This is teamwork – okay, I am riding strongly but also everyone is working so hard to prepare the bike. I’m happy working with these BMW guys because everyone is fantastic, everyone is working really hard and everyone is giving the best. And this is very important. I’m really feeling like in a family with this team. Now I am focused on Aragón, that will be another important weekend. I want to win there, too.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “When we started on Friday, I had quite a good feeling with the bike immediately and was enjoying it. This also was the case in Superpole, where I did a good lap. It could have been even better, but I was in the top ten and starting from there makes life a lot easier. In yesterday’s race one, I had a great start, a great pace and a very good rhythm but I made a mistake and crashed. I picked the bike up and then I was just too over excited and unfortunately crashed again. That left the team with a lot of damage and it was a bit embarrassing because we could have been in the top five on Saturday as well. But today was a new day, the team did a fantastic job to get a complete new bike build that was running without any problems. I really enjoyed the Superpole race, had some good battles and finished fifth so secured P5 on the grid for race two. That was fantastic but we knew it was going to be a long race so I tried to have a good start and to manage the tyres a bit. I wasn't feeling fantastic with the bike and had to find a good way to ride around the problems but I could manage my pace, keep a gap behind me and be consistent.

The first of a new era. The future of the car.\n\nI’ve been with the BMW Group for more than 34 years now. During this time, I’ve witnessed many world premieres, exciting new concepts and bold technological innovations. But, for me – and for all of us at the BMW Group – today’s premiere is truly a “once-in-a-lifetime moment”. When else do you get to re-imagine a brand like BMW from the ground up? The chance to create an entirely new generation of vehicles? The chance to break completely new ground?\n\nThis year’s #IAA MOBILITY brings us full circle. You’ll remember that,\n\nright here in Munich, back in 2021, I promised we would lead BMW into a new era. With the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nToday, just four years later, we deliver on that promise. Here's the proof. The NEUE KLASSE is much more than just one new car. It represents a completely new model generation. A massive leap that will shape the entire brand for years to come.\n\nWhy now? Why such a bold step? Because we know the time is right.\n\nGround-breaking innovations don’t come out of nowhere. They start with individual technological advances.\n\nWith people who recognize the untapped potential. With a visionary team that transforms those individual parts into something totally new – something far greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThat’s where we were at the start of the decade. We saw the chance\n\nfor a massive leap in development across all relevant technologies –\n\nfrom battery technology to digital user experience to computing power. A unique opportunity to completely rethink the car. It was a time for pioneers. In other words: the perfect BMW moment.\n\nWe have poured our vast experience, our wealth of technical know-how and – above all – our heart and soul into developing the NEUE KLASSE. It wasn’t easy. But, together, we made it happen.\n\nThis is what the #BMW iX3 represents.\n\nWe have taken the world with us on our “road to NEUE KLASSE”. Five vision vehicles. Highlighting five key aspects of the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nAt the beginning, we demonstrated how sustainability and circular economy could be realized in a premium product. BMW i Vision Dee blurred the lines between reality and the virtual world – and offered a first glimpse of our new BMW Panoramic iDrive. At the IAA Mobility in 2023, things got much more concrete. A typically sporty BMW sedan with the new design language of the NEUE KLASSE. This was soon followed by a look at the future of the Sports Activity Vehicles. As you can see: We were already close to the real thing at that point. Sheer Driving Pleasure – taken to a whole new level. The VDX demonstrated this. An impressive proof of the potential unlocked by integrating different technologies in the NEUE KLASSE. BMW driving dynamics at its finest.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nOur goal with the NEUE KLASSE was to create the best overall system for our customers. That’s why the iX3 and the upcoming vehicles of the NEUE KLASSE integrate everything we’ve showcased in recent years. When it comes to design, we have even skipped an entire generation. And there's no one better to explain how our customers will experience this with all their senses than Adrian van Hooydonk.\n\nSpeech Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design\n\nThank you, Oliver. Welcome ladies and gentlemen!\n\nYes, the big moment has finally come. We are launching the BMW iX3, the very first car of the NEUE KLASSE. As Oliver mentioned, we have been working on this for the past 4 years and with the NEUE KLASSE we are taking very big steps in technology. These bigger steps in technology can only become meaningful hand in hand with big steps in design.\n\nThe BMW iX3 has a much bigger range helped by a very clean shape with excellent aerodynamics. In the interior you will find a new display concept that allowed us to clean-up the dashboards and completely redefine the driving experience.\n\nBut let‘s look at the exterior design first:\n\nWe have typical solid BMW SAV proportions with a lot of presence and emphasis on all four wheels. The surfaces are very clean with only a few precise lines. The front-end shows a new interpretation of the BMW typical face in which we replace chrome with light. Vertically oriented kidneys match the more upright overall appearance of our SAV.\n\nThis new light signature is part of the daytime running light and it will make the new iX3 very recognizable by day and by night. Overall, the car has a very solid stance and strong shoulders and, in the rear, again a new light signature that emphasizes the width of the car.\n\nIn the interior you will find that the driving experience is and will remain our focus, putting the driver at ease and in control! The key element to this is our all-new BMW Panoramic Vision which projects in the bottom of the windscreen and builds upon our years of experience with head up displays. This new display is visible for all passengers on board and will allow you to quickly check the information you want and need while keeping your hands on the wheel and your focus on the road ahead. Together with our new free cut central display and iconic steering wheel these elements are the corner stones of our new Panoramic iDrive system, a whole new driving experience that you will find in all our future BMW models from now on!\n\nThis new user experience already starts when you approach the car and continues as you get in and set the car up to your personal preferences. With My Modes you can do that very easily and select a perfectly curated driving experience – from screen content or colors to light and sound and even driving characteristics.\n\nSo, our new Operating System X focuses on the best driving experience but will also allow you a much higher level of personalization making your new BMW truly yours. Overall, the new digital aspects of our cars will make them more intelligent and easier to use. At the same time, this has allowed us to design much cleaner and warmer interiors, creating very personal living environments\n\non four wheels. The interior trim “Digital White” is spacious and modern.\n\nBut what about other options?\n\nWe curated various interior trims with a lot of attention to detail,\n\ngiving each trim a unique & distinctive character. These trims can be combined with a wide variety of exterior colors giving our customers plenty of choice in a few easy steps.\n\nSo, starting with the BMW iX3 we are introducing a new form language that will lead to a new look and feel for the entire BMW brand. Our designs will be very clean and at the same time very strong in character, but above all: more BMW then ever!\n\nSpeech Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG\n\nThank you, Adrian. From driving dynamics to drivetrain, from battery technology to the operating concept and digital user experience: Every one of these elements has been significantly enhanced for the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nLooking at the performance data for the BMW iX3 gives you an idea\n\nof what our customers can look forward to. The iX3 is all-electric. With more range and faster charging: that was our promise – and we have delivered. The iX3 offers a range of more than 800 kilometers in the WLTP cycle. Range anxiety? We’re making sure it’s a thing of the past. Also thanks to its ultra-fast charging capability: The peak charging power is up to 400 kilowatts. In other words: In just 10 minutes, the iX3 charges enough to drive more than 370 kilometers.\n\nAt BMW, we are known for our driver orientation. Hands on the wheel, eyes on the road, with the right data just where you need it.\n\nWith BMW Panoramic iDrive, the windscreen itself even becomes\n\na projection surface – merging reality and the virtual world in perfect interplay. Here, we're once again setting a new standard – and not just in the iX3. We’re rolling out BMW Panoramic iDrive across our entire product range.\n\nThe iX3 also strikes perfect harmony between hardware and software. Four central computers deliver the necessary computing power, processing data up to 20 times faster than conventional systems: genuine super-brains. BMW drivers will appreciate one of these systems in particular – the Heart of Joy, which combines all functionalities for the drivetrain and driving dynamics: Over 100 years of expertise in driving dynamics, now enhanced by digital capabilities. You’ll feel the difference right away. Whether you’re pushing the limits or driving in everyday situations. This is Sheer Driving Pleasure taken to a whole new level.\n\nThe experience also includes state-of-the-art automated assistance systems, tailored to our customers’ needs: dependable at all times, without compromising safety. Driver and vehicle become one.\n\nWe call this BMW Symbiotic Drive.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWe know that without responsibility, there can be no real progress. That is why decarbonization and resource conservation are key\n\nin the development of the iX3 and the NEUE KLASSE. Throughout the entire life cycle. We also apply principles of design for circularity.\n\nThe vehicle standing here next to me is made up of one third secondary raw materials. We are focusing on becoming more efficient and consuming less energy and resources. Whether in the\n\nsupply chain, in production or on the road.\n\nThe iX3 is a perfect example of our strategy of reducing CO2 wherever we have leverage. We are on a transparent and reliable path towards climate neutrality, in line with the Paris agreement - using all drivetrain technologies.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nGreater electric range. Faster charging. A more immersive digital experience. The next level of Sheer Driving Pleasure. A greater focus\n\non sustainability. And all of this in an incredibly attractive package. The BMW iX3 is truly more BMW than ever. And this is just the beginning!\n\nWe are rolling out the design, innovation and the latest technologies across all our vehicles. All our models will benefit from the advances made in the NEUE KLASSE – regardless of the drivetrain.\n\nWe have made a conscious decision to start out in the high-volume segments – because the NEUE KLASSE was never designed\n\nfor a niche. We want all our customers to benefit from the innovations as quickly as possible.\n\nThe next vehicle is already waiting in the wings. The details are still hidden beneath the camouflage, but I’m sure you’ll recognize the classic proportions of a sporty sedan.\n\nIt will be released next year as the Series’ first all-electric version. And it will be the first model variant of the new 3 Series generation.\n\nFor the past 50 years and over seven model generations, no other vehicle has been as closely tied to the success of the BMW brand. The 3 Series embodies everything at the very core of BMW. Innovation. Digital user experience. Comfort. Sportiness. Together, these characteristics create an incomparable driving experience. Sheer driving pleasure at its finest.\n\nAfter the launch of the i3, more variants will follow.\n\nThe iX3 and the i3 – a powerful symbol of the broad spectrum the NEUE KLASSE will cover. Production of the BMW iX3 will begin later this year at our new plant in Debrecen.\n\nFrom 2026, every new BMW will be all-new. We will launch\n\n40 different new and updated models. By 2027.That is the future. A new era. That is BMW.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt takes an exceptional team to bring projects like the NEUE KLASSE and vehicles like this one to life. A team with the unconditional desire, willpower and ability to shape the future. We, the Board of Management, stand before you today representing our nearly 160,000 BMW Group employees worldwide.\n\nOn behalf of us all, I want to thank our incredible team for their dedication and commitment over the last few years to reach this milestone moment.\n\nTogether, we are leading BMW into a new era.\n\nIn the event of enquiries, please contact:\n\nBMW Group Unternehmenskommunikation"}

And an all-encompassing sustainability concept reduces the car’s product carbon footprint over its life cycle by more than 30 per cent compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe first Neue Klasse model will be built at the newly constructed BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary. The first variant of the fully electric SAV to roll off the production line from autumn 2025 will be the BMW iX3 50 xDrive (electric power consumption, combined: 17.9 – 15.1 kWh/100 km; CO2 class: A; range: 679 – 805 km [421 – 500 miles]; provisional figures as per WLTP) with an output of 345 kW/469 hp and electric all-wheel drive. Further fully electric variants will follow, including an entry-level model. The market launch of the new BMW iX3 will get underway in Europe in spring 2026 and in the USA in summer 2026. Also starting in summer 2026 will be deliveries of a variant of the new BMW iX3 produced at the Shenyang facility that has been tailored specifically to the needs and desires of customers in China.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 represents a leap forward in development over its predecessor of the same name that extends well beyond the reaches of a conventional model renewal. The advances made in terms of design and technology create the impression that a complete vehicle generation has been skipped. For the BMW Group, the launch of the new BMW iX3 also represents a milestone in the transformation process when it comes to electrification, digitalisation and circularity. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, it offers customers the latest design and technology innovations, which will shape the brand’s entire model range moving forwards. The technologies of the Neue Klasse will be incorporated into a total of 40 new models and model updates between now and 2027.\n\n“The Neue Klasse is our biggest future project and marks a huge leap in terms of technologies, driving experience and design,” says Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “Practically everything about it is new, yet it is also more BMW than ever. Our entire product range will benefit from the innovations of the Neue Klasse – regardless of the drive technology. What started as a bold vision has now become reality: the BMW iX3 is the first Neue Klasse model to go into series production. We are not only bringing the next generation of one of our most successful fully electric vehicles onto the road, we are launching a new era for BMW.”\n\nLaunch of the new design language: reduced, characterful and timeless.\n\nMajor technological advances always offer an opportunity to introduce more significant design changes. The new BMW iX3 will launch the new BMW design language, which will be replicated across the whole of the brand’s model range in due course. This new use of forms provides a very modern interpretation of BMW’s original and enduring blueprint. The design is timeless while also capturing the prevailing zeitgeist. It is reduced to the essence of the BMW brand – and therefore more BMW than ever. For this one reason why comprehensive design protection has been registered for the new BMW design language used in the new BMW iX3.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 showcases the values and qualities of the Neue Klasse within the template of an SAV. The first BMW X model of the new generation is all about interior space and a progressive lifestyle. At 4,782 millimetres in length, 1,895 millimetres wide and 1,635 millimetres tall, the new BMW iX3 has the hallmark proportions of an SAV. The characteristic two-box design is infused with the rugged presence of a BMW X model and has precise lines that emphasise all four wheels. Detail optimisation of the car’s aerodynamics enables a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.24.\n\nThe load compartment capacity of the new BMW iX3 can be increased from 520 to a maximum 1,750 litres by folding down the rear seat backrest elements as required. The additional storage compartment under the bonnet can hold another 58 litres of cargo. Customers needing additional transportation capacity can specify their car with the optional electric fold-in/fold-out trailer tow hitch. The maximum trailer load of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive is 2,000 kilograms.\n\nThe upright front end and clearly formed surfaces endows the new BMW iX3 with considerable presence. The BMW kidneys and twin headlights – both distinctive BMW design cues – take centre stage visually. The sculpted BMW kidneys reference the Neue Klasse of the 1960s in their vertical arrangement. An all-new light signature assumes the role previously performed by chrome in giving the car an aura of quality and sophistication. And when viewed from the side, large surfaces broken up by a small number of precise lines create a character-rich appearance. Flush glass surfaces and door handles are also features of the side view. The robust stature of the new BMW iX3 is underscored by body-colour wheel arches with – in familiar BMW X model style – subtly rectangular contours. The rear end also cuts a powerful and athletic figure. The taillights extending well into the centre of the rear end represent a horizontal interpretation of the signature BMW “L” shape.\n\nInterior design: modern space has a BMW-typical driver focus and offers exceptional comfort for all passengers.\n\nThe design of the BMW iX3 interior sets new standards in terms of modernity and digital experience. The interior has an uncluttered, reduced design, providing the ideal stage for the digital experience. The cabin is all about the clear driver focus for which BMW is renowned and comfort for all those on board. Created specifically for electric vehicles, the vehicle architecture allows for extremely generous levels of space in all five seats. The lines of the “floating” instrument panel flow directly into the large door trim panels, creating an enveloping wrap-around effect for the passengers. With its fabric surface, the instrument panel – with atmospheric backlighting – contributes to the warm and inviting atmosphere inside. Large window surfaces and the optional panoramic sunroof with climate comfort glazing generate an ambience bathed in light.\n\nAnother prominent influence in the horizontally arranged cockpit is the new control/operation system BMW Panoramic iDrive, which is based on the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X. It brings together displays, geometry and light & sound design into a holistic experience, customisable via the My Modes. Also playing a role here are the new driving sounds, sound effects and sound signals of the BMW HypersonX soundscape created specifically for the Neue Klasse.\n\nThe elegantly minimalist seats of the new design stand out with their excellent comfort levels over long journeys, sporty character, and wide range of adjustment. Also sporting an all-new design are the steering wheel and the centre console between the driver’s seat and front passenger seat, complete with storage areas and control elements. The rear seat bench offers a single, sofa-like seat surface.\n\nPrecisely arranged interior worlds bring a unique and thoroughly distinct character to every equipment package. The materials and colour schemes selected are inspired by modern interior design and advanced Neue Klasse technology, and coordinated harmoniously with one another. They therefore make a noticeable, visible contribution to the exceptional comfort levels on board the new BMW iX3. An attractive range of colours enables a perfect match between the interior tones and exterior paint finishes. As alternatives to the standard-specification Essential interior design in Vivid Grey with Econeer seat coverings, customers can also choose from three other compositions in Veganza, the black BMW M interior world in Veganza and M PerformTex, and the BMW Individual option with a high-quality Merino leather/M PerformTex combination in Black Bicolour or Adelaide Grey.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 can be specified as an option with the M Sport package or M Sport package Pro from launch. Its dynamic looks are further emphasised by Black high-gloss features for the exterior, and M Sport seats and an M steering wheel inside the car.\n\nThe BMW Iconic Glow exterior package enables an impressive sound and light sequence with Relaxed, Balanced and Excited styles. The welcome sequence commences as soon as the driver approaches the vehicle and, as they take their seat, an animated greeting begins in the BMW Panoramic Vision and Central Display, spreading smoothly from the driver’s side of the cockpit to the front passenger side.\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive: consummate driver focus, BMW-style.\n\nThe BMW iX3 is the first series-produced model in which BMW Panoramic iDrive redefines the user experience and therefore also Sheer Driving Pleasure. With its neatly judged balance between digital functions and physical elements, BMW Panoramic iDrive elevates intuitive operation – according to BMW’s fabled “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” principle – to a new level of driver focus. The entire system is born out of decades of experience and a user-centric design approach. Individual customer feedback, data from over 10 million connected vehicles and usability studies with more than 3,000 customers were all incorporated into the development process. Physical controls are on hand, including for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selector, parking brake, hazard warning lights, rear window heating and defrost function. Other functions have been optimised for use by touch and voice command or via the multifunction steering wheel.\n\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has been significantly upgraded and now includes two new voices, a new appearance for the BMW Panoramic Vision and additional assistance for the driver through proactive suggestions and personalisable routines. Large Language Model (LLM) technology will also be gradually introduced to enable even more intuitive voice interaction in the future.\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive brings four central elements together into a unique display and control/operation system. The BMW Panoramic Vision projects information across the full width of the windscreen, from A-pillar to A-pillar. The content in the centre and on the front passenger side can be adapted to personal tastes and requirements. Key driving information appears in the driver’s field of vision. And above the BMW Panoramic Vision, the BMW 3D Head-Up Display (if specified) can now also show integrated navigation and automated driving displays on the road with spatial depth. The free-cut-design Central Display with matrix backlight technology is located in an ergonomically ideal position next to the steering wheel. On the driver’s side, vertically arranged widgets enable fast and direct access to particularly frequently used functions using QuickSelect tech. The new multifunction steering wheel serves as the primary physical control point. Its button panels help the driver and vehicle to work together symbiotically using illuminations, a relief-like surface and haptic feedback.\n\nUnderpinning BMW Panoramic iDrive is the likewise newly developed BMW Operating System X, which offers extensive scope for personalisation via the BMW ID, intelligent driver assistance, a wide variety of digital functions, extensive connectivity using the My BMW App and outstanding future-proofing thanks to BMW Software Updates.\n\nThe standard-fit navigation system BMW Maps features an upgrade for the charging-optimised route guidance, plus intelligently coordinated presentation of information on the BMW Panoramic Vision, Central Display and optional 3D Head-Up Display. The BMW Digital Key Plus can be set up on smartphones and smartwatches from all the leading makers, also as standard. Meanwhile, BMW Operating System X unlocks a wide variety of entertainment while on the road and during charging stops, bringing customers not only music streaming apps such as Spotify and in-car gaming with AirConsole, but also a video-streaming app offering Disney+, YouTube and other international/numerous country-specific on-demand and live video platforms. The Zoom App for video calls is now also available for use.\n\nThe BMW ConnectedDrive Store provides an overview of the features customers can currently download or access, and these can be added easily and flexibly through ConnectedDrive Upgrades. For example, more than 60 third-party apps in the music & audio, entertainment, gaming, news, and travel & local categories are available worldwide. To download the features and use the apps, customers will need access to connectivity via BMW Digital Premium or a WiFi network/smartphone hotspot. The BMW Digital Premium range of features customers can add as they desire comprises extensive safety functions, extended navigation features, unlimited data for entertainment and now also BMW M Apps.\n\nSixth-generation BMW eDrive technology: higher efficiency, more range, faster charging.\n\nThe sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the Neue Klasse comprises highly efficient electric motors, fundamentally new high-voltage batteries with cylindrical cells, and 800V technology. The BMW iX3 50 xDrive is powered by two electric motors, which together generate output of 345 kW/469 hp and 645 Nm (475 lb-ft) of torque. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (130 mph). Its electric all-wheel-drive configuration consists of an extensively upgraded electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) with particularly high levels of efficiency at the rear axle and, at the front axle, a new asynchronous motor (ASM) distinguished by its compact design and high cost efficiency. The combination of EESM and ASM is evidence of the BMW Group’s commitment to technological neutrality within electric mobility as well. The drive technology developed for the Neue Klasse reduces energy losses by 40 per cent compared to fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, weight by 10 per cent and manufacturing costs by 20 per cent.\n\nThe new high-voltage battery concept with cylindrical cells for the Neue Klasse also achieves significant advances. The energy density on a cell level is 20 per cent higher than with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, and the new concept also paves the way for a 30 per cent increase in charging speed. The cylindrical cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell to pack”), which benefits energy density and cost efficiency. Added to which, the high-voltage battery is integrated into the vehicle architecture as a structural component to minimise weight (“pack to open body”). The high-voltage battery in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has a usable energy content of 108.7 kWh, enabling a range of up to 805 kilometres (500 miles) in the WLTP cycle.\n\nBMW Charging: short charging times, premiere for bidirectional charging.\n\nThe advances brought by sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology have a significant influence on the charging experience, too. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables users to fill their new BMW iX3 with enough energy at an 800V direct current (DC) rapid charging station to add up to 372 kilometres (231 miles)[1] of range in just ten minutes. The high-voltage battery can charge from 10 to 80 per cent capacity in 21 minutes. Thanks to the battery management tech with integrated switching matrix developed completely in-house by the BMW Group, the new BMW iX3 can also be charged from 400V DC stations. Upgrades to the battery preparation also help to shorten charging times. The new BMW iX3 50 xDrive can top up on alternating current (AC) at 11 kW as standard or 22 kW[2] as an option.\n\nExtensive bidirectional charging functions[3] are also available for the new BMW iX3, meaning that it can be used as an energy supply source for a variety of applications. The Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) function turns the new BMW iX3 into a mobile powerbank, which can supply electric devices with power while on the move. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) hands it the role of storage unit for solar energy generated by home-fitted photovoltaic systems. And customers can also hook their car up to the energy market via the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) application and earn some money in the process.\n\nThe selection of standard-fitted and optional charging accessories has been significantly expanded. For flexible charging during a journey, customers can make use of the new Multifunction Charger, which comes with several adapters for charging and discharging the high-voltage battery. The new BMW Wallbox Professional (DC) enables bidirectional charging at home or work. And BMW Charging offers the option of cost-optimised /solar-power-optimised home charging. Emblematic of the charging experience in this new vehicle generation is the intelligent charging flap of the new BMW iX3, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the customer’s intention to top up their car and then automatically opens or closes. And sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology makes it possible to view the current charging speed and curve in the My BMW App. Up to ten individual charging contracts from various suppliers can be shown digitally inside the new BMW iX3, enabling use of the Plug & Charge Multi Contract function.\n\nHeart of Joy: Sheer Driving Pleasure reaches a new level.\n\nOne of four “superbrains” in the electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy looks after drivetrain and driving dynamics management. This high-performance control unit is responsible for the drivetrain, brakes, energy recuperation and steering subfunctions, and processes information up to ten times faster than conventional control units. In this way, the potential of electric mobility in terms of instantaneous power delivery, smooth power transfer, agility, stability and efficiency is utilised to the full.\n\nTogether with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack developed fully in-house, the Heart of Joy calculates all the driving dynamics parameters with a new level of speed and precision. Here, the decades of experience of BMW in the field of driving dynamics control come to the fore. The driver and passengers in the new BMW iX3 experience a uniquely harmonious and BMW-typical driving feeling whatever the situation and speed. Every movement of the accelerator, brake pedal and steering is executed directly and with assurance and precision. Supreme traction and – thanks to the unique Soft Stop function – the smoothest stopping process ever achieved by a BMW are among its other attributes. In addition, the efficiency of the new BMW iX3 is optimised by the integrated management of drivetrain, braking system and energy recuperation. In everyday driving, 98 per cent of braking manoeuvres are carried out using recuperation only, i.e. without application of the friction brakes.\n\n“Superbrain of automated driving” for the driver assistance systems with new-generation technology.\n\nAnother high-performance computer brings together all the automated driving and parking functions in the BMW iX3. With 20 times greater processing power than conventional control units, the “superbrain of automated driving” enables a significant technological advance with the Neue Klasse in this area as well.\n\nBMW Symbiotic Drive provides seamless support. The BMW iX3 uses its Symbiotic Drive capability combined with driver assistance to create a completely new driving experience. Whenever the driver wants to accelerate, brake or steer, their inputs merge seamlessly and intuitively with AI-enabled software.\n\nThe result is a whole new form of Sheer Driving Pleasure. These driver assistance functions are generally already included as standard with entry-level specification. For example, the automatic cruise control system is not deactivated with only a light press of the brake pedal; instead, it is only switched off when the driver brakes harder. In the same way, the lane control assistance remains active even after a small steering input by the driver.\n\nThe further-developed BMW motorway assistant supports BMW iX3 drivers from the moment they join a motorway until they leave it, and allows them to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods. The functionality offered by the City Assistant includes traffic light detection, where the car automatically stops and then moves off again.\n\nNew electronics architecture with four “superbrains”.\n\nThe completely newly developed electronics architecture comprises a total of four high-performance computers known as “superbrains”. They pool their processing power for driving dynamics, automated driving, infotainment and basic & comfort-enhancing functions. They also provide the basis for a new software architecture that can be continuously upgraded and is therefore designed to incorporate upcoming function updates including AI features.\n\nThe new digital nervous system consists of a wiring harness divided into four zones. This reduces weight by 30 per cent compared to the technology used previously and allows for around 600 metres less wiring. Another new feature are digital “smart eFuses”, which replace classical safety fuses. They enable intelligent power modes for different vehicle states that help to improve the car’s overall efficiency.\n\nWith its four superbrains and highly connected software platforms, the BMW iX3 is a true software-defined vehicle and exceptionally well equipped for the future. Added to which, the new electronics architecture forms the basis for multifaceted improvements in the networking of the BMW iX3 with the My BMW App. This new level of quality when it comes to integration delivers new experiences and holds considerable potential for future innovations.\n\nEquipment and individualisation to enhance driving pleasure, comfort and versatility.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 will be available with one solid and five metallic paint finishes from launch. As an alternative to the 20-inch light-alloy wheels fitted as standard, customers can also browse an exclusive selection of new light-alloy wheels (20-, 21- and 22-inch) available as an option. The range also includes BMW M and BMW Individual light-alloy wheels, some in aerodynamically and weight-optimised Air Performance specification.\n\nCustomers can tailor the design of the cabin to their personal style with the help of the Essential, Contemporary, M Sport and BMW Individual interior design worlds. The driver’s seat and front passenger seat are heated and electrically adjustable as standard. M Sport seats and multifunction seats are available as options. Also on the options list are a sports steering wheel and an M Sport steering wheel.\n\nStandard specification for the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive also includes two-zone automatic climate control, Comfort Access, automatic tailgate operation, the extended exterior mirror package, an alarm system and the telephony with wireless charging function. Among the other highlights of the optional equipment offering are three-zone automatic climate control, adaptive headlight functions with intelligent light control, the BMW Iconic Glow package including illuminated BMW kidneys, the Harman Kardon HiFi system with 13 speakers, steering wheel heating and a large panoramic sunroof, whose climate comfort glazing has unique solar energy filtering and 100-per cent UV protection.\n\nHolistic sustainability approach targeting circularity and CO2e reduction .\n\nThe BMW Group kicked off the development of its upcoming vehicle generation by intensifying its efforts to systematically implement “Design for Circularity” principles and further reduce CO2e emissions throughout the product life cycle. A holistic sustainability approach has therefore been applied for the new BMW iX3.\n\nA variety of measures ensures that the product carbon footprint of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive over its full life cycle – based on a mileage of 200,000 kilometres (124,260 miles) – is 34 per cent smaller than that of its predecessor. This means that, when charged with electricity from the European energy mix, it has a smaller product carbon footprint than a comparable combustion-engined (ICE) model after around 21,500 kilometres (13,358 miles). When charged exclusively with electricity from renewable sources, the BMW iX3 50 xDrive beats the comparable ICE model after only 17,500 kilometres (10,873 miles, WLTP combined), allowing customers to potentially achieve CO₂e advantages over the ICE model in as little as one year.\n\nAround one third of the new BMW iX3 is made from secondary raw materials. For example, the storage compartment under the front hatch and the engine compartment cover are made from 30 per cent[4] recycled marine plastic. The base material of the yarn for the Econeer seat textile, the headliner (textile) and the floor-mat carpet is made from 100 per cent[5] recycled PET. When it comes to the car’s chassis, aluminium consisting of 80 per cent secondary raw material is used for the swivel bearings and hub carriers, while the wheel rims are cast from aluminium with a 70 per cent secondary raw material content.\n\nThe overall product carbon footprint of the supply chain for the BMW iX3 50 xDrive has been reduced by 35 per cent. Production and operations at BMW Group Plant Debrecen do not use fossil fuels in normal operating conditions. And thanks to sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology and other BMW EfficientDynamics measures, the energy consumption of the new BMW iX3 is 20 per cent lower than that of the predecessor model (WLTP combined).\n\n[1] The added range after ten minutes of high-power charging was determined in accordance with ISO12906 in the WLTP cycle. This and the charging performance depend on the vehicle specification, battery charge, condition and temperature, individual driving profile, use of auxiliary consumers, ambient temperature and the charging power provided by the charging point.\n\n[2] Available from production period 3/2026.\n\n[3] Available from production period 3/2026.\n\n[4] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\n[5] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\n[6] The stated proportion of recycled material in per cent refers to the base polymer without taking into account the additives and fillers contained in the material.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."}

Celebrating MINI’s storied racing history, the two cars represent a shared enthusiasm for motorsport and customisation, each built with distinct design, function and creative innovation at their core.", "tags": ["MINI", "MINI John Cooper Works", "John Cooper Works Electric", "MINI Electric", "Concept Vehicles, Design Studies", "Special Vehicles"], "url": "https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0451827EN/mini-jcw-x-deus-ex-machina:-two-worlds-two-cars-singular-enthusiasm", "content": "Munich. With deep respect for craftsmanship, culture, and the communities that shape them, the partnership between MINI John Cooper Works and Deus Ex Machina comes to life through two customised one-off cars - rolling expressions of a lifestyle where a love of speed meets creativity and considered design. Built not just for performance, but for the people who live and breathe it.\n\n“MINI models have always been characterized by a blend of creative design and motorsport dynamics,’ explains Stefan Richmann, Head of MINI. “Thanks to our collaboration with Deus Ex Machina, we are taking this philosophy to a new level and setting exciting new trends for fans and motorsport enthusiasts. The partners are united by their “passion for machines, innovation and creativity” and an authentic relationship with their own community,” says Stefan Richmann.\n\nPurist, functional and graphic design approach.Both vehicle concepts are based on a MINI John Cooper Works model: the first, a MINI JCW Electric with up to 190 kW/258 hp, the second, a combustion engine-powered MINI JCW with 170 kW/231 hp. Each vehicles roof features a large white ‘X’, a connecting element, which signals a significant design and co-creation: the co-creation process between two iconic brands in their own right: MINI JCW x DEUS.\n\n\"In this extraordinary collaboration, we showcase two vehicles that remind us of motorsport history and successes of MINI. Every single detail has been crafted with artisanal precision and expertise. This has resulted in unique characters that are clearly perceived as belonging together through their distinctive design language and use of graphics,\" says Holger Hampf, Head of MINI Design.\n\nVisible seams, striking switches and traditional levers emphasise the mechanical character of the cockpits. The materials and colours utilised throughout the vehicles create bold contrasts: a deliberate break with high gloss. Instead of perfection, authenticity is at the forefront: designers speak of a ‘raw, handcrafted approach’ that celebrates the ‘beauty of imperfection’. On the exterior, expressive graphics consisting of numbers, geometric elements and bright colours pay homage to MINIs racing history.\n\nThe MINI JCW X DEUS one-off cars.Built as a pair - kindred in spirit, opposite in energy. One born of the coast: shaped by surfboards, sea spray, and the stripped-back rhythm of beach life. The other is forged on the track: lean, fast, and fuelled by a love of speed and precision.\n\nThe Skeg – sleek, electric, coast-bound.The electric powered show car ‘The Skeg’ is a clean, minimal and quiet rebellion, drawing on materials, technologies and philosophies from the world of surfing: Fiberglass, acceleration and minimalism.\n\nThe vehicles bodywork lands a bold first impression in a vivid yellow and silver finish - a nod to MINI’s progressive take on electric mobility. Wide fenders, an illuminated front grille, and a roof spoiler sharpen the silhouette, while semi-transparent fiberglass panels strip 15% of the car’s weight and refine its aerodynamic performance. At the rear, the Flex Tip Surf Spoiler responds to airflow much like a surfboard rides the contours of a wave. Its form draws from the concave underside of a board, redirecting movement, generating lift, and turning design into function.\n\nTension straps across the roof reference the familiar ritual of tying down a surfboard after a session, while remaining a characteristic design detail of the new MINI family, featured as an accent on the dashboard and in the 6 o'clock spoke of the steering wheel.\n\nCustom-made fiberglass elements on the roof, front, rear, and interior create a shifting play of light: translucent, strong, and responsive to time of day and environment, while the dashboard itself borrows directly from surfboard construction: lightweight, resilient, and visually distinctive.\n\nThe Interior.Inside, the analogue controls are stripped back - simple, tactile, and true to purpose, reflecting a surf culture that prioritises purpose over polish. The car resembles a mobile surf shop. An example of the thoughtful functionality is the fiberglass trays for wetsuits. The specially shaped shelves provide a practical storage solution and bring the surf culture into the interior. The neoprene upholstery in the lightweight racing bucket seats – flexible, water-repellent, and comfortable – also creates a tactile connection to surfing. The fiberglass dashboard transfers the technology of surfboard construction into the automotive sector. The oversized ‘X’ returns as a visual anchor, while Deus Collection badges and 3D-printed details in the console serve as subtle signifiers of a shared culture - one grounded in craft, connection, and the pursuit of the ride.\n\nThe Machina - loud, low, combustion-fed.The Machina, a John Cooper Works that packs a compact punch of raw mechanics and motorsport bloodline. Inspired by the aesthetics of motorsport, it stands for pure racing enthusiasm and authentic functionality.\n\nThe exterior: signature elements with links to the racing scene.The exterior design pays homage to the motorsport heritage of the MINI brand. Every characteristic feature has been carefully selected with a focus on functionality and emotional appeal.\n\nThe red, white and black paintwork, complete with bold accents and Deus lettering on the rear, makes an immediate impression. Classic widened fenders nod to racing heritage, blending form and function, while four additional headlights mounted on the bonnet pay tribute to rally sport roots. Each custom-built light pod features subtle Deus branding, offering both performance and a distinctive visual signature.\n\nAt the rear, the diffuser draws inspiration from the MINI JCW race car that tore through the legendary Nordschleife. Beyond its aggressive stance, it’s designed to optimise airflow and stability, with the centrally integrated exhaust serving as both a functional and aesthetic focal point, amplifying the engine’s sound and presence.\n\nUp front, a bespoke grille and perforated headlight surrounds enhance cooling performance, while the iconic MINI John Cooper Works light signature, complete with air intakes, anchors the car firmly in MINI’s high-performance lineage. Topping it off is a Can-Am-style rear spoiler: a bold piece of motorsport nostalgia that nods to an era when innovation in racing pushed both design and engineering to the edge.\n\nThe Interior.Inside the JCW show car, the red, white and black palette holds strong - pared-back, purposeful, and unmistakably John Cooper Works. The 5-point racing harnesses secure the driver, and ultimately become part of the driving experience, wrapping the body in precision.\n\nRaw aluminium floor plates offer more than grip, rather they echo the utilitarian aesthetic found in Deus’ custom motorcycle workshops from Sydney to Venice Beach to Canggu, grounding the car in a shared language of performance and craft.\n\nWeight-saving is built into every surface, from the stripped-back door panels marked with bold white ‘X’ motifs, to the waxed fabric dash - lightweight, durable, and finished with a lived-in patina that speaks to hands-on workmanship. Overhead, the exposed roll cage adds structure and statement in equal measure - a safety feature that nods to the car’s unfiltered racing DNA.\n\nThe show car's controls speak a clear language of functionality and directness. Every switch and every button is designed to function intuitively and reliably, even under extreme conditions.\n\nToggle switches are classic elements – no complex menus, just direct, mechanical connections between thought and action. Each button has a clear function. A classic example, the hydraulic handbrake with its large lever, acting as a direct connection between driver and vehicle - a commitment to precision and control. The JCW show car is a driving manifesto and a tribute to the motorsport DNA of the MINI brand.\n\nConcentrated creativity for two extraordinary designer pieces.In collaboration with the MINI design team, BMW Group subsidiary Designworks provided creative impetus with unconventional ideas for the project. Deus’ Creative Director, Carby Tuckwell and his wider creative cohort oversaw the striking exterior graphics of the unique cars - led by Matt Willey – and complimented the work - an outcome that truly reflects extraordinary design dynamics and remarkable solutions across the two vehicles.\n\n“Deus has had a longstanding creative partnership with Matt - one powered by a true respect for the power of design and art. Having him involved in this project, for us, was a no-brainer - he worked closely with myself and the Deus team on our first creative project that was splashed across a MINI car in 2023.” - Carby Tuckwell, Deus Co-Founder & Creative Director\n\nDeus x Matt Willey: The fascination of historic racing.Deus’ Carby Tuckwell and Matt Willey have been working together since 2015. United by their fascination with classic motorsport liveries, they created a historic Mini Cooper S racing car in 2023 with a special paint finish designed by Willey. The design references the glorious and victorious history of the classic Mini at the Monte Carlo Rally, including the number 37, with which Paddy Hopkirk started in 1964 and achieved the British small car's first overall victory in the most famous of all rallies.\n\nMatt Willey, a native of England who lives in Brooklyn, became a partner at the renowned design firm Pentagram after five years as art director of the New York Times Magazine.\n\nA Shared Vision Becomes Fabric.Woven into the partnership is a capsule MINI x Deus Ex Machina apparel collection, set to launch on September 8, 2025, at IAA in Munich, before becoming available globally via Deus Ex Machina’s e-commerce and retail network. Designed exclusively for the collaboration, the range draws on the shared DNA of both brands - precision engineering, timeless styling, and obsessive attention to detail. High-grade materials and thoughtful tailoring provide the benchmark for the range, with every garment reflecting Deus’ commitment to craftsmanship and its reputation for creating apparel that moves between lifestyle and legacy. With a deep understanding of storytelling through design, Deus brings authenticity and cultural relevance to the capsule, bridging the worlds of motorsport and modern apparel in a way that feels both current and enduring.\n\nYou can be first after me.The highlight of the MINI JCW x DEUS project's communication campaign will be the world premiere at IAA Mobility 2025 with the exclusive MINI JCW x DEUS Night on 6 September at the MINI Pavilion. The MINI JCW x DEUS collaboration will be on display at the MINI Pavilion until 14 September.\n\nThe exclusive MINI x DEUS lifestyle collection will be on sale in the same premises as well as online on all DEUS channels and in their sales rooms.\n\n‘You can be first after me’ – the motto that unites the worlds of MINI and Deus Ex Machina. Their shared history has begun and promises further exciting chapters in the name of automotive passion.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: The vehicles shown are showcars that are not available for sale."}

BMW Group Plant Steyr is getting ready for series production of fuel cell systems. The third generation of the BMW Group’s hydrogen drive system will be manufactured in Steyr from 2028, and the company’s competence centres in Munich and Steyr are already building the first prototypes. Further drive system components will come from the technology hub in Landshut.\n\n“The launch of the first-ever fuel cell production model from BMW in 2028 will add another exceptionally efficient high-performance drive system with zero emissions to our technology-open product portfolio,” says Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development. “The choice of Steyr as the production location clearly demonstrates our commitment to a European innovation footprint. The BMW competence centres in Munich and Steyr have a key role to play in the development of pioneering fuel cell systems.”\n\nThe third-generation BMW fuel cell system: more compact, more powerful, more efficient\n\nThe first generation of the fuel cell drive system was supplied entirely by the Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and was fitted in the BMW 535iA back in 2014. The second generation made its debut in the current BMW iX5 Hydrogen pilot fleet. This time, BMW developed the overall fuel cell system itself, while the individual fuel cells came from Toyota.\n\nFor the new generation, the BMW Group and the Toyota Motor Corporation jointly develop the powertrain system for passenger vehicles, with the core fuel cell technology creating synergies for both commercial and passenger vehicle applications. This close collaboration enables both companies to leverage synergies in development and procurement while creating brand-specific models.\n\nThe third generation of fuel cell technology brings some major improvements:\n\nTechnological expertise at the BMW Group in Munich\n\nThe BMW Group is making prototypes of the highly efficient fuel cell systems at the company’s competence centre for hydrogen in Munich. An electrochemical reaction takes place in the fuel cell, which involves hydrogen from the tanks reacting with oxygen from the air. This reaction produces electricity that powers the electric motor and thereby supplies the vehicle with energy.\n\nThe fuel cell system comprises not only the fuel cells themselves, but also all the components and systems needed for their efficient operation. These include the cooling system and hydrogen- and air subsystems. The compact layout ensures the entire drivetrain delivers the levels of performance and safety for which BMW is renowned.\n\nPrototype production is currently focused on development and validation of the assembly and testing processes, with particular attention paid to industrialisation, quality assurance and scalability in the longer term. In parallel to this, the prototypes are being used to develop operating strategy and for validation on both a system and vehicle level. These steps are crucial in preparing fuel cell technology for series production.\n\nSeries production at BMW Group Plant Steyr\n\nProduction of the fuel cell systems is due to get underway in 2028 at BMW Group Plant Steyr, which can call on decades of development and production expertise covering all drive system types across the BMW Group model range. New test rigs and production facilities are now being built and buildings modified to incorporate the new drive technology and constantly refine it.\n\n“We are proud to be producing another innovative drive technology at Plant Steyr in future alongside the latest generation of electric motors and combustion engines,” says Klaus von Moltke, Senior Vice President Engine Production at BMW AG and Director of BMW Group Plant Steyr. “This, together with the development expertise we have available on-site, makes our plant a prime example of the BMW Group’s technology-open approach.”\n\nComponent manufacture at BMW Group Plant Landshut\n\nBMW Group Plant Landshut is responsible for manufacturing key components for the fuel cell vehicles. Construction of new hardware and equipment for series production of the hydrogen-specific BMW Energy Master will start there in late May 2026. The BMW Energy Master controls the supply of power in the vehicle across a range from 400 – 800V. It also acts as the interface for data from the high-voltage battery. This control unit is supplemented by various components that are specifically required for the fuel cell application. Production of the first prototypes of the hydrogen-specific Energy Master will begin in mid-2026 just a few miles away at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, where the prototypes of the BMW Energy Master for the Neue Klasse models were also made.\n\nAs with the BMW iX5 Hydrogen pilot fleet, Plant Landshut will once again manufacture the housing and pressure plate for the next model generation."}

In addition to its emission-free electric drive, the BMW Motorrad Vision CE's standout features include the elimination of the need for a helmet as well as protective clothing, offering riders an increased sense of freedom and a casual, carefree riding experience. Setting new standards, the Vision CE offers an emotional, creative and fresh take on commuting, describing the future of urban two-wheel mobility.\n\nIn line with the BMW Group's sustainability strategy, BMW Motorrad is committed to rethinking urban electromobility constantly - making it emission-free, innovative and featuring ground-breaking designs. Back in 2014, BMW Motorrad became the first premium manufacturer to combine outstanding design with an electric drive in the BMW C evolution. The BMW CE 04, a design and technology masterpiece of emission-free urban mobility, was finally launched on the market in 2022. To this day, the CE 04 is the global market leader in its segment. Another highlight followed in 2024 with the BMW CE 02, which is also electric and symbolises a completely new style of mobility that is unique and extremely casual.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, BMW Motorrad revolutionised urban mobility with the BMW C1, a scooter that, thanks to its sophisticated safety bodywork, made it possible to dispense with helmets and the usual protective clothing. The BMW Motorrad Vision CE builds on this fundamental design philosophy, presenting it in a new interpretation with an emotional design language to create a unique, forward-looking vision vehicle.\n\nThe centrepiece of the BMW Motorrad Vision CE is its safety concept: a metal tube composite known as the 'cage'. Together with an appropriate seat construction with seat belt, it ensures a safe and emotional riding experience without the need for a helmet or the usual protective clothing.\n\nThe cage's reduced overall height and open, airy design, combined with a long wheelbase, give the Vision CE a stretched, dynamic and visually light appearance. The open use of coated aluminium adds an exclusive technical touch. The combination of the basic colour matt white and the contrasting colour black gives the Vision CE a clear, reduced and sculptural appearance. This innovative design and colour scheme is complemented by an elegant matt seat bench with integrated lettering and neon red accents on the graphics and other highlighted details.\n\nAnother highlight of the Vision CE is its balancing function, which allows the vehicle to completely balance itself when stationary.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad Vision CE redefines urban riding fun on two wheels, thanks to its unique cage design that eliminates the need for a helmet or protective clothing. The differently designed derivatives emphasise the versatility of this vision vehicle."}

They’ve done it again. ROWE Racing and the driver trio Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) have claimed their second endurance race victory of the season at the Nürburgring (GER). Following their triumph at the 24-hour race in June, the team and drivers also secured victory with the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the three-hour race of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS Endurance Cup. Additional podium finishes went to AlManar Racing by WRT in the Gold Cup and Century Motorsport in the Silver Cup .\n\nFarfus started from pole position and confidently defended the lead during his first stint. After the first pit stops, the car dropped to second place, but a later second stop and a fortuitous yellow flag brought final driver Marciello back to the front from where he confidently maintained the lead until the finish. The #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO crew from Team WRT had a disappointing day. Ugo de Wilde, Charles Weerts (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) set the fastest time in qualifying but received a five position grid penalty due to a collision. In the race, the crew lacked the necessary pace to keep up with the leaders and finished only in eleventh place overall, which meant ninth place in the Pro Cup.\n\nThere were additional podium finishes to celebrate for the BMW M Motorsport teams in the Gold and Silver Cups. The #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from AlManar Racing by WRT, driven by Jens Klingmann (GER), Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA), and Ben Tuck (GBR), finished second in the Gold Cup. Century Motorsport secured third place in the Silver category with the #42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO and drivers Mex Jansen (NED), William Moore (GBR), and Jarrod Waberski (RSA). Fifth and sixth places in the Silver Cup went to Paradine Competition and Team WRT, respectively. In the Bronze Cup, BMW Italia Ceccato Racing finished eighth. The #991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paradine Competition retired following an unavoidable collision.\n\nComments after the race.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Congratulations to ROWE Racing on another fantastic triumph at the Nürburgring! I fondly remember our celebration after the victory at the 24-hour race in June. That was one of the absolute highlights of the season. Now, standing on the top step of the podium on the Grand Prix circuit is a very strong achievement. Thank you to everyone for their hard work! Congratulations also to the winning drivers Augusto Farfus, Jesse Krohn, and Raffaele Marciello, as well as to AlManar Racing by WRT and Century Motorsport for their additional podium finishes with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. It’s unfortunate that things didn’t go well for the Team WRT #32 crew. This is a setback in the title race, but we still have one event left in both the Endurance and Sprint Cups and still have every chance. We will analyse the Nürburgring results together and come back stronger for the Valencia and Barcelona races.\"\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal, ROWE Racing): \"Two consecutive wins at the Nürburgring after our triumph at the 24-hour race – that’s impressive! The drivers and team delivered an outstanding performance and had an almost perfect weekend. Qualifying went well, and we were consistently strong in the race. Although we temporarily lost the lead, our strategy to make the final stop later and potentially benefit from a yellow flag paid off. We’ve come back strong after the summer break and are looking forward to the season finale at Barcelona.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 1st place): \"The Nürburgring has been very kind to us this season! A win on the short track and one on the long circuit – that puts a smile on our faces. Huge compliments to ROWE Racing! We were competitive from the first practice session and rewarded ourselves with first place. Now it’s time to celebrate.\"\n\nJesse Krohn (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 1st place): \"This is a big win for the team at its home race and also for me. Expectations were high after our 24-hour race victory, but we all did a great job together and achieved the perfect result. I’ll remember this win for a long time. Thank you to the entire team and BMW M Motorsport.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 1st place): \"It was a very good day. We were very strong and showed good pace in the race, even though we temporarily lost the lead due to strategy. We managed to regain it. In recent years, BMW M Motorsport hasn’t been as strong on the Grand Prix circuit of the Nürburgring in the GT World Challenge Europe. It’s great to have changed that now.\"\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 11th place): \"We lost quite a bit of time during practice and were therefore a bit on the back foot at the start. However, we made a great comeback with the fastest time in qualifying. Unfortunately, we received a grid penalty for the incident with the Mercedes. In my opinion, he crossed my line, but it is what it is. Even from sixth place, we still had every chance in the race, but for some reason, we just didn’t have the pace. Now we need to investigate why that happened and do better next time. Congratulations to ROWE Racing and the #98 crew on their victory.\"\n\nJens Klingmann (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT, 2nd place Gold Cup): \"We can be proud of second place in the Gold Cup. I don’t think more was possible today. The track was very slippery, which made it quite difficult for all of us. But we secured another podium and lots of points for the championship. We’re happy with that.\"\n\nMex Jansen (#42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Century Motorsport, 3rd place Silver Cup): \"I’m super happy with our performance and third place. The race was chaotic at times with lots of battles, but we fought our way forward. Now we have every chance to win the Silver Cup title at the Barcelona finale. Let’s go get it!\""}

The 2025 Goodwood Revival (12-14 September) will showcase five rolling sculptures of the legendary BMW Art Car series as part of the event’s Earls Court Motor Show. For the past 50 years, the BMW Art Car Collection has continued to evolve and features designs by some of the world’s most renowned artists, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Jeff Koons, and David Hockney.\n\nSince 1975, the BMW Group has provided artists with a playground for their fascination with automobiles through the BMW Art Cars: art and design, technology and innovation, racing and engineering. The collection of 20 BMW Art Cars now forms the essence of the global cultural engagement with over a hundred initiatives in the fields of contemporary art, music, film and design. Since its invention almost 140 years ago, artists around the world have engaged with the automobile in both critical and euphoric ways.\n\nThe exhibition at Goodwood Revival is part of the ongoing BMW Art Car World Tour, which celebrates the 50th aniversary of the collection by showcasing the legendary BMW Art Cars across various art and automotive platforms worldwide. The following five cars will be making a stop at the Revival Event:\n\n1976 I Frank Stella BMW 3.0 CSL Known for its participation in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the original BMW 3.0 CSL was reimagined by artist Frank Stella. As the second vehicle in the BMW Art Cars collection, Stella’s design was inspired by the technical basis of the car itself. The result was a striking composition of black and white lines, with the powerful 750 hp engine front and centre of the design.\n\n1977 I Roy Lichtenstein BMW 320i Turbo Just one year later, pop artist Roy Lichtenstein brought his signature style to life by incorporating his recognisable “Ben Day dots” into the design of the BMW 320i Turbo. The original vehicle, which also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, was driven by the founder of the art car collection Hervé Poulain and Marcel Mignot.\n\n1982 I Ernst Fuchs BMW 635 CSi Number five in the collection, the BMW 635 CSi was designed by Austrian artist Ernst Fuchs in 1982. Otherwise known as the “Fire Fox on a Hare Hunt”, Fuchs’ design was the first in the collection to be based on a production car, and varied from his earlier pieces of artwork.\n\n1995 I David Hockney BMW 850 CSi David Hockney designed the 14th car in the collection: the BMW 850 CSi. The result of an extended design project, Hockney aimed to reveal the car’s inner workings and spirit through his art. His detailed paintwork includes the outline of a driver on the door, while attentive viewers will note a stylised suction vent on the button - subtle touches which invite you to look closer at the design.\n\n2010 I Jeff Koons BMW M3 GT2 American artist Jeff Koons brought a dynamic palette of vibrant, contrasting colours to his BMW M3 GT2. The 17th BMW Art Car saw the return of Pop Art and the creation of a design which captures the essence of power and motion - conveying a sense of speed and energy even when the car is stationary.\n\nThe unique collection of cars will be on display across the Goodwood Revival weekend in Earls Court, as part of the collection's ongoing world tour.\n\nSaturday tickets for the Goodwood Revival are now sold out, with limited Friday and Sunday tickets remaining at goodwood.com\n\nThe Goodwood Revival Friday 12 – Sunday 14 September 2025.

A new record for the sales of electrified vehicles from the BMW Group has been set: With the handover of a 3 Series plug-in hybrid model from the Munich plant to a customer, BMW has sold its three millionth vehicle with an electrified drive. This milestone was achieved through a significant increase in sales of fully electric models and plug-in hybrid models in the first half of 2025.\n\n\"With the delivery of the three millionth electrified vehicle, the BMW Group has reached another important milestone that underlines the fact that electrified vehicles are an elementary component of our technology-neutral product portfolio. Furthermore, more than one in four BMW Group vehicles sold in the first half of 2025 was already electrified”, says Jochen Goller, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG Customer, Brands, Sales.\n\nEurope is by far the largest market for electrified vehicles from the BMW Group.

If all 1.5 million fully electric vehicles delivered by the BMW Group since the launch of the BMW i3 were lined up, they would stretch over 6,500 kilometers, roughly the distance from Munich to New York City.\n\nThe corporate strategy is consistently focused on electric, digital, and circular mobility for the future. Customers can currently choose from more than 15 fully electric models across all group brands, as well as more than ten plug-in hybrids.

BMW is partner of Frieze Seoul 2025: From 3 to 6 September, the art fair will bring 120 galleries from 30 countries to the COEX in the Gangnam district. Two anniversaries of the BMW Group will be celebrated with a multifaceted collaboration with renowned Korean artist Lee Kun-Yong: 30 years of BMW Korea and 50 years of the BMW Art Car Collection. Another highlight of this year's programme is the third edition of Frieze Music Seoul on 5 September, featuring a live performance by Korean RnB artist Crush, organised in collaboration with BMW. BMW will once again provide a shuttle service for VIP guests at the fair.\n\nLee Kun-Yong, born in 1942 in Sariwon (now North Korea), is considered one of Korea's most influential avant-garde artists. His thoughts on painting focus on the process, and the figurative becomes a medium through the performative use of Lee's body. His iconic ‘Bodyscape’ series consists of repetitive, precise gestures that depict the movement of the body in space on the canvas, creating abstract worlds from the artist's physical traces. Lee Kun-Yong was a co-founder of the experimental artist group ‘Space & Time,’ which developed into a core formation of the Korean avant-garde. He has expanded the boundaries of artistic expression through experiments with abstraction, performance, and the use of the human body as a medium and message.\n\nFor his collaboration with BMW, Lee Kun-Yong has designed a unique wrap for the fully electric BMW i7, which will be exhibited at Frieze Seoul. He has further developed his ‘Bodyscapes’ series for this purpose, transforming the vehicle into a mobile canvas that not only moves through space but also embodies it. Engaging with the design and technology of the BMW i7, Lee Kun-Yong's work reflects the precision and responsiveness inherent in the dialogue between driver and car, drawing parallels to his own artistic practice. By exploring the driving experience through various perspectives, he artfully creates a dynamic interplay of figurative and monochrome areas, evoking a sense of proximity and distance. \"I firmly believe that art can be the bridge between different objects, different people and even different perspectives,\" says Lee Kun-Yong. \"Through this new collaboration, I hope to create new encounters and connections through art, and I am excited to see how this link between art and technology will develop.\"\n\nOn 4 September at 1 p.m., Lee Kun-Yong will give one of his iconic live performances, creating one new canvas. Inspired by his work on the BMW i7, he translates his thoughts on mobility, time and space into physical expression: for him, movement is not just speed. It is perception, interaction with the environment and the intimate dialogue between body and machine.\n\nIn 2025, BMW celebrates 50 years of BMW Art Cars with a global exhibition programme and diverse artistic initiatives – the BMW Art Car World Tour. Since 1975, the BMW Group has provided artists with a playground for their fascination with automobiles through the BMW Art Cars: art and design, technology and innovation, racing and engineering. The collection of 20 BMW Art Cars now forms the essence of the global cultural engagement with over a hundred initiatives in the fields of contemporary art, music, film and design. Since its invention almost 140 years ago, artists around the world have engaged with the automobile in both critical and euphoric ways. The BMW Art Car series contributes significantly to this inspiring dialogue and is an anchor point for further unique artistic collaborations on vehicles, such as the one with Lee Kun-Yong. In addition to the BMW i7, miniatures of 18 BMW Art Cars from the collection are on display in the BMW Lounge as historical references.\n\nThe collaboration with Lee Kun-Yong is already the third large-scale artistic initiative at Frieze Seoul and testifies to BMW Korea's deep-rooted commitment to innovation, future orientation and emotional experiences. Since its foundation in 1995, the company has had a large presence in South Korea – including the Incheon Cheongna Development Centre and the Driving Centre on Yeongjong Island. South Korea is the BMW Group's fifth-largest market, and in 2023 and 2024, BMW ranked first among imported automotive brands. BMW Korea will celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2025 with numerous events under the motto ‘Joy of Driving. Innovation for Tomorrow.’\n\nFrieze MusicTo celebrate their long-standing partnership, BMW and Frieze are jointly presenting another edition of Frieze Music in Seoul. Crush will perform on 5 September. Since releasing his debut single in 2012, he has established himself as one of Korea’s most innovative artists – a multi-talented performer and producer blending pop, R&B, and hip hop. Frieze Music explores the intersection between music and art to create a space for dialogue.

The third-to-last race weekend of the DTM season at the Sachsenring (GER) proved to be the anticipated major challenge for Schubert Motorsport and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. However, both the team and drivers Marco Wittmann and René Rast (both GER) delivered impressive comebacks in both races, collecting valuable points in the title fight. Wittmann finished seventh and fifth, while Rast finished 14th on Saturday and sixth in Sunday’s race.\n\nThe Saturday race was marked by a heavy rain shower that hit the Sachsenring during the starting grid formation, turning the first half of the race into a water battle. Wittmann drove a flawless race in the #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, improving from 12th on the grid to finish seventh on a drying track. Rast had to settle for 14th place. On Sunday, with better weather, the starting positions looked bleak as Rast and Wittmann qualified only 18th and 19th. However, both delivered outstanding performances in the race. Wittmann gained 14 positions to finish fifth, while Rast climbed 12 places to finish sixth.\n\nThanks in part to mistakes by competitors, who lost many points due to crashes and penalties, both drivers remain realistic title contenders with four races left in the season. Rast is seventh in the standings, 21 points behind the leader, while Wittmann is ninth, 29 points back. In the team standings, Schubert Motorsport is third with 245 points. The next race weekend takes place on 13th/14th September at the Red Bull Ring (AUT), where Schubert Motorsport has won two of the last four races.\n\nADAC GT4 Germany: One-two finish for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. As in DTM, the Sunday race in the ADAC GT4 Germany was also significantly more successful for BMW M Motorsport than Saturday’s race. The BMW M4 GT4 EVO celebrated a one-two finish. FK Performance Motorsport triumphed with Gabriele Piana (ITA) and BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler (TUR). Linus Hahne and Thomas Rackl (both GER) from Team ME Motorsport completed the one-two finish. ME Motorsport also secured fourth place. In Saturday’s race, three BMW M4 GT4 EVOs finished in sixth, seventh, and eighth. With their victory, Piana and Besler reduced their gap to the championship leaders to ten points. Like in DTM, four races remain in the ADAC GT4 Germany season.\n\nComments on the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"A fantastic team effort by Schubert Motorsport on a weekend full of surprises. We knew the Sachsenring would be a challenge for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, but we didn’t expect to qualify so far back – especially on Sunday. The comebacks in the races by Marco Wittmann and René Rast were all the more impressive, with flawless performances and strong pit stops helping to secure valuable points. Thanks to the solid results and our competitors’ mistakes, the title fight is still wide open. We now head to the Red Bull Ring and the finale at Hockenheim fully motivated. In the ADAC GT4 Germany, our teams and drivers delivered great results in Sunday’s race. Congratulations to FK Performance Motorsport and ME Motorsport on the one-two finish with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO! It was the perfect response to a disappointing result on Saturday.\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal, Schubert Motorsport): \"If someone had told me before the weekend that our drivers wouldn’t lose any points to the championship leaders at the Sachsenring, I would have taken it immediately. Given the circumstances, we can be very satisfied with the results. In Sunday’s race, we opted for different strategies. Marco had fresher tyres than René at the end and was able to pass him. In the team standings, the Manthey team has pulled ahead, but I hope we’ll have the chance to close the gap at the Red Bull Ring, a track where we’ve traditionally been strong.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 7th place, R2: 5th place): \"Two great races with maximum damage control. Especially on Sunday, it was hard to imagine that we could climb from 19th on the grid to finish fifth. We chose a slightly different strategy than many others and started on a used set of tyres, which gave us better tyres at the end compared to the competition. The race was wild, with lots of battles and contacts, but we came through it really well. Unfortunately, we’re currently struggling to qualify further up the field, which makes the races more difficult. But as a team and as drivers, we’re not making mistakes, and that’s our advantage compared to our competitors.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 14th place, R2: 6th place): \"Our points haul here at the Sachsenring was good in terms of the championship. Finishing sixth on Sunday from so far back on the grid feels like a victory. The title fight is still open, but overall, it was a tough weekend for us. We didn’t have the pace to think about winning, but that should be the goal. The title fight is intense, and mistakes are being made. So, for us, it’s about staying cool and doing our job.\""}

The high-voltage battery is a vital component of every electric vehicle. With the high-voltage batteries for the sixth generation (Gen6) of BMW eDrive, the BMW Group has made a big step in technology, delivering major improvements in energy density, charging speed and range. In readiness for series production, the BMW Group is currently building five assembly sites across three continents: in Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). Before the series launch, production processes will be developed and tested at the BMW Group’s pilot plants for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf and Hallbergmoos, and at the Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich. As a data scientist and IT project manager, Patrick Zimmermann is responsible for implementing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and data analytics in the high-voltage battery production of the BMW Group. His role is to weave all relevant software strands together.\n\nPatrick, what do you do as a data scientist and IT project manager in high-voltage battery production?\n\nPatrick Zimmermann (PZ): I coordinate an interdisciplinary team that oversees the entire data processing chain: from data provision at the manufacturing facilities to edge applications that transfer our production data to the cloud and to analytics platforms.\n\nWhat kind of expertise do you need for that?\n\nPZ: First and foremost, the job requires a solid understanding of the technologies used to manufacture our high-voltage batteries. For this latest generation, which uses the new cylindrical round cells, we’ve developed a completely new production process. Of course, strong IT knowledge is also essential – with a clear focus on the software architectures behind the data analytics and artificial intelligence. Understanding the individual software modules and interfaces is crucial for choosing the right solutions for our production from the wide range of technologies and applications available.\n\nThis means you always have your finger on the pulse and can anticipate IT trends?\n\nPZ: Data analytics and AI for production are evolving at a tremendous pace right now. That's why it’s important to keep an eye on new approaches and evaluate whether they’re suitable for BMW. Or whether they could even replace existing solutions – perhaps by offering lower costs or enhanced features. Not every analysis or AI solution that performs well in a particular industry or use case can be directly applied to battery production.\n\nProduction of Gen6 high-voltage batteries is groundbreaking for the BMW Group. What, in your opinion, makes this project unique?\n\nPZ: One unique aspect is the end-to-end responsibility – from data provision and data transfer to the cloud, all the way through to selective and even continuous analyses. We process both numerical data and visual representations from the equipment. Throughout the process, we maintain a consistent zero-defect approach to producing our high-voltage batteries. Highly intelligent, AI-supported quality checks are integrated into the production process to help us achieve this. We rely on OPC UA interface technology for plant connectivity. This enables us to model standardised digital twins directly at our plants, eliminating the need for additional data processing. Data is transferred to the BMW Group's clouds, using the same data structure across all production sites. This allows us to roll out standardised analysis dashboards worldwide and, for example, implement process optimisations more rapidly. We’ve already established this IT architecture at our high-voltage battery pilot plants. We have now been able to transfer our analysis dashboards to the first series production plants with minimal effort.\n\nEntire new plants and assembly halls are being built for production of the new Gen6 high-voltage batteries. Is this beneficial for the IT structure?\n\nPZ: Absolutely! Building several plants for Gen6 high-voltage batteries on greenfield sites gives us a whole new level of design freedom. This allows for much bigger leaps in IT, compared to integrating new solutions into existing plants – a so-called brownfield. I, for one, find it really exciting to help shape the Industrial Internet of Things and data analytics on such a large scale right from the start.\n\nINFOBOX: How the BMW Group builds Gen6 high-voltage batteries\n\nWith its innovative production processes, BMW Group’s pilot and series plants are setting new industry standards for battery production. Examples include, among the consistent zero-defect approach, the use of digital production twins for tasks such as employee training, as well as leveraging expanded AI databases to optimise supply and production logistics. All production steps undergo seamless in-line monitoring with comprehensive data storage, enabling maximum process stability and continuous data-based optimisation.\n\nThe BMW Group sources battery cells for its high-voltage batteries from leading cell manufacturers, who produce the cells to the company's specifications. The highest technical standards apply. Upon receipt of goods, additional measurements – such as voltage checks – are carried out. Next comes cell clustering, where the battery cells are connected to coolants. This step ensures optimal insulation and cooling of the cells. The cell clusters and cell contact system are then laser-cleaned and welded with pinpoint precision. The in-line inspection continuously monitors each weld seam in real time. An innovative foaming process follows, ensuring that all elements are protected as a mechanical unit. The foam thus guarantees the safety, stability and durability of the high-voltage battery. The housing is then closed, sealed and riveted. In the final assembly step, the Energy Master – the central control unit – is installed onto the high-voltage battery. A permanently elastic sealing adhesive is applied to ensure a reliable seal. Finally, each high-voltage battery undergoes a 100% end-of-line inspection to ensure quality, safety and function."}

Robert MacIntyre (SCO) had topped the leaderboard for three days at the BMW Championship, but the final standings had a very familiar look as world no. 1 Scottie Scheffler celebrated his victory. The 29-year-old once more showed his class and performed consistently, reaching the clubhouse at the challenging Caves Valley Golf Club after posting four excellent rounds (66, 65, 67, 67 strokes) on the par-70 course. Scotland’s MacIntyre (-13) finished second, ahead of Maverick McNealy (USA, -11). Tommy Fleetwood (ENG) and Sam Burns (USA, both -10) shared fourth place.\n\n“Each year, The BMW Championship only gets better,” said Sebastian Mackensen, President and CEO, BMW of North America. “On Saturday, Akshay Bhatia won a 100% electric BMW iX M70 and triggered our donation of the seventh BMW Championship Hole-in-One Scholarship thanks to his hole-in-one on 17. And on Sunday, we watched the conclusion of an incredible battle between Robert MacIntyre and Scottie Scheffler. A big congratulations to Scottie on his victory, and thank you to all our partners, the players, fans, volunteers, and community members who make this event possible.”\n\nMacIntyre had carded a course-record 62 on Thursday to move into the lead and started the final day four strokes ahead of Scheffler, but was unable to maintain that form on Sunday. The 29-year-old was only able to birdie the 16th hole, but recorded four bogeys as the day progressed. While Scheffler did not produced a perfect performance, he claimed birdies on a regular basis and captutred the outright lead at the 7th hole. The American golfer conjured up some brilliance at the 17th hole (par 3), holing a magical 25-metre chip from the rough for a birdie that confirmed his victory.\n\nThis win sees Scheffler retain the lead in the season’s rankings for the PGA TOUR. At next week’s Tour Championship, he could become the first player to mount a successful defence of the FedExCup. Rory McIlroy (NIR, -3, T12), J.J. Spaun (USA, +1, T23), Justin Rose (ENG, +4, T30) and Fleetwood round off the top 5 in these standings.\n\nThere were two reasons to celebrate during the third round when American golfer Aksay Bhatia produced a hole-in-one at the 17th hole (par 3). The 23-year-old was rewarded with the keys to this year’s Hole-in-One Car, the new all-electric BMW iX M70. BMW also donates a full scholarship to the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF) of tournament organiser Western Golf Association for the first ace at the BMW Championship, a prize worth $125,000.\n\n“It warms my heart that I can give an opportunity to a kid who will have a full scholarship next year. That’s a blessing, and the impact of the Evans Scholars Foundation and the BMW Championship cannot be overstated,” said Bhatia after his sensational shot. This marks the seventh time in tournament history that BMW has donated an Evans Scholarship for the first ace at the BMW Championship. The Hole-in-One Car, however, had only been awarded twice before. Jason Day (AUS, BMW M760i) in 2017 and Hunter Mahan (USA, BMW i3) in 2013 both made their aces when it counted.\n\nThe commitment to education plays a pivotal role at the BMW Championship, as all proceeds from the tournament benefit the ESF. Since the inaugural BMW Championship in 2007, the tournament has raised more than $60 million (not including this year’s event) and helped award more than 4,000 full tuition and housing college scholarships for caddies. At the start of the tournament week, Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Places, visited the University of Maryland for the inauguration of the new “Caves Valley Golf Club Evans Scholarship House”, where 38 caddies will have the opportunity to study and live on campus free of charge.\n\n“The BMW Group believes that sports and education form the foundation for equal opportunities and social participation – and the Evans Scholars Foundation is a marvellous initiative working precisely in this direction,” said Ilka Horstmeier at the opening ceremony. The empowering force of education is the key to a self-determined future. We are proud of our longstanding partnership with the Western Golf Association”\n\nThe BMW Championship 2025 was also the final tournament at which American players were able to score qualification points for the Ryder Cup team led by captain Keegan Bradley. Scheffler, J.J. Spaun and Xander Schauffele had already secured their spots ahead of the BMW Championship and they were joined on Sunday by Russell Henley, Harris English and Bryson DeChambeau. Bradley will name his six wild cards after the Tour Championship.\n\nThe six players who qualify directly for the team representing defending champions Europe will be confirmed at the same time. European captain Luke Donald (ENG) will reveal his six Captain’s Picks one week later, allowing the final line-up for Team Europe to appear together at the BMW PGA Championship (9-14 September, Wentworth Club, London, ENG). BMW has been supporting the flagship tournament on the DP World Tour as title partner since 2005, and will be Worldwide Partner for the Ryder Cup (23rd-28th September 2025, Bethpage Black Course near New York, USA) for the third time."}

For the ace, the 23-year-old American was rewarded with this year’s Hole-in-One Prize, the new all-electric BMW iX M70. The BMW Group’s flagship technology model impresses with up to 25% increased power output, significantly improved efficiency, and a maximum range of 701 kilometers in the WLTP cycle.\n\nThe ace on the 17th was Bhatia’s second eagle of the day, having already holed out with his second shot on the 7th hole. While the two-time PGA TOUR winner was thrilled about the BMW iX, the eagles were also crucial for his scorecard: Bhatia is ranked 29th in the FedExCup standings and is fighting for a spot in next week’s season finale, which is reserved for the top 30 players.\n\nHowever, the Hole-in-One holds even greater significance for a caddie, as BMW donates a full scholarship to the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF) for the first ace at the BMW Championship, enabling a young person to pursue higher education. “We are proud of our long-standing partnership with the Western Golf Association and the tremendous impact the BMW Championship has had on the lives of so many young scholars.

I am delighted that today’s ace adds another scholarship to this legacy.”\n\nBhatia commented: “The BMW is, of course, a fantastic bonus. Beyond that, the two eagles I made today are really good for what I need to do for tomorrow. But most importantly, it warms my heart that I can give an opportunity to a kid who will have a full scholarship next year.

The Hole-in-One Prize, however, has only been awarded twice before. Jason Day (AUS) in 2017 and Hunter Mahan (USA) in 2013 were the lucky winners. Both players made their valuable aces on the 17th hole at Conway Farms Golf Club (Chicago). In 2013, Mahan received an all-electric BMW i3, while Day donated the value of his Hole-in-One Car – a BMW M760i – to the Evans Scholars Foundation."}

Julie Mehretu’s BMW Art Car will travel on to The Bridge.\n\nAndy Warhol's BMW M1 Group 4 (#4, 1979)Andy Warhol (1928–1987) is considered one of the most influential artists of the modern age and a major proponent of Pop Art. In just 28 minutes, Warhol covered the car – then the latest masterpiece by design legend Giorgio Giugiaro – in colours and textures that clearly reveal his artistic gestures, even today. Hervé Poulain, the founder of the BMW Art Car Collection, witnessed Warhol painting the car and compared it to a live dance performance. Andy Warhol’s Art Car was raced for the first and only time at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979.\n\nJulie Mehretu's BMW M Hybrid V8 (#20, 2024)Mixed media, print, painting: Julie Mehretu’s works comment on social and political upheavals. Born in 1970 in Addis Ababa and now living in New York, Mehretu is one of the most successful artistic voices of her generation. She first presented her artistically designed BMW M Hybrid V8 to the public at the Centre Pompidou in Paris in May 2024. After its race deployment in Le Mans a month later, this year marks the next chapter of the project in cooperation with the BMW Group: the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC). With BMW Art Car #20 now returning to the artist's homeland for the first time, the presentation at Pebble Beach marks its North American premiere.\n\nAt the 74th Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance (17 August 2025), the signature event of Monterey Car Week, art buffs and motorsport fans alike will be treated to a rare display of these two spectacular examples from BMW’s storied collection.\n\nThis year’s event serves as the perfect venue to celebrate two American-made masterpieces, as 2025 marks the 50th anniversaries of the BMW Art Car collection and BMW officially doing business in the USA. The ‘rolling sculpture’ by Julie Mehretu will then continue its journey to The Bridge in Bridgehampton, New York.\n\nIn 2016, Bob Rubin, Shamin Abas, and Jeffrey Einhorn founded The Bridge, one of the nation’s most exclusive annual automotive events, held by invitation only on the historic grounds of the original Bridgehampton Race Circuit. The event celebrates the site’s rich racing heritage, showcasing over 200 post-war sports and competition cars. This year, visitors can look forward to a special highlight on 13 September 2025: Julie Mehretu's BMW Art Car #20 will be on display alongside the McLaren Artura GT4 designed by American artist Mickalene Thomas. Inspired by the idea behind the BMW Art Car Collection, the Driven Artists Racing Team (DART Car)commissioned award-winning multidisciplinary artist Mickalene Thomas to design a custom wrap for their very first race car, the McLaren Artura GT4. The car made its official debut on February 18th at the Classic Car Club Manhattan in New York. The DART initiative was founded by entrepreneur Zoë Barry, art advisor Spring McManus, and professional racecar driver Aurora Straus. It aims to showcase the achievements of women in the traditionally male-dominated fields of art and motorsport.\n\nAs part of the presentation of BMW Art Car #20 by Julie Mehretu and Mickalene Thomas' custom-designed McLaren, an Art Talk with Julie Mehretu, entrepreneur Zoë Barry and Thomas Girst, Global Head of BMW Group Cultural Engagement, will take place on 13 September at 4pm. The conversation, moderated by art advisor Spring McManus, explores the innovative fusion of contemporary art and motorsports.\n\nThe BMW Art Car Collection.The BMW Art Car initiative came from French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, who, together with then BMW Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, asked his artist friend Alexander Calder to paint a car. The result was a completely reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which went on to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975 and became a crowd favorite. In the years that followed, art icons like Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, and Julie Mehretu have enriched the collection, each in their own individual style.\n\nThe BMW vehicles that have been turned into works of art using a wide variety of graphic and artistic techniques are as different as the artists themselves – from pure racing thoroughbreds to production vehicles and rare sports cars. The results are all vastly different. No two vehicles are alike. BMW Art Car artists are selected by an independent worldwide jury of museum directors and curators, and the artist always maintains complete creative freedom throughout the entire process.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}

In addition to featuring a state-of-the-art living and learning environment, the facility has the capacity to house 38 scholars. The foundation for this project was laid during the 2021 BMW Championship, which also took place at the Caves Valley Golf Club. Four years ago, this initiative was brought into focus, and through the collaboration of all parties involved, it was successfully realized in such a short time.\n\n“This Scholarship House represents a tremendous opportunity not only for the 21 Evans Scholars who will attend Maryland this fall, but for generations of promising caddies to come,” said WGA Chairman Steve Colnitis. “Today marks the beginning of the next bright chapter for the Evans Scholars at the University of Maryland.”\n\nThis fall, a record 1,260 Evans Scholars will be enrolled at 27 leading universities nationwide. There are more than 12,500 Evans Scholars Alumni since the Program began in 1930.\n\nThe support of the ESF through the BMW Championship is part of the BMW Group global commitment in golf for equal opportunities. Through its “Eagles for Education” initiative, the BMW Group supports the Golf Foundation at the BMW PGA Championship (England) and the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education at the BMW International Open (Germany).

Second win of the season, 30th victory of his DTM career: René Rast (GER) had a fantastic Sunday at the fifth race weekend of the season at the Nürburgring (GER). Driving the #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, he stormed from sixth on the grid to the top, earning valuable points to rejoin the title race. Marco Wittmann (GER) already impressed on Saturday with a strong comeback drive, finishing fifth in the #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO. On Sunday, he started from seventh and finished second, completing the double victory for Schubert Motorsport.\n\nAfter a disappointing 14th place on Saturday, Rast seemed to be losing touch in the drivers’ standings. He had actually delivered a spectacular comeback drive from 17th on the grid to seventh, but a post-race time penalty following a collision on the first lap dropped him back. Thanks to his commanding victory on Sunday, Rast is now back in the title fight, sitting fourth in the overall standings with 117 points, just 20 points behind the leader. The 38-year-old took the lead from sixth on the grid during the first stint and steadily extended it on fresh tyres in the second stint.\n\nWittmann shone in both races. On Saturday, he climbed nine positions, finishing fifth after starting 14th. On Sunday, a perfect strategy and strong pit stops by the Schubert team secured him a podium finish. It was his second podium of the season, and he now sits seventh in the drivers’ standings with 101 points. Schubert Motorsport holds second place in the team standings with 213 points.\n\nADAC GT4 Germany: Victory and two podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. BMW M Motorsport teams also celebrated podium finishes at the Nürburgring weekend in the ADAC GT4 Germany. On Sunday, Gabriele Piana (ITA) and BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler (TUR) secured the first win of the season for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO and the FK Performance Motorsport team. The duo claimed a commanding victory from second on the grid. On Saturday, Piana and Besler finished fourth – directly behind two other BMW M4 GT4 EVOs. Thomas Rackl and Linus Hahne (both GER), along with Tim Reiter and Phillip Wiskirchen (both GER), completed a double podium for Team ME Motorsport by finishing second and third. Rackl and Hahne confirmed their strong form with a fourth-place finish on Sunday.\n\nStatements after the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “A fantastic weekend at the Nürburgring is behind our BMW M Motorsport teams. Schubert Motorsport shone on Sunday with their second one-two finish of the season after Zandvoort, re-entering the title fight in both the drivers’ and team standings after a challenging Saturday race. Equally impressive are the results in the ADAC GT4 Germany. I am absolutely thrilled about the victory for Gabriele Piana and our BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler on Sunday – marking the first win of the season for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO in this series. Alongside FK Performance Motorsport, ME Motorsport also had reason to celebrate on the podium. Getting both cars onto the podium on Saturday was an outstanding achievement. Congratulations and a big thank you to everyone involved!”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “It was a weekend of highs and lows. Of course, we are absolutely thrilled about the one-two victory on Sunday, but unfortunately, on Saturday, we didn’t have the performance we needed and left important points on the table. On Sunday, both drivers were very happy with the cars and were able to work their way from strong starting positions all the way to the top. Looking at the championship, we scored a lot of points here, but we now need to keep fighting. The Sachsenring is coming up next, and it’s a track where we’ve struggled in the past.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 14th place, R2: 1st place): “The victory on Sunday is a fantastic way to wrap up the Nürburgring weekend. I already noticed during the formation lap that my BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt fantastic on the track and had incredible grip. As a result, I was able to attack right from the start of the race and secure a surprisingly commanding victory. I had hoped for a podium, but I didn’t expect the win. Unfortunately, we left some points on the table on Saturday, but thanks to Sunday’s results, I’m back in the title fight. Now it’s on to the Sachsenring, where we’ve traditionally faced some challenges. The goal there will be to maximise the points we can take.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 5th place, R2: 2nd place): “It was a very good weekend, and I’m really happy. Finishing fifth on Saturday from 14th on the grid was already an incredible comeback. Then to top it off today with second place after starting from seventh is fantastic. The team did an outstanding job with the strategy and pit stops, which were the keys to this success. Especially after the zero points at my home event at the Norisring, this weekend comes as a real relief.”"}

It was my target to ride a factory bike because I really want to fight for the World Championship title. So I think that this is the step that I needed to get in the position to achieve that goal. I can’t wait to join the team and I want to thank everyone at BMW and all those people at home who support me.

For example, Team WRT has put itself in a strong position thanks to a solid weekend in the GT World Challenge Europe at Magny-Cours. It’s always exciting to see how the team manages to get the most out of a race weekend, even under less-than-ideal conditions. That’s how championships are won – hopefully again this season! In North America, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M4 GT4 EVO once again made waves last weekend and two weeks prior.

BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad will present their new arrivals at two central locations during the IAA Mobility 2025 show, just like at the 2021 and 2023 editions of the event: The IAA Mobility Summit will take place at Munich’s exhibition centre (Messe München) – the BMW Group stand is in Hall A1 – and the BMW Group’s Open Space can be found at Max-Joseph-Platz square, under the gaze of the opera house. The generously proportioned Open Space, which covers an area of 3,000 m2, is open to visitors free of charge on Tuesday, 9 September (the official opening day) from 11.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. CET, on Wednesday, 10 September – Saturday, 13 September from 11.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m. CET and on Sunday, 14 September from 10.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. CET. BMW Welt and the BMW Museum will also be playing their part in the most important event of the year for the automotive and mobility sector with exhibitions and concepts of their own. The official opening of the IAA Mobility Summit will take place at the exhibition centre on Monday, 8 September at 8.00 a.m. CET. It is aimed primarily at trade visitors and is open every day until Friday, 12 September from 9.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. CET.\n\nThe BMW Group is presenting one of the most significant new vehicles in its history at IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich, its home city. The BMW iX3, the first Neue Klasse model, will celebrate its public unveiling at the event. Revealed at the same time will be new technologies that will play a revolutionary and trailblazing role across the BMW Group in the future. The new BMW iX3 gives the public their first glimpse of the huge technological leap forward made by BMW in many areas: electric mobility, display and control/operation, digitalisation, connectivity, design, sustainability and technological openness. All upcoming BMW models will benefit from the innovations in the Neue Klasse – regardless of the drive system type used to power them.\n\nAs BMW’s star of the IAA 2025, the new BMW iX3 will take centre stage event-wide. As well as the presentation of several examples of the global newcomer, the central stage in the shadow of Munich’s opera house at Max-Joseph-Platz will host daily “Masterclasses” featuring the new model. On each of the six days of the event, there will also be demonstrations of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive developed entirely in-house at BMW. These innovations from the BMW iX3 will likewise find their way into all future BMW models as part of a gradual process.\n\nA dedicated area of the Open Space will focus on BMW Charging, with the help of current BMW electric vehicles like the new BMW iX and the BMW i5. The assembled experts here will provide the low-down on both public charging and the BMW Charging offering for home charging using various BMW Wallboxes. BMW Charging will present the bidirectional charging available in the BMW iX3 for the first time at the IAA Mobility show. This technology allows the iX3 to feed energy from its high-voltage battery into the customer’s home power supply (Vehicle-to-Home – V2H) or the public grid (Vehicle-to-Grid – V2G).\n\nBMW Motorrad is presenting the BMW CE 02 and BMW CE 04 electric premium scooters – for electric mobility majoring in manoeuvrability – at the city-centre location. And with the BMW Motorrad Vision CE, the brand also offers a fascinating look ahead to how developers and designers are envisaging the future of fully electric scooters for the big city.\n\nMINI will spread its IAA Mobility 2025 presence across two locations in the heart of Munich. Its spectacular Open Space set at Max-Joseph-Platz and central brand appearance at the MINI Pavillon on Lenbachplatz will provide insights deep into the DNA of the brand. Plus, two eye-catching JCW show cars will celebrate their world premieres in Munich as part of a suitably gripping presentation. The Bavarian capital will turn into one huge stage for the iconic British brand during IAA Mobility 2025.\n\nThe JCW show cars will bring attention-grabbing presence to the MINI Pavillon and provide visual evidence of motor sport as a defining element of MINI DNA. The British icon and racing competition certainly go hand in hand, as confirmed most recently by the brand’s latest success in the Nürburgring 24-hour race. The show cars will be on display at Lenbachplatz for the duration of the IAA, locking into the spirit of a world-renowned fashion and lifestyle brand. The MINI Pavillon will be extensively refurbished for the occasion and dedicated entirely to the John Cooper Works sub-brand.\n\nIn 2025, as in previous years, the Family Area at the Open Space invites visitors to get involved and enjoy a spot of relaxation at the same time. Children, teenagers and families can look forward to creative attractions such as LEGO build areas, a Disney+ Dance Challenge with Lilo & Stitch, craft activities and a water station. Other highlights – e.g. on the roof terrace – only add to the richly varied family programme.\n\nExpanding on its star turn at the Open Space on Max-Joseph-Platz, the BMW iX3 also holds sway at the BMW Group’s 2,000 m2 stand in the exhibition centre – which is located in Riem, in the eastern part of Munich. Alongside the spread of vehicles on display here at the Summit, innovations including BMW Panoramic iDrive, sixth-generation eDrive technology, and driving dynamics management provided by the “Heart of Joy” high-performance computer will be front and centre of presentations and talks by experts. The most important elements of BMW Panoramic iDrive are the display surface spanning the full width of the lower windscreen, the new multifunction steering wheel with shy-tech technology, and the Central Display. All play their part in an impressive large-scale animation. The experts at the Summit will also shed light on areas such as fuel cells, alternative fuels, plug-in hybrid drive systems and charging technology.\n\nThe BMW Group’s stand at the exhibition centre will be showcasing a celebrity car from years past, as BMW Classic winds back the clock to a BMW 1500 from the 1960s – the first model in the original Neue Klasse line-up. The 1500 was the headline act at the 1961 IAA in Frankfurt, a genuine breakthrough star that wrote the opening lines for an international success story. The Neue Klasse laid the foundations for the BMW Group to become the world’s most successful maker of premium automobiles. And now the BMW iX3 of 2025 takes us full circle – a car with all the tools to build on this growth and the first model in another new era.\n\nAs well as its appearances at the Open Space in the city centre and the exhibition centre, the BMW iX3 will also be on show at BMW Welt in the north of Munich from 6 September. Under the spotlight here along with the new fully electric BMW model are innovations such as BMW Panoramic iDrive and services like BMW Charging. During the IAA, customers stopping to top up their vehicles at the BMW Welt charging stations will be treated to a refreshing surprise and, if desired, a free personal tour of all things BMW iX3 and BMW Charging.\n\nShortly before IAA Mobility 2025 opens to visitors, a new vehicle charging hub will go into service outside BMW Welt. The BMW Welt High-Power Charging station will provide eight charging points for electric vehicles. Created by Designworks, BMW’s innovation studio, the hub fits in neatly with the unique architecture of the overall building. Expert talks and presentations will accompany the introduction of the new charging facility from 8 September and continue throughout IAA Mobility 2025.\n\nThe BMW Museum will greet visitors to IAA Mobility 2025 with a new digital attraction: the BMW Museum DigiTour. This web-based app, which can be accessed without downloading, provides a modern, fascinating and interactive offering for the visitors from around the world. This new digital visitor experience brings the history and allure of the BMW brand to life. A highlights tour of classic BMWs (from the early days to the present day) will be presented here in digital form, as will shortly the Museum’s temporary exhibition “Belle Macchine – Italian Automotive Design at BMW.” Additional tours are planned, including options for families and kids. The BMW Museum DigiTour is free of charge, opens a window into rarely shown archive material and is available in several different languages.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: The figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, electric power consumption and range refer to vehicles in the German market. All figures are calculated based on the new WLTP test cycle. Fuel consumption and emissions data refers to the German Passenger Car Energy Labelling Regulation (PKW-EnVKV)."}

As it transitions from natural gas to renewable energy, the BMW Group is gradually electrifying its paint shops as part of its efforts to decarbonise vehicle production. A recently concluded pilot project at Plant Regensburg demonstrates how this transition can be simplified and accelerated. The key lies in the installation of a thermal oil system. Using thermal oil as a heat transfer medium enables heat generation to be decoupled from the rest of the system’s components. This allows the energy supply to the coating lines to be adapted flexibly at any time.\n\n“One advantage of switching to thermal oil is the flexibility to choose the energy source for heat generation in our paint shops. For example, thermal oil can be heated using electricity, geothermal energy, solar thermal energy – or even a hydrogen-powered heating system. The ability to change fuels quickly at any time makes our paint shops more resilient. If an energy source becomes scarce or unavailable, we can respond at short notice,” explains Samuel Flieger, project manager for technical planning in the Regensburg paint shop.\n\nThis means paint shops can already be set up to run on renewable energy – even if gas-free heating is not yet an option. The power grid is not currently equipped at all locations to handle the high energy demands of a fully electrified paint shop, largely due to its extremely energy-intensive drying processes. A thermal oil-based system can also be operated with gas as an interim solution.\n\nTesting successfully concluded in Regensburg\n\nThe Regensburg pilot project team took advantage of the production downtime over the New Year period to install the thermal oil technology. Within just a few days, they replaced the gas-powered drying equipment used for one of the three top coat lines with an electrically heated thermal oil system – complete with an innovative electric-powered eRTO exhaust air unit.\n\nThe key innovation lies in using the new electric heating unit to transfer heat to the thermal oil, instead of directly heating the air around the car bodies in the drying chamber after paint application. The heated oil circulates in a closed loop and, in a second step, heats the air in the drying chamber via heat exchangers. The circulating thermal oil reaches temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius. Unlike water, it remains stable even at these high temperatures.\n\nRetrofitting boosts energy efficiency\n\nWherever waste heat is generated, it is recovered and reused as process heat. This reduces the temperature of the exhaust air released through the hall's roof. As a result of these retrofitting measures, the drying equipment’s total energy consumption has been reduced by approximately 40 percent. Switching to thermal oil heating, combined with the system's improved energy efficiency, will reduce the carbon footprint of BMW Group Plant Regensburg’s paint shop by approximately 480 tons of CO2e per year.\n\nBMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf The BMW Group vehicle plant in Regensburg has been in operation since 1986 and is one of more than 30 BMW Group production locations worldwide. Every workday, around 1,400 vehicles of the BMW X1 and BMW X2 models roll off the production line at Plant Regensburg, destined for customers around the globe. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on a single production line – ranging from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models.\n\nBMW Group Plant Regensburg was recognised as “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 in the category “excellent large-series assembly” of the prestigious industrial competition. As it implements the so-called BMW iFACTORY, the BMW Group is focused on digitalisation of the Regensburg plant site to create a digital and intelligently connected factory. It is already possible to experience in virtual form what the factory will look like a few years from now. Production of models for the NEUE KLASSE, BMW’s next generation of vehicles, will ramp up in Regensburg in the second half of the decade.\n\nThe BMW Group plant in Wackersdorf is home to cockpit production and parts supply for overseas plants. With the opening of a new battery testing centre and commissioning of the first phase in autumn 2024, the location also makes a significant contribution to electromobility. An entirely new area of expertise is the door and flap centre for Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe BMW Group core staff at the Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations in eastern Bavaria consists of around 9,250 employees, including about 350 apprentices."}

The new BMW iX3 demonstrates the BMW Group's take on implementing a holistic approach to product sustainability across the entire life cycle. During product development, extensive measures were implemented throughout the supply chain, production and use phases, explicitly focused on conserving resources and reducing the model’s environmental footprint. As such, the Neue Klasse marks an important milestone toward achieving the company's 2030 and 2050 CO₂e targets. CO₂e benefits achievable after only one year of use The extensive decarbonization measures in the supply chain results in an early break-even point: when charged with electricity from the European energy mix, the CO₂e footprint of the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive is lower than that of a comparable model with a combustion engine after about 21,500 kilometers (WLTP combined). When charged exclusively with electricity from renewable sources, the BMW iX3 50 xDrive beats the comparable ICE model after only 17,500 kilometers (WLTP combined), allowing customers to potentially achieve CO₂e benefits in as little as one year. Decarbonization in the supply chain The key levers to reduce CO₂e emissions in the supply chain are the use of secondary materials and renewable energy, alongside product and process innovations. This combination of measures has led to a decrease of CO₂e emissions in the supply chain of 35% during product development.The Gen6 battery cells of the BMW iX3 high-voltage storage system are made of 50% secondary cobalt, lithium, and nickel materials. In addition, renewable energies are harnessed in the anode and cathode materials and cell production. This is how CO₂e emissions per watt hour were reduced by 42% compared to the Gen5 cell of the previous model.\n\nThe BMW Group is increasingly focused on the use of innovative and secondary materials in other components as well. For instance, 30% of the secondary raw material used for the engine compartment cover and the storage compartment under the front hatch is recycled maritime plastic. This post-consumer material consists of old fishing nets and ropes, preventing these materials from potentially being dumped in the ocean.Secondary aluminum accounts for 80% of the wheel carriers and swivel bearings as well as 70% of the cast aluminum wheels. ‘Design for Circularity’: consistent implementation in the Neue Klasse The BMW Group applied the ‘Design for Circularity’ approach consistently in developing the BMW iX3. The approach builds on the concepts of secondary first (the prioritized use of secondary materials), strategic material selection and disassembly optimization. As a result, secondary materials account for one third of all material used in the new BMW iX3 50 xDrive.One example of implementing these three concepts is the Econeer seat cover, available in the interior trim Essential, whose fabric, adhesive and fleece are all made from PET. This mono-material choice increases recyclability. Moreover, the textile yarn used consists entirely of recycled PET as well.Other components whose development followed the ‘Design for Circularity’ approach include the center console, instrument panel and interior floor trim. Significantly improved efficiency in the use phase BMW EfficientDynamics involves consistently identifying and harnessing efficiency potential in all vehicle subsystems. Applying this approach, the energy consumption of the new BMW iX3 is 20% lower than in the predecessor model (WLTP combined).This significant improvement is primarily based on optimized aerodynamic properties, reduced rolling resistance and on-board power consumption as well as the drive’s unparalleled combination of efficiency and dynamics. Sustainability-centric production at BMW Group’s Debrecen plant Designed and built according to the BMW iFactory principles, the new BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary, is fully focused on efficiency, digitalization and sustainability. It is the first BMW Group car factory that is operated and produces vehicles without using fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, under normal operating conditions.The only energy source to power operations at the site is electricity. According to current planning, up to 25% of the plant's annual electricity needs can be covered by the photovoltaic system located on the premises. The remaining electricity is obtained from other renewable energy sources. Surplus solar energy is stored in a heat storage unit and used to heat the paint shop ovens as needed.Only 0.1 tons of CO₂e are emitted in the production of a BMW iX3 car, about two third below production at other BMW Group plants. The BMW Group’s sustainability targets The BMW Group's commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and to achieving Net Zero by 2050 or earlier is an integral part of the comprehensive 360° sustainability approach incorporated in the corporate strategy. The company is pursuing ambitious, scientifically derived CO₂e targets for the coming years. For instance, the BMW Group intends to reduce its CO₂e emissions by at least 40 million tons in 2030 (baseline: 2019). Publicly accessible, TÜV-verified Product Carbon Footprint For years, the BMW Group has released its vehicle footprint, which includes a greenhouse gas report for its vehicles verified by Germany’s TÜV Technical Inspection Association. The report for the new BMW iX3 50 xDRIVE can be downloaded here and is also available in the My BMW app. It offers increased transparency regarding raw materials used and CO₂e emissions over the entire vehicle lifecycle.\n\nAll information regarding the BMW iX3 50 xDrive’s mileage, energy consumption, range, energy content, dimensions, weights, share of secondary raw materials/recycled materials and other technical data and derivations thereof are provisional as of the start of production in November 2025.\n\nAll model variants, equipment levels, technical data, fuel consumption and emission data mentioned correspond to the range offered in the German car market, provided the respective model is available there. Deviations in other markets are possible. Dimensions refer to the base model available in Germany; depending on wheel and tire size as well as optional equipment selected, dimensions may vary depending on the specific configuration.\n\nPower consumption and range data were measured in accordance with the mandatory WLTP procedures and comply with the German Passenger Car Energy Consumption Labelling Ordinance (EnVKV). For more information, see \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe economic success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. Sustainability is a key element of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy and covers all products from the supply chain and production to the end of their useful life."}

Ultimately, a good strategy brought us forward, but we also showed strong pace during the race. The team success with the one-two finish is, of course, fantastic. We’re super happy. I think it’s a relief for everyone on the team. Now we can head into the final two races with momentum and hope to finish the season on a high note.\"\n\nNeil Verhagen (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"My first IMSA win feels fantastic. We had great momentum with Paul Miller Racing, starting with the win for our sister car at Watkins Glen and my pole position in Canada, even though we couldn’t make it to the podium there. To finally achieve it now is incredible. I can’t thank everyone at Paul Miller Racing and BMW M Motorsport enough for their support. We had a very strong package here and executed it perfectly. Hopefully, we can carry this momentum into the remaining races.\"\n\nMadison Snow (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"Finally, we have our first win of the season. It’s such a relief. This was a great race for us. I’ve been part of this fantastic team for so long. Seeing how it has grown and now standing here celebrating this GTD PRO victory is big.\""}

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has taken a significant step forward in the battle for the title in the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC). At the third of four rounds in the season, the prestigious Suzuka 8 Hours (JPN), Markus Reiterberger (GER), Steven Odendaal (RSA), and Michael van der Mark (NED) finished fifth aboard the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. As a result, the BMW factory team not only climbed to second place in the championship standings, but now heads into the season finale in September at Le Castellet (FRA) just one point behind leaders YART. Also turning in a strong performance was the AutoRace Ube Racing Team from Japan: Naomichi Uramoto (JPN), Loris Baz (FRA), and Davey Todd (GBR) claimed sixth place on the #76 bike. And just like last year, BMW teams secured a one-two finish in the Superstock class: Team Étoile took the win ahead of the TONE Team 4413 EVA 02 BMW.\n\nAlready during Friday’s qualifying, the speed of the BMW M 1000 RR was evident, with Uramoto setting a new lap record of 2:04.796 minutes. In the decisive Top 10 Trial on Saturday, he and his teammates secured third place on the grid for the AutoRace Ube Racing Team. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team also qualified strongly and started the race from fifth place.\n\nIn the turmoil of the start, bike #37 initially dropped a few positions, but Reiterberger, Odendaal, and van der Mark worked their way back up. By the third hour, van der Mark – who posted several of the race’s fastest laps – had moved into third. However, a rare technical defect occurred; the right footpeg came loose, causing the Dutchman to crash as he approached the pits for repairs. Although the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team quickly returned the bike to the track after repairs, they found themselves down in 21st place. From there, the factory trio launched a remarkable comeback, ultimately finishing fifth in the race and second in the championship standings.\n\nUramoto, Baz, and Todd, on the #76 bike, were also consistently battling in the top ranks throughout the race. In the end, the AutoRace Ube Racing Team earned a strong sixth-place finish. The ERC Endurance #6 squad, with riders Kenny Foray (FRA), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), and David Checa (ESP), finished in 11th.\n\nIn the Superstock class, the BMW M 1000 RR was, once again, unbeatable. Team Étoile, with the #25 bike, claimed victory in the category. In the championship standings – the FIM World Cup – they are now tied on points with the leaders, holding second place. The one-two finish was completed by the TONE Team 4413 EVA 02 BMW in second place on the Superstock podium. In total, no fewer than eight BMW teams competed at Suzuka.\n\nThe all-important season finale, the 24-hour classic Bol d’Or, takes place from 18th to 21st September at Le Castellet.\n\nReactions after the Suzuka 8 Hours:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This race week began with devastating news, and our thoughts are with Sylvain Guintoli and his family. We really wanted to get on the podium for his son Luca. That was our big goal – to represent the family here and honour Luca. Even though we didn’t quite make it, we kept the championship wide open and are now heading to the Bol d’Or in a great position. At Sylvain’s home finale, we have a very strong chance to fight for the title. We did a great job this week, and were only unlucky in the race due to a technical defect, which was no one’s fault. Without that, we would certainly have made it to the podium. But overall, the team delivered a fantastic performance. All three riders proved their abilities. We’re especially pleased that Mickey, a four-time Suzuka winner, did an outstanding job and showcased his full talent. Also, the AutoRace Ube Racing Team – a Japanese outfit making their debut with BMW here – did an incredible job. Local hero Naomichi Uramoto almost took pole position. We’re very proud to have them on board and will continue to work closely together in the future. I believe this is the beginning of a very strong partnership. ERC Endurance also did an outstanding job, completing their third race in a row without mistakes. On the Superstock side, it was fantastic to achieve another one-two result with Team Étoile and TONE. Huge congratulations to them! We represented BMW in the best possible way here at Suzuka, and now we can’t wait for the Bol d’Or and the chance to fight for the title. But first, we all need to let this week sink. Suzuka is rightly one of the most historic events with an incredible fan base. What we experienced here is truly unique, and we’ll continue to support it strongly in the future.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “First and foremost, our heartfelt condolences go to Sylvain and his family. Little Luca was with us on the bike throughout the race, and I believe he watched from above as the whole team gave their all. This race week was a challenge. The conditions were very tough, with asphalt temperatures reaching up to 69 degrees Celsius. We steadily improved over the days, step by step, and had real top-three pace during the race. Unfortunately, a technical issue caused a very unlucky crash. Mickey was slightly hurt but pushed through, being a true fighter and leader, and showed very strong pace. All three riders had the pace for a podium finish – it was a superb team effort. We wanted to be the first European manufacturer to reach the Suzuka podium. That didn’t quite happen, but going into the season finale just one point behind is the best possible setup for a thrilling title fight. And our goal remains the same: we want to win the title. Our privateer teams capped off a very successful weekend for the BMW M 1000 RR. The AutoRace Ube team showed incredible pace and an outstanding qualifying. Add to that the dominance in the Superstock class – another one-two win from our BMW teams.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I'm very happy because the goal was to get closer to YART. I think the podium would have also been possible here because our riders did incredible lap times but our main focus is on the championship and we are only one point behind now. The goal for Le Castellet is clear: it doesn’t matter in which place we finish the race, but the championship is the most important thing.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I had a very good race week here with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. We were doing this race for Sylvain, Luca and the family. It was special. We tried as much as we could and I think especially at the beginning of the race we had a podium pace. We were in P3 but a bit unlucky with a technical failure and then a crash where we lost a lot of time. But the team showed proper endurance spirit, they repaired the bike, Steven and Markus were fast, the whole team did fantastic pit stops. And then I just did my thing. It was painful, it was tough, but I think we should be happy with P5 here at Suzuka after the crash and after we lost a lot of time.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “To finish fifth at Suzuka again is, on one hand, disappointing because we had a real chance at the podium. We were already running in third, but then had a technical issue we’ve never encountered before. Still, we fought back incredibly well. The team reacted brilliantly and got the bike repaired super quickly. With fifth place, we gained a lot of points on YART, the championship leader. We’re now just one point behind – I don’t think we’ve ever been this close. Now we want to bring it home at Le Castellet. That’s a track we really like. So we’re satisfied with Suzuka. We worked well with the new tyre supplier, the whole team is pulling together, and everything just fits from A to Z.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It’s always special to come here to Suzuka. It was my second time and I am really happy to be here with the team. We did a fantastic job and closed the gap to the number one in the championship. It's a nice shootout for the last race, only one point between us. Let's focus all our efforts now to bring us this championship home.”\n\nQualifying (combined).\n\nAutoRace Ube Racing Team\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nSANMEI Team TARO PLUSONE with SDG\n\nSHINSYUREN with TOTEC\n\nTONE Team 4413 EVA 02 BMW\n\nAutoRace Ube Racing Team\n\nSDG Team HARC–PRO Honda\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nSDG Team HARC-PRO Honda\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nAutoRace Ube Racing Team\n\nSANMEI Team TARO PLUSONE with SDG\n\nTONE Team 4413 EVA 02 BMW\n\nSHINSYUREN with TOTEC\n\nCurrent World Championship standings (R03/04).\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team"}

The BMW Group Plant Steyr today began series production of the e-engine for the Neue Klasse. “Today, we are laying the foundations for the future of the BMW Group,” explained Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production. “As the first production site for the Gen6 electric engine, Plant Steyr is central to the Neue Klasse and the continued development of our global production network.” The electric engine for the sixth generation of BMW eDrive (Gen6) is the first fully-electric drive train to be produced at the Steyr location in Austria. From there, it will be shipped throughout the production network, providing the drive train for the Neue Klasse. “Three years ago, we announced that we would build this electric engine in Steyr. Today, we are proud to deliver it,” said Klaus von Moltke, SVP of Engine Production for BMW AG and plant director of the Steyr facility. “What we are launching here today is more than just a production ramp-up. It is a firm commitment to Europe, to technology and to the future.”\n\nTechnology openness: Plant Steyr as centre of drive train expertise\n\nBetween the project launch in 2022 and 2030, the BMW Group is investing over one billion euros in expanding development and production expertise for e-drives at the Steyr location. This capacity expansion will ensure the plant remains the BMW Group's leading location for drive trains. For over 40 years, the plant has developed and manufactured internal combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands. This extensive experience and wealth of expertise in drive trains make the engine plant the ideal facility to produce the Gen6 electric engines. The site will continue to manufacture diesel and petrol engines in parallel. “Technology openness is our strength – it gives us the necessary flexibility to secure long-term jobs,” said von Moltke. Around 1,000 employees will work in the new electric engine assembly. Depending on global demand, half of the Steyr location’s total workforce could be employed in e-mobility by 2030. von Moltke: “Steyr will remain the heart of our drive train expertise – both for combustion engines and electromobility.”\n\nPowertrain components produced in Steyr, aluminium housings from Landshut\n\nRotor, stator, transmission and inverter – all core components of the innovative, highly integrated e-drive – will be manufactured at Plant Steyr. The housing for the electric engine will be cast at Plant Landshut's aluminium foundry and further processed in Steyr. The inverter will be produced in a new in-house clean-room environment, marking the Austrian engine manufacturer’s entry into the field of electrical engineering. E-drive components from Steyr will be assembled on two new lines. The overall production concept for the Gen6 e-drive follows the principle of a modular system, making it possible to produce different highly flexible electric drive train derivatives for the entire range of Neue Klasse models. The modular concept generates positive economies of scale and cost savings in both development and production. It also improves the scalability of production volumes and keeps production, supply networks and procurement highly flexible.\n\nComprehensive improvements to electric engine\n\nThe electric engine has undergone significant further development for Gen6: The rotor, stator and inverter have all been holistically designed for the Gen6 technology’s new 800-volt architecture, maximising performance capabilities and the efficiency of the drive system. In the inverter, 800-volt technology and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor technology are now being used to boost efficiency. Fully integrated into the electric engine housing, the inverter converts direct current from the high-voltage battery into alternating current for the electric engine.\n\nLower weight, costs and energy loss lead to greater vehicle efficiency\n\nOverall, the intelligent use of new technologies in the e-drive and systematic further development of existing systems produce remarkable results. Comparing the future BMW iX3 50 xDrive with a Gen5 xDrive model shows the following improvements in the electric engine: “Energy loss is reduced by 40 percent, costs by 20 percent and weight by 10 percent. All this makes a significant contribution to the approximately 20-percent increase in overall vehicle efficiency”, explains Martin Kaufmann, SVP of global Powertrain Development at BMW AG. The efficient design of the powertrain together with the high energy content of the high-voltage battery, enable a range of up to 800 km (WLTP) in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive, the first model of the Neue Klasse."}

The partnership between BMW M and the Nürburgring, which has thrived for over 25 years, is a great success and is visible from afar through landmarks such as the BMW M Power Grandstand and the BMW M Bridge. Through the offerings of the local BMW M Driving Experience, enthusiasts can drive BMW M vehicles themselves under professional guidance through the \"Green Hell.\" The redesigned BMW M Power Showroom in 2021 emphasizes the significance of the Nürburgring as the home of BMW M. The Nürburgring Nordschleife, known worldwide as one of the most challenging racetracks, serves as a proving ground for drivers and vehicles. Spanning 20.832 kilometres and featuring over 70 corners, it demands the highest performance and driving dynamics. Lap times are a benchmark for a vehicle's sporting capabilities, with record runs monitored by a neutral testing organization to ensure compliance with production standards. The Nürburgring plays a crucial role for BMW M not only in development and testing but also in motorsport. BMW M vehicles have achieved numerous successes, including 21 overall victories at the 24-hour race. This year, ROWE Racing secured the latest victory. After a challenging start to the weekend, the team raced from 17th position. Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) delivered an outstanding comeback to clinch victory for BMW M Motorsport.\n\nThe first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring: Maximum performance, typical M feeling, and absolute everyday usability.

And it underscores that there is not ONE automotive industry – major players are currently performing quite differently.\n\nThrough the first half-year, our sales performance demonstrates the appeal of our global brands and the ongoing success of our broad technological approach.\n\nAfter confirming our original guidance from our Annual Conference after the first quarter results, we remain on track with our financial targets for the year – despite ongoing tariff uncertainty and fluctuations in the Chinese market.\n\nUnpredictability is a longstanding feature of the auto industry and is the norm in today’s business environment. What is decisive is how you deal with it. Because global success is rather predicated on your ability to anticipate developments and to respond rationally and efficiently.\n\nThat is fundamental to the BMW Group. And we are building upon our leading position in the industry.\n\nThe overall global automotive market is growing. We are always ready to profitably gain market share wherever individual market conditions allow. As dynamics in the industry shift, we know exactly where we are placed with our premium brands and where we can pursue opportunities – maintaining a healthy balance of value and volume.\n\nOver many decades, we have built up a comprehensive and balanced network of sales, production and supply chain operations spanning the major regions. This makes us one of the few truly global players in the industry and our deep roots in global markets offer us many advantages.\n\nFirst, they allow us to tap into leading-edge developments in the individual markets and understand specific customer needs. Our ties to research universities, our R&D network and IT hubs and our network of local tech partners enable us to leverage key competencies from individual markets for our global products and strategy.\n\nSecond, through our extensive footprint in key markets, we remain resilient in the face of geopolitical instability and ever-increasing regulation.\n\nFinally, our strong ties also allow us to engage in direct discussions with key political decision-makers, who value our perspective. Here, it is not just about our individual interests, but rather finding solutions for customers worldwide and driving shared economic prosperity.\n\nThe BMW Group welcomes the fundamental agreement between the European Union and the United States to reduce tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic. It’s now important to quickly finalize and implement the agreed measures.\n\nWe will continue to advocate for trade between the EU and the US not be hindered by import tariffs. The currently agreed US tariffs also burden European exports, affecting consumers and globally operating companies. Therefore, we urge both sides to continue working towards market openness and the convergence of technical regulations.\n\nThrough our global production network and supply chains, we maintain high flexibility to respond to fluctuations. Our production plants are attuned to market demand, allowing us to achieve capacity utilization above the industry standards.\n\nAt our largest single plant in Spartanburg in the United States, for example, we produce over 400,000 vehicles annually. Over half of which serve the local market and half of which we export. Across the United States we have created extensive value chains as well as a competency hub for our global X Family of vehicles in Spartanburg, which remain in high demand across the entire globe.\n\nBMW made in America and sold to the world.\n\nThis combination of leveraging the competitive advantage of the US market in SUVs with BMW’s brand strength allows us to develop products which speak to customers’ needs in markets worldwide.\n\nFor the current financial year, our sales results continued into Q2 in line with our expectations, as conditions continue to vary from market to market. In Q2, we saw a sequential improvement from Q1.\n\nOutside of China, all three of our major sales regions posted growth.\n\nGroup sales in these markets combined to grow by 6.3% through the first six months of the year.\n\nGroup sales in Europe grew overall by 10.2% in the second quarter and in Germany alone by over 10%, with growth in most markets outpacing the passenger vehicle market. Overall, the BMW brand increased its market share in Europe.\n\nAmong the most successful BMW models were those in the business class segment. In the first half of the year, the BMW 5 Series saw growth of more than 40% worldwide compared to 2024.\n\nOther notable models that saw success included the BMW X2 models, which more than doubled sales through June.\n\nWith the full availability of the new MINI family, the brand grew in all regions worldwide, including in China. In the first half of the year, more than one in three MINIs sold was a BEV.\n\nRolls-Royce increased deliveries by nearly 10% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales from the Cullinan Series II*.\n\nDrivetrains and model variants across the portfolio continued to see success in Q2. BMW M sold nearly 106,000 vehicles through June, the best-ever first half-year for the brand.\n\nSales of plug-in hybrid models from the BMW brand grew by almost 30% in the first six months. Our BEV models continue to be a fundamental pillar of our strategy. In the second quarter, we achieved an important milestone, with the delivery of our 1.5-millionth all-electric vehicle. Across the portfolio, we now offer more than 15 all-electric models.\n\nIn Europe, the Group’s BEV share reached 25%. With PHEVs included, the electrified share reached nearly 40%. Across all brands, BMW is the third best-selling BEV brand in Europe.\n\nWhile we are proud of our position as a leading BEV player, we know that the world is multi-dimensional.\n\nTo meet consumer needs, especially in a product as complex and personal as a car, there is no single answer. Our Q2 results show that we can serve multiple preferences simultaneously: BEVs, PHEVs and our M models all achieved growth.\n\nTo achieve these goals and create effective CO2 regulations, we must take a comprehensive view across the entire value chain. This would consider all emissions across the entire life cycle and not just tailpipe emissions: from the supply chain to the raw materials used in the car, the production process, the vehicle drive, energy used to power the vehicle, and finally to recycling.\n\nA dependency on a single technology can be damaging to an industry. Putting all your eggs in one basket is just poor asset allocation.\n\nHydrogen, for example, offers Europe an opportunity to use our expertise and take the lead on an emerging technology that will contribute to our climate goals. And, unlike BEVs, without the need for large amounts of raw materials or battery technology which are not localizable at large scale in Europe.\n\nBeyond drivetrains, there is great potential with alternative fuels. There are more than 250 million vehicles in the EU, which could now immediately contribute to climate protection. But this requires a clear regulatory pathway and targeted investments in the ramp-up of all renewable fuels.\n\nTake HVO100 as an example. While it is already available in markets across Europe, tax schemes and the CO2 fleet targets need to recognize this renewable fueling option to incentivize customer adoption. This would help in scaling an alternative fuel that has a 90% CO2 saving compared to normal fuels and can already be accessed today. For OEMs and customers, this is also a cost-effective way to reduce emissions in the use phase.\n\nFor Europe to maintain competitiveness and finance its future, we need to invest not only in new technologies, but also leverage our existing technologies, which can meet customer preferences and still contribute to climate targets.\n\nFor the BMW Group, we are now just five weeks away from the next major innovation step, which our entire company has been fully focused on for many years now: the launch of the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nOn September 5th, we will celebrate the world premiere of the all-new BMW iX3* at the IAA Mobility here in Munich.\n\nIn June we hosted media representatives at the pre-drive event in Miramas in southern France. The initial feedback has been tremendous.\n\nWe remain right on time with the launch, including at our new Plant in Debrecen. Construction also continues at our battery assembly facility in Irlbach-Straßkirchen.\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we are making great strides in all relevant technology fields – whether in electrification, digital user experience, driving dynamics or sustainability.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 will be benchmark in the industry.\n\nThe all-electric 6th generation powertrain will set standards in performance and efficiency:\n\nIn addition, our revolutionary new iDrive will change the way the driver interacts with the car. With the BMW iDrive, we set an industry standard more than twenty years ago. After the reveal of the all-new Panoramic iDrive at CES in January, we are already seeing the industry follow our lead.\n\nWith the technology clusters we have developed for the NEUE KLASSE, we will scale our advanced technologies across the portfolio. We will start in the core segment to build momentum quickly. This is simply smart economics.\n\nBy 2027, we will bring 40 new models and model updates with NEUE KLASSE technology and design language on the road worldwide.\n\nOur technology cluster approach also allows us to integrate market-specific features and content. In our major sales regions, we have a variety of local solutions with leading partners. This allows us, for example, to further enhance the digital user experience as well as automated driving functions in our upcoming NEUE KLASSE models.\n\nIn China, we are collaborating with Alibaba Banma to develop the next level of intuitive and conversational in-car voice interaction. We will also enhance our BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant with functionality from DeepSeek in our vehicles in China.\n\nIn most other countries, the next-gen BMW intelligent personal assistant will be powered by large language model technology from Amazon Alexa.\n\nFor driving assistance systems that meet local needs and regulations, we have also sought out partners in different geographies. Always following our philosophy in this area: smart, symbiotic and safe.\n\nJust two weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Momenta, a leading Chinese ADAS technology provider. The partnership will focus on software development and integration for Chinese road-networks, traffic-conditions and user expectations, utilizing advanced AI algorithms and data driven development methods. We will launch the systems in China starting with our NEUE KLASSE.\n\nIn other markets, we continue to build on our already very successful partnership with Qualcomm.\n\nThese examples show how adaptive the NEUE KLASSE architecture is.\n\nWith a software-defined vehicle, we maintain competency over all systems of the car and can roll them out to markets at the same time across the world. But we also are able to quickly integrate local tech stacks into our own ecosystem to give consumers access to innovations and features they are used to.\n\nAnd through backward integration of software solutions available for all aspects of the vehicle over the air, we will continuously enhance the customer experience.\n\nThis is a huge advantage for us.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nOur consistent strategic approach and continued success is not a coincidence but the result of resolute, long-term planning and orientation. It is a multi-year process in every area of the company.\n\nThis is what our stakeholders expect from us.\n\nThe BMW brand is a promise. And we deliver on our promises.\n\nWe continue to build upon the strong position we are in today.\n\nWith the rollout of NEUE KLASSE technologies and products over the next two years, we will bring the company to a whole new level.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: Rolls-Royce Cullinan Series II: energy consumption combined: 162,0 l/100km; CO₂ emissions combined: 365 g/km; CO₂ class: G BMW iX3: energy consumption: 18,0 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: A"}

Here, price levels of the second half of 2024 continued into the first half-year of 2025, as expected.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by about 200 million euros compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nGroup R&D expenditure as of June totaled 4 billion euros, slightly below previous year.\n\nThe R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code came in at 6 percent after six months.\n\nFor the full year, R&D expenditure will be below last year’s level, and it will steadily decrease over the next years.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses also decreased by around 100 million euros compared to the previous year.\n\nThe year-on-year headwind of 1.1 billion euros from Other Cost Changes can mainly be attributed to two factors:\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q2\n\nFree cash flow in the Automotive Segment totaled about 1.9 billion euros in the second quarter.\n\nSegment EBT amounted to 1.6 billion euros, which is 1 billion euros lower than in the previous year’s quarter.\n\nThe net change in working capital reduced free cashflow by around 300 million euros.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation had an impact of 200 million euros in the second quarter.\n\nCapital expenditure for the first half-year amounted to around 2.7 billion euros, a significant year-on-year reduction of around 700 million euros.\n\nThe capex ratio was 4.5 percent for the second quarter and 4 percent for the first six months.\n\nAfter the peak in 2024, capex will decrease for the full year 2025.\n\nWe expect a capex ratio below 6 percent for 2025.\n\nChanges to provisions negatively impacted free cash flow in the second quarter by around 200 million euros. This was mainly due to the consumption of warranty provisions.\n\nThe change in the position Other of around 1 billion euros reflects the development of a set of various topics, including accrued expenses, interest and advance payments received, income taxes and liabilities for tariff expenses not yet paid out.\n\nAfter the first six months, Automotive Segment free cash flow is on previous year’s level with just over 2.3 billion euros.\n\nFor the full year, we are targeting a free cash flow of over 5 billion euros.\n\nOur strong free cash flow generation enables us to further execute our consistent shareholder return strategy.\n\nIn May of this year, the Annual General Meeting authorized the Board of Management to buy back up to 10 percent of BMW AG's share capital over the next five years.\n\nBased on this authorization, a third share repurchase program with a volume of up to 2 billion euros was approved.\n\nIt should be completed by April 30, 2027, at the latest.\n\nThe first tranche of 750 million euros began in May and will be completed no later than December 8th of this year.\n\nSLIDE 7: Financial Services Segment in H1\n\nLet’s move on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nThe number of new contracts, concluded with retail customers in the first half year, reached almost 825,000 contracts, a slight decrease of 3 percent year-on-year.\n\nThis is due to the challenging situation on the Chinese market, which led to a moderate decrease in new credit financing business.\n\nThe new leasing business continued its dynamic growth in the first six months of the year.\n\nThe penetration rate for lease and loan offerings increased by 2.5 percentage points to 43.7 percent.\n\nDriven by a higher average financing amount per contract, new business volume was on previous year’s level despite the slight decrease in new contracts.\n\nSegment earnings amounted to just under 1.2 billion euros, a year-on-year decrease of 19.5 percent.\n\nThis results mainly from two topics:\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained at a low rate of 0.27 percent.\n\nSLIDE 8: Motorcycles Segment in Q2\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, deliveries decreased moderately by 8 percent year-on-year.\n\nSegment revenues decreased by 2.8 percent.\n\nAdjusted for currency translation effects, they were on par with the second quarter of 2024.\n\nSegment EBIT in the second quarter totaled 136 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 14.2 percent.\n\nSLIDE 9: Outlook 2025\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nOur outlook for the full year is based on assumptions, which are described in detail in our half-year report.\n\nLet me briefly mention some key factors for our business development in 2025.\n\nIn China, we have been observing increased monitoring of the automotive market by local regulatory authorities since the last two weeks of June.\n\nThis also affects commission payments from local banks to dealerships in connection with brokering retail financial and insurance products, payment terms to the supplier base as well as increased scrutiny of price competition.\n\nDealer commissions were significantly reduced by local banks in June.\n\nWe are closely following these developments and their potential impact on the Chinese automotive market.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs you recall, our guidance given in March included all tariffs in force as of March 12th.\n\nIn our quarterly statement for Q1, we had assessed and included all tariff increases announced as of May 7th and confirmed our original guidance based on certain assumptions.\n\nAnd in today’s half-year report, we maintain our consistent approach and have also incorporated the effects of all latest announcements.\n\nAccording to the announcements on July 27th, an agreement between the US and the EU regarding the tariff situation is emerging.\n\nBased on published information by the respective authorities, we expect partial reductions of the currently applicable tariffs between the US and the EU from August 1st.\n\nAdditionally, tariff negotiations across the globe are ongoing and may result in further changes.\n\nTherefore, the expected impact from tariffs on our full-year results can still only be estimated based on certain assumptions.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we currently expect a burden from tariffs of around 1.25 percentage points on the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment, including mitigations.\n\nBased on our assumptions, the full-year outlook remains unchanged.\n\nOn a Group level, we are targeting earnings before tax at previous year’s level.\n\nIn the Automotive segment, we expect a slight increase in deliveries and an EBIT margin in a corridor between 5 and 7 percent.\n\nThe EBIT margin in the Motorcycles Segment should come in at between 5.5 and 7.5 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, we expect a Return on Equity in the range of 13 to 16 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Q2 and H2 Profitability within Full-Year Target Corridor\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group is a truly differentiated global player.\n\nWe set ourselves apart in the automotive industry with our global footprint and our highly flexible operations.\n\nThis strong strategic positioning enables us to mitigate the impact of tariffs and allows us to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions.\n\nThe BMW Group has a focused strategy and a clear plan how to effectively navigate our operating business.\n\nAs a result, we were able to provide a comprehensive guidance for the year 2025 in March, including the impact of tariffs.\n\nAnd we delivered an EBIT margin within the full year target corridor of 5 to 7 percent both in the second quarter and for half-year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, we are steering our business carefully and in a consistent manner.\n\nDuring the last years, we significantly invested in the future of our company, in line with our long-term planning.\n\nIn 2024, both capex and R&D reached peak levels.\n\nStarting in 2025, we are reducing R&D and capex spending, as planned.\n\nOur operating costs are also decreasing compared to prior year. Just as in Q1, this is again evident in our Q2 figures.\n\nBased on the results of the first six months, we once again confirm our full-year targets for 2025.\n\nAnd we remain committed to our long-term goals\n\nof premium profitability and capital return to create value\n\nfor all our stakeholders."}

The BMW Group showed strong resilience in the first half of the year – building on a solid foundation of consistent strategy, robust customer demand, sustained cost discipline and high flexibility. With sales volumes stable at over 1.2 million premium vehicles, and with potential for further growth, the company reported Group earnings before tax of more than € 5.7 billion and an EBT margin of 8.5% in the first six months of 2025.\n\nThe Automotive Segment EBIT margin came in at 6.2%, placing it in the upper half of the 5.0-7.0% annual target range, published in March. The segment's free cash flow for the first half-year was € 2.345 billion. At the six-month mark, the BMW Group is therefore on track to meet its targets for the year.\n\n\"Our performance in the first half of 2025 once again underscores the robustness of our business model. Our success today, as well as in the future, is based on three strong pillars: our global footprint, our strength in innovation, and our technology-neutral approach with highly attractive products,\" said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of BMW AG. \"In September, we will begin a new era for BMW when the first vehicle of the NEUE KLASSE makes its debut at the IAA Mobility. With the BMW iX3*, we are kicking off an unprecedented product ramp-up: by 2027, we will launch more than 40 new and revised models across all segments and drive types. Each vehicle will embody the innovative technology clusters and the new design language. This way, we connect technological advancement and exciting products with strategic foresight and economic efficiency.\"\n\nBy offering different drive technologies and a comprehensive range of models, the premium manufacturer from Munich is able to meet diverse customer preferences, reporting growth across numerous markets: Outside of China, BMW deliveries rose across all sales regions, with the brand recording slight growth of +4.7%.\n\nBenefiting from full availability of the New MINI Family, the British cult brand reported significant growth of 17.4% in the first half of the year, with a total of 133,838 vehicles sold. MINI deliveries increased in all regions of the world.\n\nIn Europe, the BMW Group posted solid sales growth of +8.2%, with 498,670 units sold (Q2 deliveries: 256,487 units; +10.2%).In the Americas region, deliveries increased by +3.4% to 237,972 vehicles (Q2: 123,254 units; +1.7%).\n\nDeliveries in the US market rose by +2.7% year-on-year, with a total of 193,826 vehicles delivered to customers (Q2: 98,856 units; +1.4%).\n\nElectrified models and BMW M vehicles with increased sales volumes\n\nWith a 26.4% share (Q2: 26.0%) of total sales in the first six months, more than one in four BMW Group vehicles delivered – precisely 319,031 units – was electrified. Europe recorded the highest growth rates for BEVs and PHEVs, at 34,8%.\n\nAlongside electrified vehicles (+6.5%), the high-performance models of the BMW M brand were the main growth drivers for the BMW brand: With nearly 106,000 vehicles sold (+6.5% compared to HY1 2024), BMW M GmbH reported the highest first-half-year sales in its history. The BMW M3* and BMW M3 Touring*, together with the BMW M5* and BMW M5 Touring* introduced at the start of the year, made a significant contribution to this result.\n\nMINI grows with BEV models\n\nMINI’s sales growth also stemmed mainly from MINI BEVs: the MINI Cooper Electric*, the MINI Aceman Electric* and the MINI Countryman Electric*. With a 34.3% share in the first half-year, more than one in three MINIs delivered to customers worldwide was battery-electric.\n\nIn the first half of 2025, the Rolls-Royce brand built on the previous year’s strong sales performance, delivering 2,796 handcrafted luxury motor cars to customers (-0.8%). In the second quarter, it increased its sales by +9.4% year-on-year to 1,415 units.\n\nThe growing percentage of electrified vehicles confirms the BMW Group's successful approach of offering its customers a broad range of models, all available with different drive technologies. More than 15 fully-electric vehicles and 12 PHEVs are currently available. In the second quarter of 2025, the BMW Group reached a major milestone in its drive train strategy, with the delivery of its 1.5-millionth BEV since the launch of the first BMW i3 in 2013.\n\nGroup EBT margin of 8.5% in first half-year\n\nGroup revenues for the first half-year totalled € 67,685 million(2024: € 73,558 million/-8.0%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -7.1%; Q2: € 33,927 million; Q2 2024: € 36,944 million; -8.2%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.5%).\n\nCompared with the previous year, revenues were pressured by currency translation headwinds and the expected subdued demand in China. The positive impact of strong growth in new leasing business at BMW Group Financial Services resulted in higher revenue eliminations between segments, which dampened Group revenues.\n\nFollowing a peak in R&D spending and capital expenditure in 2024, this trend was reversed, as expected, in the first half of the year – without compromising the premium manufacturer's commitment to innovation leadership.\n\nDriven by a strong operating performance, the BMW Group’s expenditure for research and development totalled € 4,020 million in the first six months of the year (2024: € 4,169 million/-3.6%). This figure was down slightly on the previous year, despite intensive preparations for the upcoming models of the NEUE KLASSE, including the BMW iX3 and other successor models. R&D spending focused on digitalisation of the vehicle fleet and electrification across all model series. As planned, administrative and sales expenses were reduced, and capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment also declined.\n\nBetween January and June, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 5,727 million (2024: € 8,023 million/-28.6%; Q2: € 2,614 million; Q2 2024: € 3,861 million; -32.3%).\n\nThe EBT margin for the first half year was 8.5% (2024: 10.9%; in Q2: 7.7%; Q2 2024: 10.5%). Group net profit for the first half of the year totalled € 4,015 million (2024: € 5,656 million/-29.0%; Q2: € 1,842 million/-31.9%).\n\nAutomotive Segment EBIT margin within annual target range\n\nIn the first half of the year, the Automotive Segment generated revenues of € 58,654 million (2024: € 63,009 million/-6.9%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.9%; Q2: € 29,443 million; -8.2%; adjusted for currency translation effects: -5.3%). This year-on-year decrease was mainly due to currency translation headwinds and due to the expected decline in sales revenues in China.\n\nSegment earnings before financial result (EBIT) for the first half-year amounted to € 3,626 million (2024: € 5,394 million/-32.8%; Q2: € 1,602 million; -40.3%). The EBIT margin came in at 6.2% (2024: 8.6%; Q2: 5.4%). Excluding depreciation and amortisation from the BBA purchase price allocation, the EBIT margin for the first half-year was 7.3%. The impact of tariff increases – particularly the European Commission’s anti-subsidy measures on Chinese BEVs and the sharp rise in US tariff duties – created headwinds in the automotive segment corresponding to the amount of around 1.5%-points of its EBIT margin in the first half-year.\n\n“Even despite higher tariffs, the BMW Group’s business model remains intact – our popular premium vehicles, global competitive strength and high level of resilience provide us with a strong and sustainable foundation. Our footprint in the US is helping us limit the impact of tariffs,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance, during the quarterly conference call in Munich. “Thanks to precise financial control, based on calculated forecasts, we are firmly on track to achieve our targets for the year at the six-month mark. Higher efficiency and optimised cost structures also contribute to achieving our financial goals.”\n\nFree cash flow of € 2,345 million in Automotive Segment in YTD June\n\nAfter six months, free cash flow in the Automotive Segment totalled € 2,345 million (2024: € 2,289 million) and was thus on track for the annual guidance.\n\nThe BMW Group is still targeting a free cash flow of > € 5 billion in the Automotive Segment for the full year.\n\nFrom January to June, capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to € 2,736 million (2024: € 3,456 million/-20,8%). The capex ratio came in at 4.0% (Q2: 4.5%; HY1 2024: 4.7%; Q2 2024: 5.8%).\n\nDynamic performance continues in Financial Services Segment\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, dynamic growth in new leasing business continued in the first six months of the year: The volume of new leasing business rose significantly (+9.5%), with the leasing share of total new business increasing to 40.0% (2024: 35.5%/+4.5% percentage points). The segment concluded a total of 824,672 new financing and leasing contracts worldwide in the first half of the year (2024: 849,908 contracts/-3.0%). This represents a slight year-on-year decrease, owing to the lower number of new contracts concluded in China.\n\nThe percentage of new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 43.7% by the end of the reporting period (2024: 41.2%/+2.5 percentage points). Thanks to a higher financed amount per vehicle, the volume of new business remained stable at € 31,893 million in the first half of 2025 (2024: € 31,677 million/+0.7%).\n\nIn the six-month period, the Financial Services Segment achieved earnings before tax of € 1,192 million (2024: € 1,481 million/-19.5%). In addition to allocations to provisions, the decline in earnings was primarily driven by lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles in the year-on-year comparison, with the number of such vehicles remaining below the previous year's level.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the credit loss ratio stood at 0.27% across the entire loan portfolio (2024: 0.25%).\n\nBMW Motorrad half-year EBIT margin reported at 12.0%\n\nIn the year to the end of June, BMW Motorrad delivered 105,909 motorcycles and scooters to customers (2024: 113,072 units; -6.3%). The segment EBIT margin came in at 12.0% (2024: 11.6%)\n\nBMW AG continues share repurchase programme\n\nThe Annual General Meeting in May 2025 authorised the Board of Management to buy back up to 10% of BMW AG's share capital over the next five years. Based on this new authorisation, the Board of Management has approved a third share repurchase programme with a volume of up to € 2 billion, to be completed no later than 30 April 2027. Acquisition of the first tranche of € 750 million began in May 2025 and will be completed no later than December 2025. This underlines the consistent execution of the company’s shareholder return strategy.\n\nBMW Group on course to meet guidance\n\nThe latest forecasts of IMF expect a global economic growth of 3.0% this year – eventually impacted by current trade disputes, the potential for higher inflation and ongoing uncertainties among companies and consumers.\n\nThe BMW Group expects increasing demand in many markets in 2025, driven by a stabilizing inflation rate and further moderate interest rate cuts. In China, high competition alongside with significant growth are further forecasted, particularly within the lower price segments.\n\nIn the USA, permanent tariffs could manifest in rising inflation. US trade policy and potential countermeasures from other countries may lead to slower global economic development.\n\nThe forecast published in the BMW Group Report 2024** in March 2025 took into account all tariff increases that had come into effect by March 12, 2025. Following the announcements on July 27, 2025, an agreement between the USA and the EU regarding the customs situation has been reached. Based on this, the BMW Group expects a partial reduction of the currently applicable mutual tariffs for automobiles and production parts from 1 August 2025. Due to the dynamic developments and ongoing negotiations, the expected tariff effects for the current fiscal year can still only be represented through assumptions regarding continuing negotiations. The forecast also includes mitigating measures to dampen the impact of the increased tariffs. In the fiscal year 2025, the BMW Group expects a tariff-related impact of approximately to 1.25 percentage points on the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment.\n\nGiven the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year.\n\nThe company expects slight growth in sales, with the share of fully electric vehicles in deliveries rising slightly.\n\nDue to the factors mentioned above, Group earnings before tax are expected to be on a par with the previous year.***The EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment is forecast to be within the range of 5.0-7.0%. RoCE should be between 9-13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, RoE is projected to be between 13-16%.\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%are forecast, with a RoCE of 13-17%.\n\nThe above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees.\n\nThe BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from the expectations described above – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Earnings risks could arise, among other things, from changes in customs policy, while opportunities lie in a reduction of existing tariffs or their validity period. The company continues to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: IN Q2 2025\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEmployees (as of 31 Dec. 2024)\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1 Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang.\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues\n\n3 Common/preferred shares.

For details, please refer to the glossary in the BMW Group Report 2024.\n\nGLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle.\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nA new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.\n\nProfit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\nProfit/loss as a percentage of revenues.\n\nPlug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.\n\nReturn on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Finance Communications\n\nSebastian Keßler, Communications BMW Group, Strategy\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann, head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nWith its four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services. The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide; the company has a global sales network in more than 140 countries.\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. Sustainability is a key component of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy – from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M3 Competition Limousine mit M xDrive: Energieverbrauch kombiniert: 10,2–10,1 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen kombiniert: 230–228 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klasse(n): G BMW M3 Competition Touring mit M xDrive: Energieverbrauch kombiniert: 10,4 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen kombiniert: 235 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klasse(n): G BMW M5 Limousine: Energieverbrauch gewichtet kombiniert: 26,8 kWh/100 km und 1,9 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen gewichtet kombiniert: 43 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klassen: Bei entladener Batterie G; gewichtet kombiniert B; Kraftstoffverbrauch bei entladener Batterie: 10,7 l/100 km (WLTP) BMW M5 Touring: Energieverbrauch gewichtet kombiniert: 27,6 kWh/100 km und 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen gewichtet kombiniert: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klassen: Bei entladener Batterie G; gewichtet kombiniert B; Kraftstoffverbrauch bei entladener Batterie: 10,9 l/100 km (WLTP) BMW iX3: Energieverbrauch kombiniert: 18,0 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen kombiniert: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klasse(n): A MINI Cooper 3-Türer: MINI Cooper S Pflichtangaben gemäß Pkw-EnVKV nach WLTP: Energieverbrauch kombiniert in l/100km: 6,4; CO2-Emissionen kombiniert in g/km: 144; CO2-Klasse: E MINI Aceman Electric: MINI Aceman SE Pflichtangaben gemäß Pkw-EnVKV nach WLTP : Energieverbrauch kombiniert in kWh/100 km: 14,6; CO2-Emissionen kombiniert in g/km: 0; CO2-Klasse: A MINI Countryman: MINI Countryman C Pflichtangaben gemäß Pkw-EnVKV nach WLTP: Energieverbrauch kombiniert in l/100km: 6,2; CO2-Emissionen kombiniert in g/km: 141; CO2-Klasse: E"}

The BMW Group has brought the Dentsu media agency on board to kickstart its new European media strategy for the BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad brands. From 1 January 2026, Dentsu will also support the BMW Group globally. This means that the expertise of Dentsu – one of the world’s leading marketing and communications agencies – will be used to create a uniform and powerful media presence. As part of the new constellation, media and marketing approaches are being adapted to the requirements of digitalisation and sustainability. The focus here is on artificial intelligence (AI), centralised data management, hybrid teams and integrated platforms (media hubs). The aim is to make campaigns more efficient, more targeted and more responsible.\n\n“I am personally very excited to have Dentsu as our new media agency partner. Together we are entering a new chapter for a communication truly focused on the European customer,” says Uwe Dreher, Vice President Marketing BMW Europe, and adds: “Our goal to act in a highly data-driven and targeted multi-channel and multiple market planning approach elevated via state-of-the-art AI tools to increase efficiency and impact has been reached – the execution will accelerate marketing Return on Investment for our markets even further. BMW Marketing Europe is excited to be launching our Neue Klasse in this new constellation.”\n\nTailor-made communications for the Neue Klasse era.The aim of the call for tenders was to ensure seamless, brand-compliant BMW Group communications across all media channels – at both the national and international level. Awarding the European media business to Dentsu is an important step towards implementing the European media strategy. The consolidation of media activities forms the basis of a standardised solution across all of Europe. The launch of the new agency constellation coincides with the market launch of the Neue Klasse and marks a new era, characterised by highly innovative vehicle technologies on the one hand and a fundamentally new understanding of the brand and communications on the other. The new media approach reflects this transformation.\n\nAI-controlled, with a centralised European media hub.\n\nThe comprehensive use of artificial intelligence will be a key factor. Advanced AI tools will bring even greater precision to media planning. Target groups will be recognised and reached more accurately and decisions made on the basis of concrete data – measurable performance indicators. This will verifiably increase the real-time effectiveness and efficiency of advertising across all customer touchpoints.\n\nAnother key element of the new set-up is the creation of an integrated media hub. Online and offline media will be seamlessly combined on this platform. This enables cross-channel synergies to be recognised and exploited. It helps ensure transparency and makes for efficient planning and implementation. Centralisation enables consolidated control of all activities and channels as well as centralised data analysis. Even so, there will always be room for localisation: national market conditions and cultural specifics – and differentiated responses to them – are additional factors for success.\n\nIntegration of all BMW Group brands.\n\nThe new media strategy follows a multi-brand approach: BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad will be looked at in combination. This creates new opportunities for optimisation across the various media, supported by hybrid teams combining on‑shore, near-shore and off-shore expertise. This know-how from many international markets creates additional flexibility and quality in implementation and is a response to the rapidly changing requirements in the international media business.\n\nCustomer focus: media optimisation along the entire customer journey.The new model consistently focuses on the customer journey – from the first impulse, the first encounter, all the way to vehicle purchase. Target groups are addressed more precisely, delivering even greater emotional and situation-specific impact. The transition to a more performance-focused planning approach, where factors such as real-time data and sales targets play a key role, significantly increases the measurable impact of media communications. At the same time, the planning approach supports direct sales and aids the transformation towards a sustainable retail model.\n\nSustainability and responsibility in media communications.Another key consideration in the BMW Group’s choice of agency partner was sustainability. This aspect was systematically integrated into the evaluation of potential agency partners. Examples include production processes marked by a reduced carbon footprint and ethically transparent media bookings.

Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) dominated the premiere of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at the brand-new Balaton Park Circuit in Hungary. Just like at Misano (ITA) and Donington Park (GBR), ‘El Turco’ was unstoppable on his BMW M 1000 RR from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team at Lake Balaton. He secured pole position and won all three races – often with a commanding lead and with the fastest lap each time. His victory in the Superpole Race on Sunday morning was historic as it marked the 1000th race in WorldSBK history. In the riders’ championship, Razgatlioglu extended his lead from four to 26 points. In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW, currently in second, reduced the gap to leader Ducati to just 16 points.\n\nHis teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) finished 12th in the first main race. In the Superpole Race under changing conditions, he was unlucky in the tyre lottery and ended up 15th. He was 16th in the second main race. Van der Mark is travelling directly from Hungary to Japan, where he will compete in next weekend’s Suzuka 8 Hours, the third round of the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. WorldSBK now heads into the summer break, with round nine of the season scheduled for the first weekend of September at Magny-Cours (FRA).\n\nReactions after the Balaton Park Circuit round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a truly historic weekend for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Celebrating a win in the 1000th WorldSBK race with Toprak at the debut of the new Balaton Park Circuit, achieving another triple victory, and extending the championship lead – this is simply fantastic for us. Huge thanks to the entire team on site, the crews in Munich and Berlin, and all BMW employees and fans who supported us. We're on track and already looking forward to Magny-Cours. We’ll also use the summer break to intensively support Michael van der Mark and bring him back into the top ten. But first, our full focus together is now on the Suzuka 8 Hours, where we’re already heading. We are confident that Mickey, with his experience as a four-time winner of that race, will be a great asset to our FIM EWC team.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a wonderful weekend – not only because of our success, but also because of the great atmosphere here. It was fantastic to race in Hungary again after such a long time. Great people, a great track, and excellent infrastructure: we really enjoyed it. The circuit suited Toprak well; there’s a lot of stop-and-go, which plays to his strengths and those of the bike. His skill, combined with the strengths of our BMW M 1000 RR in braking and acceleration, created a perfect combination. We celebrated another triple win, and the championship battle remains tight. It’s also important that we made significant progress in the manufacturers’ standings and are just 16 points behind now. We’re very happy and looking forward to a short but intense summer break, to come back all-in at Magny-Cours.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “For me, it has been an amazing weekend. That was a new track for everyone and we started the weekend strongly on Friday. I quickly adapted to the circuit and we did a very good job. I am very happy for that! The Superpole Race was a little bit difficult because there were many wet patches, we had just one dry line and some corners were also still wet. But we did a very good job, no mistake, I was just riding and focused on the pace. That race was very important for me because I had won the 800th and the 900th and now also the 1000th WorldSBK race so this was a very special race for me to win. I am not focused on the championship, I just focus in every race to win it. The next races will be at Magny-Cours. Last year I did not ride there, and I am looking forward to go there. I will try to get another hat-trick there. Like Portugal, this is one of my favourite tracks. We need to win there, in France, and at Estoril, as I think that Ducati will be very strong at Aragón and Jerez. Now we have a longer break and I will enjoy some holiday but I also need to work a lot. We have increased our lead in the championship but everything is possible in the races so we need to try to get as many wins as possible.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I was looking forward to racing here in Hungary as it is always exciting to enter uncharted territory and it’s fun to learn new circuits. Race one was pretty solid and that made me confident for Sunday. Unfortunately, the unpredictable weather in the Superpole Race made the tyre choice a real gamble. We opted for intermediates, but could see during the race that everyone who made the same choice seemed to struggle. In race two, I unfortunately had a small crash that dropped me to the back of the field but it’s time to put that Sunday behind me. I am on my way now to Suzuka, to a race that I really love. I will give my very best to help BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team to achieve their big goal: to win the Suzuka 8 Hours as the first European manufacturer.”\n\nAir temperature: 27°, track temperature: 37°, humidity: 56%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 32°, track temperature: 41°, humidity: 45%, conditions: dry, laps: 20 (after red flag).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 7, 1:39.732 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 21°, track temperature: 27°, humidity: 83%, conditions: wet, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 9, 1:40.649\n\nAir temperature: 22°, track temperature: 30°, humidity: 79%, conditions: dry, laps: 21.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 7, 1:39.384 (new record)\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R08/12, after 24 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R08/12, after 24 of 36 races)."}

Two extraordinary custom bikes from the Bavarian Forest made their debut at the BMW Motorrad Days 2025: the #R 12 and #R 18 builds by [WOIDWERK]. Under the project name “The Speed Sisters,” Ralf Eggl – founder and creative force behind [WOIDWERK] – crafted two unique interpretations that captivated both motorcycle enthusiasts and custom scene insiders in Garmisch.\n\nThe goal of the project was to portray the BMW Motorrad cruiser models R 12 and R 18 as a custom-built sibling pair – stylistically connected, but deliberately not identical: “Sisters, not twins,” as Roland Stocker, Project Manager Heritage BMW Motorrad, puts it. Execution was led by Ralf Eggl, the visionary behind [WOIDWERK], with BMW Motorrad providing the two Boxer base bikes: a BMW R 12 as a dynamic retro cruiser and a BMW R 18 as a bold, powerful statement bike. The result is a custom duo that not only highlights the technical and stylistic relationship between the two models but also gives each its own distinct identity.\n\n[WOIDWERK]’s interpretation of the BMW R 12 emphasizes lightness, agility, and a modern design language. The rear section was heavily shortened in classic bobber style, giving it a clean, minimalist look, while the riding position was made sportier thanks to a new handlebar, modified foot pegs, and a custom leather-and-Alcantara seat.\n\nA bespoke tank cover with Alcantara surface was CAD-designed and 3D-printed. Like on the R 18, it bears the project logo – a striking sign of the family connection. A chassis raised by 15 mm, featuring a Wilbers shock absorber, enables an actively engaged riding position. The sporty setup is further underscored by a deep-black exhaust system from Hattech with a special ceramic coating – understated in tone, yet always present.\n\nThe taillight design features elegant Kellermann Jetstream sequential indicators styled like aircraft wings, seamlessly integrated into a tailor-made, filigree tail cowl. The paintwork, executed by Lackierzentrum Hirsch, reflects the distinct color concept of the “Speed Sisters.”\n\nThe big sister also received a comprehensive custom makeover. Raising and narrowing the tank by 30 mm, along with a floating, selfsupporting seat and handcrafted “Targa hoop”, made the bike’s silhouette noticeably more dynamic.\n\nA 20 mm chassis lift, using a Wilbers shock absorber, enhances the R 18’s commanding presence. Media information Date 5 November 2024 Topic BMW Motorrad presents the BMW Concept F 450 GS. Page 3 BMW Motorrad Corporate Communications The overall look and feel were sharpened both technically and visually: The standard braking system was upgraded to a high-performance radial setup – featuring 320 mm brake discs and radial brake calipers from the BMW R 1300 GS. This not only enhanced the sportiness visually, but also significantly improved braking performance.\n\nMany components – from fairing brackets to the taillight housing to the signature swingarm end cap with integrated license plate holder – were custom-designed, CNC-milled, or 3D-printed. The indicator and taillight mounts on the swingarm are also in-house developments, reflecting [WOIDWERK]’s attention to detail.\n\nThe black ceramic-coated exhaust system by Hattech delivers a throaty sound that perfectly complements the muscular lines. As with the R 12, the individually crafted seat in leather and Alcantara with visible hand-stitching was created by Zinteriors.\n\nBoth bikes share a distinctive color scheme symbolizing the seasons of the Bavarian Forest: ¾ white, ¼ green – a tongue-in-cheek reference to the region’s famously long winters. This color ratio is reflected in the paintwork, seat upholstery, and the green-tinted fairing screens – a creative detail that drew much attention in Garmisch. “These are the colors of the Bavarian Forest,” says Ralf Eggl. “As we say here: Three-quarters of the year is winter, and the other quarter is cold – that’s the Bavarian Forest.”\n\nThe unveiling of “The Speed Sisters” at the BMW Motorrad Days 2025 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen created a real buzz among the crowd. The fusion of craftsmanship, attention to detail, and technical finesse won widespread praise, quickly making the bikes crowd favorites. Roland Stocker, Project Manager Heritage BMW Motorrad: “When Ralf Eggl said, ‘The Bavarian Forest is our home, and BMW is our passion,’ we knew [WOIDWERK] was the perfect partner for this project. His style blends local craftsmanship with technical sophistication and gives the two cruisers a new, authentic expression.”\n\nFor over a decade, [WOIDWERK] has stood for premium BMW-based custom builds – defined by precision craftsmanship, deep regional roots, and a distinct design language. With “The Speed Sisters,” Ralf Eggl once again proves his keen sense for form, function, and the brand DNA of BMW Motorrad.\n\nThis project confirms once more: customizing a BMW is more than just a question of style – it’s a statement of attitude, creativity, and true passion for motorcycles.\n\nPress material on BMW motorcycles in the BMW Group PressClub at"}

Calculation of the personal footprint is based on two central sets of figures.\n\nReady for electric mobility: My BMW App helps with the transition.\n\nThe My BMW App also includes the Electric Vehicle Analysis introduced last summer. This function allows customers whose BMW is powered by a combustion engine to simulate how well a fully electric BMW fits their personal driving profile. Here, the customer selects an electric BMW model as an alternative vehicle in the app. Once the combustion-engined model has made at least 200 journeys and covered a distance of 2,000 kilometres (over 1,240 miles), the analysis shows the journeys the user could have completed on a single charge with the electric vehicle selected, and also flags up charging stations close to frequently visited destinations. More than 100,000 customers had used this analysis by May 2025.\n\nOver 14 million customers around the world use the My BMW App and MINI App. The My Trips function is available in more than 90 countries and is actively used by 1.9 million users.\n\n* The new function is available to users of vehicles for which a TÜV-certified carbon footprint has been calculated. The feature will launch in Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Luxemburg and Switzerland, and be available in the BMW 1 Series (code 81GE), BMW 2 Series (31GH), BMW X2 (71GM, 21GM), BMW X3 (11GR, 31GP, 65GP), BMW 5 Series (31FK, 11JF, 71FJ), BMW 5 Series Touring (11HH, 11GW, 21GV), BMW M5 (81FK) and BMW iX (41CF) and MINI Cooper (11GC), MINI Cooper C (11GD), MINI Aceman (31GC) and MINI Countryman (41GA, 11GA)."}

During the third Sprint weekend of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Valentino Rossi (ITA) celebrated another emotional home victory. At the wheel of the Team WRT #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, the local hero triumphed alongside Raffaele Marciello (SUI) in Saturday’s race in front of numerous euphoric fans in Emilia-Romagna. With this, Rossi secured his third consecutive win at the Misano World Circuit, following his victories in 2023 and 2024. Charles Weerts (BEL) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) completed a double podium for BMW M Motorsport by finishing third in Saturday’s one-hour sprint on the Adriatic coast.\n\nOn Sunday, the Belgian-South African duo in the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Team WRT staged a remarkable comeback, defending their lead in the Sprint Cup standings. In a race interrupted for more than two hours by a red flag, van der Linde and Weerts fought their way from 15th on the grid to fifth place, securing valuable points in the championship battle. One day after their victory, Rossi and Marciello were again in the fight for the win. Starting from second, Marciello repeatedly attacked for the lead. However, a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane dropped the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO far down the order.\n\nJens Klingmann (GER) and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) experienced a tough weekend. In the first qualifying session. Klingmann put the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from AlManar Racing by WRT on second place in the Gold category, but a start collision forced Klingmann to retire the car with damage—and also earned a 10-place grid penalty for the second race. Despite starting 35th on Sunday, Al Zubair and Klingmann fought their way into the top 20 and narrowly missed the Gold Cup podium by finishing fourth. Things went better for Gustav Bergström (SWE) and Gilles Stadsbader (BEL). After finishing fourth on Saturday, they manoeuvred the #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO to third in the Silver Cup, securing a class podium.\n\nIn the Bronze category, BMW M works driver Dan Harper and Darren Leung (both GBR) finished second in the Bronze Cup on Saturday. However, on Sunday, the British duo from Paradine Competition had no chance for a podium finish after receiving two penalties—one for the incident that caused the red flag, and one for an unsafe release. Their teammates Maxime Oosten and Mex Jansen (both NED) finished seventh and fifth in the Silver Cup races.\n\nPodium shower in the GT4 European Series\n\nIn the GT4 European Series, BMW M Motorsport teams had plenty of reason to celebrate. Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport claimed two podiums in the Silver class at Misano: on Saturday, the #12 BMW M4 GT4 EVO finished third, while on Sunday, the #11 car took second place. In the Am category, CHAZEL Technologie Course won both races with the #317 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. In the first race, Schubert Motorsport completed a BMW 1-2 finish in class with the #97, and the following day, their #98 BMW M4 GT4 EVO secured second place in the Pro-Am category. BMW brand colleagues from Team Continental Racing by Simpson Motorsport rounded off the strong weekend for BMW teams in GT4 with a third-place finish in class. On Saturday, W&D Racing Team also took third in Pro-Am.\n\nComments after the race.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to Team WRT, Valentino Rossi, and Raffaele Marciello for the win at Misano! That’s the third year in a row Valentino has triumphed at his home race. He once again proves what a phenomenal racer he has become on four wheels. It’s unfortunate things didn’t go ideally for Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts, but thanks to strong races, they still secured valuable championship points with P3 and P5. The title fight is still wide open. Thanks to everyone involved - I’m already looking forward to the next rounds of the GT World Challenge Europe at Magny-Cours.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, WRT): “It was a positive weekend. Congrats to Valentino and Raffaele for Saturday’s win—another success for the team at Misano which further extends our track record here. The #32 completed the double podium, and with fifth place on Sunday, they remain well placed in the championship. The #777 had a tough time in the Gold Cup, unfortunately. But congratulations to the #30 crew for the Silver Cup podium! Overall, we usually take even more points from Misano than we did this time—but let’s see what we can do at Magny-Cours.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 1st and 21st): “It was a very good weekend. We won a race, and just having a win on the board changes the whole season. I really enjoyed it, because we were competitive from the beginning. I drove well and kept improving throughout the weekend. Racing with Raffaele is a pleasure - he did an amazing job. The car was also very strong. The penalty on Sunday was really unfortunate - just a small mistake, but after the drive-through, the whole race was gone. Another podium would have been great. Maybe we could even have fought for a second win of the weekend.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 1st and 21st): “Overall, it was a very good weekend. The win on Saturday - especially sharing it with Valentino in front of the amazing Italian fans - was fantastic. Unfortunately, I made a small mistake entering the pits on Sunday and we got a penalty. That was disappointing, because a second podium would’ve been a perfect way to finish the weekend.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd and 5th): “Mixed feelings after this weekend. We came to Misano with very high expectations, and we weren’t quite able to meet them. Still, third and fifth place are important points for the championship. We're still leading the Sprint Cup, which is a positive. We now head to some circuits that might be a bit tougher for us. Hopefully, we can find some more performance and come back stronger.”\n\nCharles Weerts (Team WRT, #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd and 5th): “We definitely expected to be stronger. Third and fifth weren’t what we were hoping for, especially on a track that usually suits us well - and with the championship entering a crucial stage. Unfortunately, a few unexpected challenges affected our performance. There are areas we need to analyse more closely, but we’ll keep pushing.”\n\nJens Klingmann (AlManar Racing by WRT, #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF and 4th in Gold Cup): “It was a difficult weekend for us. What hurts most is that we actually had a very strong car, but couldn’t turn that into results. That makes the disappointment even bigger. On the positive side, we’re making progress as a team from race to race, which gives us hope for the rest of the season - even though we’ve fallen behind in the standings.”\n\nDan Harper (Paradine Competition, #991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd and 8th in Bronze Cup): “I really enjoyed being back with Darren and Paradine Competition. We always have fun and they give me a fast car. The podium on Saturday was great - and the champagne tasted good too! Unfortunately, the Ferrari ahead of us was too strong, and Darren couldn’t make up points in Bronze. On Sunday, Darren was involved in the big crash. The most important thing is that all drivers are okay. That shows how safe our GT3 cars are nowadays. In that sense, it was a very lucky day. From a sporting perspective, we had no chance after the penalties - but the car was fast, and I still got to put in some good laps.”"}

I can’t thank Paul Miller Racing and BMW M Motorsport enough for giving me a car that made this possible. I’m overjoyed with my first pole,” said the 24-year-old after Saturday’s qualifying. In the GTD-PRO category race, Verhagen and his compatriot Madison Snow finished sixth in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Paul Miller Racing.

BMW M Team WRT secured fifth place with the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at the fifth round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) in São Paulo (BRA). René Rast (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), and Marco Wittmann (GER) delivered strong performances both in qualifying, where they achieved fifth place, and in the 6-hour race. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 fell back early in the race due to technical issues. In the LMGT3 class, both BMW M4 GT3 EVO crews demonstrated fighting spirit in a challenging race.\n\nSheldon van der Linde drove the qualifying session on Saturday, stepping in for Robin Frijns (NED), who was competing in Formula E at the same time, and secured fifth on the grid. During the race, car #20 consistently remained in the front midfield but was slightly set back by a drive-through penalty. In the final stint, van der Linde closed the gap to the Peugeot ahead and secured fifth place with an impressive overtaking manoeuvre shortly before the finish. Wittmann, returning to the FIA WEC, proved to be an excellent substitute for Frijns. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), started from eighth place but had to return to the pits after just a few laps due to brake issues. Following a 45-minute repair, the trio finished the race in 17th place.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs were unable to keep up with the leaders throughout the weekend. Despite flawless performances and the determination of the drivers and teams, they could not overcome the deficit. Starting from 14th and 17th on the grid, the best results in the race were tenth place for car #46 and twelfth for the #31 car.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Congratulations to BMW M Team WRT and the car #20 crew on a strong weekend. Sheldon van der Linde impressed in qualifying and with his spectacular overtaking manoeuvre against the Peugeot at the end. René Rast delivered two excellent opening stints, and Marco Wittmann was an outstanding substitute for Robin Frijns. It was a solid performance, and we extracted the maximum that was possible for us here. The early brake issues with car #15 are very frustrating and unfortunate for the drivers and the team. We will thoroughly analyse this afterwards. I feel sorry for our LMGT3 crews. They showed great fighting spirit during the race, but ultimately, given the performance levels of the different cars this weekend, we had no chance of achieving top positions. This is especially bitter for Augusto Farfus and Pedro Ebrahim at their home race. Many thanks to everyone involved for their efforts! Now, after some intense weeks, we’ll take a breather and aim to come back even stronger at the next race in Austin.\"\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): \"Fifth place for car #20 is the result of an almost flawless race by our team. Even without the drive-through penalty, there wasn’t more in it. That made us the ‘best of the rest’ here. That’s good, but we want to be on the podium. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough this time. We’ll need to carefully analyse the cause of the brake issues with car #15. At the moment, we can’t say anything definitive. In the LMGT3 class, we probably had the best-executed races we’ve ever had in the FIA WEC with both cars. Finishing tenth and twelfth says it all, I think.\"\n\nRené Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 5th place): \"We can be satisfied with the result. It was a calm weekend. We got the maximum out of it; there wasn’t more in it. Our pace wasn’t where we wanted it to be, but we were error-free and had a good strategy. Overall, it’s fine, but unfortunately, we were still a bit too slow this time.\"\n\nKevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 17th place): \"It was an unfortunate race for us. The brake issue took away all our chances very early on. Unfortunately, these things can happen. We’ve had some bad luck a few times this season. Hopefully, we can bounce back in the remaining races.\"\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 10th place): \"Of course, tenth place isn’t what we came for. We wanted more, we wanted to fight for the podium, but considering our pace and how much we struggled in practice, it’s not bad. The race was good; we didn’t make any mistakes, and the team did a great job. We got the best possible result. But it is what it is. Everyone gave their maximum, even if the performance and pace weren’t fantastic. We’ll push again next time.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 12th place): \"It’s incredibly frustrating when you and your crew deliver a perfect race and simply have no chance to keep up with the leaders. Unfortunately, this was evident throughout the weekend. I loved racing in front of my fans in my home country again, but I would have liked to present myself as more competitive on the track. Under the given circumstances, that was impossible.\""}

After winning race one on Saturday and the Superpole Race on Sunday morning – which also marked BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s 100th podium in WorldSBK – he went on to win the second main race as well, taking over the lead in the riders’ standings. After seven of twelve rounds, Razgatlioglu now holds a four-point lead over Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati). His total of twelve wins at Donington Park also sets a new record. His teammate, Michael van der Mark (NED), suffered a series of setbacks in the UK through no fault of his own. He finished 13th on Saturday and retired from both races on Sunday. The season continues from 25th to 27th July at the brand-new Balaton Park Circuit in Hungary.\n\nReactions after the Donington Park round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an incredible weekend for us, putting us back in the lead of the world championship – right where we belong. I think a lot of people wrote us off after the season opener in Australia. I’m incredibly proud of the team, the engineers at home, the test team, all the mechanics, and everyone else who puts in tireless effort. No one gave up – everyone worked to bring us back to the front, to fight for victories again, and now to lead the championship. Toprak did an unbelievable job. He’s back in his flow, and you can feel his mental strength. Nothing can shake him. Everyone works with full focus from the first free practice to the final race. We are immensely proud of that. Unfortunately, Mickey had an extremely tough weekend here, and together we will do everything to bring him back to the front as well. Lastly, on behalf of all at BMW Motorrad, I’d like to thank the team: to take the triple win at the home round is just fantastic.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This weekend at Donington brought unusually warm conditions, which presented a challenge for the entire paddock so Friday was initially a process of adaptation for us. We worked very intensively during the practice sessions to understand the bike under these conditions and grip levels. That worked out perfectly – the BMW M 1000 RR was spot on. From FP3 onward, the bike was in an ideal operating window, and for the rest of the weekend we only needed to fine-tune it. Toprak’s outstanding Superpole lap and race performances confirmed this. Unfortunately, Mickey’s weekend was severely impacted by his unavoidable crash in FP3 – he went down on oil left on the track following another rider’s engine failure. This triggered a chain of unfortunate events, requiring a lot of repair and analysis work. One thing led to another. We apologise to him and are confident he’ll bounce back in Hungary. It’s a new circuit for everyone, which makes it exciting. One of the strengths of both our riders is their ability to quickly adapt to new tracks, so we’re really looking forward to racing at Balaton Park Circuit.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I'm very happy because before I came here, my biggest target was the hat-trick. I love this track and I really like riding here. I’m enjoying it and now I have 12 wins here, so I broke the record. It’s of course also good to now be in the championship lead, but I’m not focused on that, I just focus from race to race and on winning them. The next races are at Balaton which is new for everyone. We will see there. I hope we will win there, too. The circuit is a bit difficult but also suits my style a bit. But we will see. We will work hard and then we are ready to fight for the win again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This has been a very tough one. It seemed that the odds were against us this weekend. There was this crash on oil I couldn’t avoid in FP3, then we were struggling with different technical issues. Everyone worked really hard but the only reward we got was the points from race one.

For the second consecutive time, BMW M Team Redline has triumphed at the Esports World Cup (EWC). On Friday, Luke Bennett (GBR), Sebastian Job (GBR), Jeffrey Rietveld (NED), and Kevin Siggy (SLO) secured victory in the grand finale against strong competition, earning a prize of 200,000 USD. Over the course of the four-day competition on the \"Rennsport\" platform, the Redline quartet once again demonstrated their exceptional class and were rewarded with the title for their consistently strong performances. The two other virtual BMW M teams – MOUZ and BS+COMPETITION – finished in sixth and eighth place overall, respectively .\n\nBMW M Team Redline reached the so-called \"Finalist Mode\" on the final day after six races, having surpassed the 250-point threshold.

Congratulations to the four drivers and the entire Redline team behind the scenes. 'Automotive Gaming' is a strategically significant field for BMW M because it uniquely combines emotion, technology, and new target audiences. We prepared our teams specifically for the major challenge of the EWC. The fact that Redline has won the title again, and that MOUZ and BS+COMPETITION were also able to compete at the world’s top level, confirms our approach. Virtual motorsport has long been an integral part of BMW M Motorsport – and a very successful one at that.\"\n\nIn June, the BMW M Motorsport teams took the opportunity to prepare for the Esports World Cup in an extraordinary way, stepping away from their usual simulator routines. The twelve drivers from the three teams gathered in Munich (GER) before heading to the remote Kaisertal in Tyrol – a retreat far from digital distractions, accessible only on foot. Surrounded by the Alps, the focus for participants was on mental concentration, self-reflection, and teamwork. Accompanied by experienced mountain guides, they engaged in intensive outdoor sessions, team challenges, and mindfulness exercises – a deliberate preparation for the mental pressure of an international live event.\n\nReactions to BMW M Team Redline's victory at the Esports World Cup:\n\nLuke Bennett (BMW M Team Redline): \"What a fantastic journey over the past two years with BMW M Motorsport and amazing people!

Passion for motorsports, design, and, of course, BMW Motorrad.\n\nA small group of BMW Motorrad employees had the opportunity to bring this passion to life. As part of an extraordinary project, Philipp Ludwig served as project manager, vehicle designer Andreas Martin, Theresa Stukenbrock as colour and graphic designer, and prototype builders Paul Summerer and Thomas Becker, who brought their experience and passion to the project, worked together to create a unique vehicle.\n\nThe BMW R 1300 R \"TITAN\" - brute and aggressive, beautiful and extraordinary, fast and precise - built to win.\n\nIts design incorporates the basic styling elements of the new BMW R 1300 R, translating them into the aggressive lines of a sprint racer.\n\nThe characteristic lines of the BMW R 1300 R tank and fairing are reflected in the monocoque typical of racing machines and the striking air duct panel of the standard machine continues the dynamics of the \"TITAN\" in an exaggerated sense.\n\nVisually, the weight is pushed over the front wheel to keep it on the tarmac for as long as possible when starting off.\n\nThe motorcycle's overall proportions are compactly built around the centrepiece: the 1300cc boxer engine. It also resembles a predatory cat, patiently waiting to sprint off even when stationary.\n\nIn contrast to the forged carbon-fibre underneath, the striking graphic captures the impression of movement with a modern, clear interpretation complemented by metallic blue accents.\n\nAkrapovic, a long-standing BMW Motorrad partner, assisted in developing the BMW R 1300 R \"TITAN.\" This collaboration enabled the team to design a comprehensive titanium Akrapovic exhaust system that enhances the powerful character of this custom bike, both visually and acoustically. The exhaust runs out of the two cylinders, comes together briefly under the bike, and ends in a boxer-style, two-flow outlet under the towering, aggressively rising rear end.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R has a low profile on the tarmac, supported by a specially manufactured Wilbers chassis with a long swinging arm. This chassis is hard-tuned to ensure that no performance of the series-production engine is wasted.\n\nAn aggressive-looking nitrous oxide bottle sits between the two titanium rear silencers, injecting the injection system with nitrous oxide at the touch of a button. This propels the rider and machine toward the finish line with extra power.\n\nOnce the oxygen transporter arrives in the engine, the sheer power thrusts the tires into the tarmac via the transmission and shaft drive, catapulting the BMW R 1300 R \"TITAN\" forward.\n\nThe gears slot into place precisely and the Magura HC3 brake lever recaptures the released energy after the finish line, decelerating the bike to a stop.\n\nThe footrests extend far to the rear, providing Philipp with the necessary support during sprint races.\n\nThe BMW R 1300 R \"TITAN\" is a custom bike that embodies BMW Motorrad's passion and precision in every detail!\n\nYou will find press material on BMW motorcycles in the BMW Group PressClub at \n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nTim Diehl-Thiele, Head of Communications BMW Motorrad\n\nIngo Wirth Head of Communication MINI and BMW Motorrad\n\nInternet:"}

Englishmen Daniel Brown and Jordan Smith, teeing off in the final group, began the final round with a spectacular flurry of birdies that delighted the crowds in Munich. Smith came into the Sunday one shot behind his compatriot, but overcame that deficit with five birdies on the first nine holes. Brown, for his part, hit back with four birdies. However, unlike his playing partner, he did not drop a single shot and was ultimately a worthy winner of the only DP World Tour event in Germany. The 30-year-old carded rounds of 70, 65, 65 and 66 to end the tournament on 22 under par (266 shots) and claim his second title on the DP World Tour.\n\n“At the end of a fantastic tournament week, it is my pleasure, on behalf of BMW, to congratulate Daniel Brown on his deserved title at the 36th BMW International Open,” said Jochen Goller, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Customer, Brands, Sales. “The atmosphere around the course was sensational. It was great to see so many fans, customers and friends of the game of golf here. We are also delighted with the many eagles that were carded, namely 73, meaning the BMW Group will donate € 73,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education.”\n\nThis year, the BMW Group donated €1,000 for every eagle scored over the course of the tournament to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The shared goal is to give children and young people skills and knowledge in the areas of exercise, nutrition and personal development. This is the third time that the BMW Group has used its “Eagles for Education” initiative at the BMW International Open to work towards equal opportunity and better prospects for children and young people who have a difficult start to life. The 73 eagles at this year’s tournament is a record for “Eagles for Education”.\n\nMaking his 69th appearance on the DP World Tour, Brown became the eighth Englishman to win the iconic German tournament. In doing so, he followed in the footsteps of Matt Wallace (2018), Danny Willett (2012), David Horsey (2010), Nick Dougherty (2009), David Howell (2005), Lee Westwood (2003) and Russell Claydon (1998). Brown had his low error count to thank for the victory – over the course of the whole tournament, he only dropped three shots – as well as a nerveless final round. Smith carded three bogeys on the final nine holes and must consequently – as he did last year – settle for second place, despite having had a very good tournament.\n\n“It means an awful lot to me. I did not really take it all in when I claimed my first victory but today hit me straight away. I lost a friend last weekend. This is for him. All day, it felt as though I was not playing in my own body. I could feel the tension and then I started to think what it would mean to win a golf tournament like this. That repressed what happened a little. I believe he was with me, and that made it a bit easier,” said a visibly emotional Brown.\n\nThird place went to Japan-born New Zealander Kazuma Kobori (-18), who thrilled the 17,500 golf fans on Sunday with a round of 63 (9 under par) – the best of the week, together with Davis Bryant (USA, round two). A total of 58,000 visitors flocked to Golfclub München Eichenried over the course of the week. Bryant, Joost Luiten (NED) and Kristoffer Reitan (NOR all -16) ended the tournament tied in fourth place.\n\nThe best-placed German at this year’s BMW International Open was Matti Schmid (-15, T7). The man from Regensburg, who predominantly plays in the USA on the PGA TOUR, said: “The atmosphere was more than mega all week. I hope everyone comes back again, as it is nice to have a full house here. I am obviously happy with the result, as the top ten is always a super outcome. My performance was mixed. On the whole, there was more there for me – however, I assume everyone feels that way. I felt very good on the greens. At some point, everything will come together at the same time.”\n\nMunich-born Tim Wiedemeyer also gave an outstanding display. He made the cut without any problems and ended the week as the top amateur. The 20-year-old did not stray above par on any of his four rounds (72, 66, 69, 69) and finished tied in an impressive 17th place. Wiedemeyer said: “It was really cool. I missed out a few times, and could definitely have done better, but I am very happy with the result. I could take something from the tournament in all areas of the game. The walk to the 18th green on the final day was the best moment of the week.”\n\nSeven German players made it to the weekend: Martin Kaymer (-11, T19), Marcel Schneider (-10, T26), Marcel Siem (-4, T58), Yannik Paul and Hurly Long (both Even Par, T66).\n\nThe full final result of the 36th BMW International Open can be found in the PDF document attached."}

René Rast (GER) managed to limit the damage for Schubert Motorsport during an overall disappointing DTM race weekend at the Norisring (GER). Thanks to strong fighting performances in both races, he secured valuable championship points with tenth and seventh-place finishes. Marco Wittmann (GER) endured a frustrating home event. After finishing 18th on Saturday, he was forced to retire on Sunday in the very first lap due to an unavoidable accident. Meanwhile, there was reason to celebrate in ADAC GT4 Germany.\n\nOn the tight street circuit in Nürnberg, Rast and Wittmann lacked the tools to secure top qualifying positions. However, Rast made significant progress in both races, climbing from 17th and 11th on the grid to finish 10th and 7th, respectively. On Sunday, he was as low as 14th at the time of the restart following Wittmann’s crash but managed to move up significantly thanks to strong performances by both himself and the team. Rast remains within striking distance of the championship lead, sitting on 90 points, just 19 points behind the leader. Schubert Motorsport is third in the team standings with 155 points. For Marco Wittmann, his home event was a frustrating experience. On Saturday, he lacked the pace to move forward from his starting position, finishing 18th. On Sunday, his race ended in the very first corner when he was squeezed by several competitors and pushed into the wall, leaving him with no chance to continue.\n\nADAC GT4 Germany: Double podium for Besler/Piana.The ADAC GT4 Germany races were much more successful for BMW M Motorsport teams. BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler (TUR) and Gabriele Piana (ITA) delivered standout performances in the #21 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from FK Performance Motorsport. The duo, fresh from their first win of the season in the GT4 European Series a week earlier, continued their strong form with second-place finishes in both races at the Norisring. On Saturday, three BMW M4 GT4 EVOs finished in the top ten, and on Sunday, four cars achieved the same feat. Among them was the car of BMW M Racing Academy member Niels Tröger (GER), who, alongside Andreas Jochimsen (DEN), finished sixth and eighth.\n\nStatements after the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “We are all disappointed after this very mixed weekend, especially because the Norisring is such an important event for our partner Schaeffler. I feel very sorry for Marco Wittmann and his fans that his race ended so early on Sunday. What René Rast achieved on Sunday, moving from 14th at the restart to finish 7th, was impressive. Unfortunately, we couldn’t position our cars at the front in qualifying, which makes it very difficult to move forward on such a short track. On the other hand, ADAC GT4 Germany went very well. I’m delighted with the two podium finishes for FK Performance Motorsport and drivers Berkay Besler and Gabriele Piana. Both Berkay and Niels Tröger, our BMW M Racing Academy members, delivered strong performances at the Norisring.”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “These were tough races for us. It was clear that other manufacturers were significantly faster than us at the Norisring. On Sunday, we managed to move René forward with a good strategy and strong pit stops, extracting the maximum. It’s a real shame for Marco that he was pushed into the wall through no fault of his own in the very first corner of his home race on Sunday. We are now fully focused on being more competitive at the Nürburgring. We’ll also be there with the ADAC GT Masters before the DTM and hope to gain valuable insights.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 10th place, R2: 7th place): “It was a tough weekend for us. We didn’t have the speed we needed to compete at the front. Thanks to the team’s great work, I was able to make up many positions in both races and extract nearly the maximum. We’ll take the points and haven’t lost too much ground in the standings. It was damage limitation. Now we’ll focus on doing better next time.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 18th place, R2: DNF): “A very disappointing weekend for me. We struggled from the start and never had the pace to aim for a top ten or top five result. Then, to be pushed into the wall in the first corner of my home race on Sunday is disheartening. There was nothing I could do in that situation. The only positive was the fantastic fans, who once again made the Norisring event unique.”"}

It was long, it was loud, it was spectacular. On Saturday, right after the third round of the 36th BMW International Open, the 18th green in front of the main grandstand transformed into a long drive arena. During the “Launch Control” event, top-tier long drivers faced off in an adrenaline-charged show match. Also taking part were content creators Wesley and George Bryan (USA) as well as Peter Finch (ENG), all highly skilled golfers who proved their talent.\n\nIn the so-called celebrity matches, Finch came out on top with a 330-meter drive against Wesley Bryan. The only woman in the field, long driver Cassandra Meyer (USA), bravely took on George Bryan and narrowly lost with a drive of 320 meters to his 322.\n\nThe professional long drive competition was played in a semifinal and final format. “Long Way” Bobby Ray (USA) surprisingly beat Ryan “The Canadian Lumberjack” Gregnol in the first semifinal with a 400-meter drive. German world champion Martin Borgmeier advanced to the final with a 405-meter blast against Sam Judah (USA). And the best was saved for last: Borgmeier claimed victory with the longest hit of the evening - a massive 425-meter drive to edge out Ray, who posted 408 meters."}

Rising all the way to the top was England’s Daniel Brown, who carded a 65 on Saturday to take the lead at 16 under par. His round of 65 was the best score of the day, matched by Dutchman Joost Luiten (-13, 3rd) and Spain’s Ivan Cantero (-11, T9). Just one stroke behind Brown is fellow Englishman, Jordan Smith (-15), who shot a 66.\n\nFrom a German perspective, the biggest movers were Matti Schmid (-10, T12) and amateur Tim Wiedemeyer (-9, T17). Marcel Schneider (today -2, total -8, T20), Martin Kaymer (-2, -6, T34), Yannik Paul (-1, -5, T41), Marcel Siem (+2, -5, T41), and Hurly Long (-1, -4, T53) were unable to improve their positions.\n\nBrown made just one bogey on Saturday and claimed the top spot on the leaderboard thanks to a fantastic back nine featuring four birdies and one eagle. The 30-year-old, who celebrated his only win on the DP World Tour in 2023, credited his performance to a sense of ease: “I actually didn’t play or control the ball as well as I did yesterday, but the final holes went really well. I was just in a flow, felt no pressure all day, was very relaxed, and had fun with my caddie.”\n\nThe largest deficit ever overcome by a BMW International Open winner on Sunday is five shots - a feat achieved by five players since the tournament began in 1989: Mark McNulty (IRL, 1994), Frank Nobilo (NZL, 1995), David Horsey (ENG, 2010), Fabrizio Zanotti (PAR, 2014), and, most recently, Pablo Larrazábal (ESP, 2015).\n\nAlthough Matti Schmid posted the best round among the German players with a 68, the Regensburg native remains six shots behind Brown - just outside the comeback “window.” Two late bogeys on holes 16 and 17 kept him from scoring even lower in an otherwise flawless round. Still, the 27-year-old was thrilled with the atmosphere on course and hasn’t given up hope: “There are so many golf fans out here creating an incredible level of support. You can only draw energy from an atmosphere like this. Every good shot is cheered. It definitely gives you a positive feeling. On the front nine I hit almost nothing and had a lot of bad drives. But I had a great short game and putted well. The back nine was really solid. Overall, I’m happy with that. You really have to hit good shots here to score well. But with the par-5s and hole 16, which is attackable, there are birdie chances out there. Martin Kaymer shot 8 under in the final round back in 2021 - something like that is what we’ll need.”\n\nAmateur Tim Wiedemeyer continued to impress. In his hometown, the 20-year-old shot a 69 and now sits at 9 under par, maintaining his spot inside the top 20. “The atmosphere out there was great,” Wiedemeyer said. “There were a lot of people I know in the crowd. It’s just a cool vibe, and the support really helps you play well. After making the cut, everything was pretty relaxed anyway. I mean, I’ve got nothing to lose here. I know where I stand - I’m still an amateur. I’m just having fun, learning a few things, and we’ll see what happens tomorrow.”\n\nMartin Kaymer - still the only German winner of the BMW International Open since 2008 and the youngest in tournament history - likely won’t add a second title this year, but was still satisfied with his performance in Munich: “Two under par is okay, but it doesn’t get you anywhere,” said the two-time major champion. “You really need one low round in this tournament to climb the leaderboard. I didn’t hit enough fairways today. If I do tomorrow, I can create a lot of chances. I might play a bit more aggressively. I feel good around the greens and have had lots of up-and-downs this week. So I think I can allow myself to take a few more risks.”\n\nMarcel Siem, who had put himself in a strong weekend position after the first two rounds, experienced what he described as “a day to forget.” Two bogeys at the start and a triple-bogey on the par-5 6th derailed his round early. A spectacular eagle on the par-4 16th and a birdie on the final hole couldn’t salvage the day. “Of course it’s frustrating and sad to know you have no chance to win anymore,” Siem said. “Then I tried to make the impossible possible and just focused on eagles and aces to somehow get back into it for Sunday. But it is what it is - I’ve only got myself to blame.”\n\nSiem’s eagle was one of 56 made so far in the tournament. That means the “Eagles for Education” donation total from last year (€55,000) has already been surpassed in Round 3. For every eagle made during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group donates €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The shared goal is to equip children and young people with key skills in movement, nutrition, and personal development.\n\nThe final round at Golfclub München Eichenried begins on Sunday at 7:10 AM. The final pairing, featuring Brown and Smith, tees off at 1:10 PM. Please refer to the attachment for the full list of tee times."}

Davis Bryant had a sensational day at the BMW International Open. The American, who is playing his first season on the DP World Tour, started on the 10th hole, made a birdie on the 11th, and then aced the 12th hole (Par 3, 166 yards). He would go on to make eight more birdies, finishing the second round at 12 under par to take the lead. On an otherwise perfect day, the 25-year-old might only regret making his ace on the “wrong” hole. This year’s hole-in-one prize – a BMW M5 Touring – is awarded for an ace on the 17th hole, which remains in play over the weekend.\n\nClosest behind Bryant are Kristoffer Reitan (NOR, -10), along with Yuto Katsuragawa (JPN), Daniel Brown (ENG), and Jordan Smith (ENG), all at -9. “I honestly don’t know what happened today. The hole-in-one really got things going – that’s always incredibly cool,” said Bryant. “I’m just very proud of how I executed everything, stuck to my process, and holed some key putts. That was a big factor. The spark really lit today – and then you just ride that momentum.”\n\nBryant’s ace – contributing to making him the first American since John Daly (2001) who could potentially win the BMW International Open – was one of 28 eagles recorded on Friday. For every eagle made during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group is donating €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint initiative aims to equip children and youth with key life skills in movement, nutrition, and personal development. Heading into the weekend, the donation total already stands at €44,000.\n\nWhile Bryant and Reitan have created a slight gap, the leaderboard remains tightly packed, promising an exciting weekend of golf. A total of 68 players made the cut – including seven Germans. Among the most promising are Marcel Siem (-7, T10), Marcel Schneider, Matti Schmid, and the sensationally performing amateur Tim Wiedemeyer (all -6, T15).\n\nSiem said: “I’m very happy. Apart from the 9th hole, I took advantage of all the chances I had. All in all, I’m really satisfied with my 6-under round today. I don’t think much more was possible – I really got the maximum out of it. My goal is to start the weekend confidently and go at the flags more aggressively when I’m in the fairway. That’s my game plan.”\n\nSchneider was also pleased with his performance: “Today went better than yesterday. The putter got really hot at times. Overall, the ball-striking was better. It wasn’t perfect yet, but overall, I’m satisfied. The four early birdies definitely gave me a push. My plan is to keep playing well, attack the course, and hit a lot of greens. I’ll take it shot by shot and see where that gets me.”\n\nAmateur Tim Wiedemeyer has been playing impressive golf this week. In his hometown, the 20-year-old followed up his even-par opening round with a 66 today and said: “I’m very happy. Six under par is pretty good. I tried to hit a lot of fairways and greens. And when the putter gets hot, you shoot a good score. The support – especially on the back nine – was really cool. It felt more like an evening round with friends. That definitely helped my game today. Now, I just want to have fun. The cut is made – let’s see what happens and enjoy it.”\n\nFor Martin Kaymer (-4, T37), the dream of a second win in Munich after 2008 is still alive – albeit with a steep task ahead, sitting seven shots behind the leader. The two-time Major champion said: “Overall, I was satisfied with my game and hit a lot of good shots, but I didn’t take advantage of the par-5s. Those are the real birdie chances this week, and I missed out there. On this course – especially if the weather is good – you can really go low. Marcel proved that today. I know what I need to do tomorrow and hope to shoot a good round to still be in contention on Sunday.”\n\nCompleting the group of Germans playing on the weekend are Yannik Paul (-4, T37) and Hurly Long (-3, T53). Missing the cut (-3) were defending champion Ewen Ferguson (SCO), Masters champion Patrick Reed (USA), and Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald (ENG).\n\nFull tee times for round three are attached."}

This edition of Le Mans Classic marks a historic occasion with the return of the first #BMW Art Car by #Alexander Calder, in its Artist's Proof version, initiated by the Calder Foundation and BMW Group Classic, to the track where it all began 50 years ago. Hervé Poulain, the visionary behind the BMW Art Cars, and Alexander SC Rower, Calder's grandson, will take a ceremonial lap in this automotive artwork on Sunday, July 6, from 9:45 to 10:25am, during the BMW parade. This event pays vibrant tribute to the originality of the project, where art meets automotive, perpetuating a tradition that has lasted for half a century.\n\nAs a long-standing partner of Le Mans Classic, BMW celebrates this year the double anniversary of its iconic BMW Art Cars and the BMW 3 Series. Taking place from 4 to 6 July, Le Mans Classic brings together classic and vintage racing cars on the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans circuit, creating a strong link between historical heritage and contemporary innovation.\n\nThis strong presence on the Circuit de la Sarthe underlines BMW's long-standing commitment to the alliance between art and technology. The presentation of the first BMW Art Car marks a celebration of the artistic and technological journey, reinforcing the idea that past progress feeds future innovation. This iconic #BMW 3.0 CSL embodies a perfect balance of lightness, performance and bold aesthetics.\n\n2025 marks the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Cars, as well as the 50th anniversary of the BMW 3 Series, one of the world's best-selling premium cars with over 20 million units sold.\n\nOn this occasion, Hervé Poulain, co-founder of the BMW Art Cars, auctioneer and racing driver, will share his vision and emotions about the creation of the first Art Car and discuss the uniqueness of this visionary collection. Alexander SC Rower, president of the Calder Foundation and grandson of the artist, will talk about the importance of this rolling sculpture in his grandfather's artistic legacy. This meeting will be marked by the themes of transmission and passion.\n\nHervé Poulain says: \"I wanted to provoke a meeting between the major arts and industry, two worlds that ignored each other. The BMW Art Cars have transformed the status of the automobile by bringing this object born from applied arts into the fine art.” Looking to the future, he continues: “The automotive myth has undergone many transformations. Today, this myth is evolving as the 21st century promises unprecedented advancements. The BMW Art Car by Calder was born 50 years ago in reaction to the pessimism generated by the first oil shock, as a symbolic gesture of optimism and confidence in the future.”\n\n50 years of ‘rolling sculptures’: the BMW Art Car Collection\n\nSince 1975, renowned artists from around the world have created BMW Art Cars. The idea emerged thanks to French racing driver and art enthusiast Hervé Poulain, who, in collaboration with Jochen Neerpasch, then Head of Motorsport at BMW, invited his friend and artist Alexander Calder to paint a car. The result was a BMW 3.0 CSL that participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975, captivating the public and marking the birth of the BMW Art Car Collection. Famous figures such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer and Ólafur Elíasson have since enriched the collection with their unique styles. More recently, John Baldessari and Cao Fei have used the BMW M6 GTLM and BMW M6 GT3 respectively to add dynamic race cars to the collection, competing at Daytona in 2016 and Macau in 2017. The BMW Art Cars by Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu raced at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2010 and 2024.\n\nSince its beginnings, Le Mans Classic has provided a unique stage where more than 600 cars gather to pay tribute to the history of motorsport. BMW, a loyal partner of the event, showcases a range of iconic vehicles, symbols of this rich tradition. This year's Le Mans Classic poster honours the legendary #BMW M1 Procar, paying tribute to the cars that have marked the history of the greatest endurance race of all time.\n\nWith over 200,000 visitors expected, Le Mans Classic is much more than just a car gathering. It is a grand popular festival, enriched by parades and cultural activities that connect automotive history with the future. In this year of double celebration, BMW is highlighting its rich heritage while reaffirming its commitment to innovation and excellence.\n\nModels on display in the BMW area from 4 to 6 July:\n\nFurther information on the Calder BMW Art Car (Artist's Proof) can be found here.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}

The highlight of the virtual motorsport season is just around the corner – and the three official BMW M Motorsport teams are highly confident heading into the 2025 Esports World Cup (EWC). At the sim racing competition of the world’s largest esports tournament, BS+COMPETITION, MOUZ, and Team Redline will compete in Riyadh (KSA) from 8th to 11th July for a total prize pool of 500,000 US dollars. Team Redline will enter the event as reigning champions with a clear mission: to defend their title. In 2024, Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) also won the drivers' championship.\n\nAs in the previous year, the BMW M Motorsport teams, each with four drivers, came together in June for several days of intense preparation. The focus was on mental strength, self-control, mindfulness, and team cohesion – key success factors for a live event of this scale. From Munich (GER), the twelve brand ambassadors travelled to the remote Kaisertal in Tyrol (AUT), which can only be reached on foot. Accompanied by skilled mountain guides, the participants experienced exciting days away from the digital world – with outdoor activities, reflection sessions, and extraordinary physical challenges. The goal was to sharpen mental efficiency, better understand stress mechanisms, and build confidence in their own performance capabilities.\n\nTimo Brückner (Project Lead BMW M Automotive Gaming) said: “This preparation programme literally pushed our BMW M Motorsport drivers out of their comfort zones and made them stronger – physically, mentally, and as a team. The retreat in the mountains, the conscious disconnect from the digital day-to-day, the inspiring conversations, and the shared experiences created a new level of cohesion and focus. I’m confident that our teams will not only be extremely fast again at the Esports World Cup but will also stand out as exemplary ambassadors for BMW M Motorsport in the rapidly growing ‘automotive gaming’ segment. Our goal is to be at the very top again this year at the EWC – and we’ve laid the foundation for that together in the Tyrolean mountains.”\n\nThe teams qualified for the EWC during the R1 2025 Spring Season, which consisted of eight online events on the \"Rennsport\" platform.

Players and experts had agreed that the dry conditions of recent weeks would lead to low scores at the 36th BMW International Open (2–6 July 2025). Thursday's opening round told a different story however. Only 22 of the 156 players managed to post a score better than two under par – mainly due to unpredictable winds across the Championship Course. Five players sit tied at the top of the leaderboard at five under par: England’s Marco Penge, Gavin Green from Malaysia, the Netherlands’ Darius van Driel, Ugo Coussaud of France, and Wenyi Ding from China. “I’ve been looking forward to coming back to this golf course,” said Penge. “I really think that as a long hitter you have some real advantages out here.”\n\nThe best Germans after 18 holes are Marcel Schneider and Martin Kaymer (both -2), followed by Marcel Siem and Jannik de Bruyn at one under par, with Matti Schmid, Yannik Paul and standout amateur Tim Wiedemeyer all at even par. Siem and Kaymer, who played in the same group alongside Nicolai von Dellingshausen (+2) and drew the largest galleries of the day, experienced a round full of highs and lows. Kaymer (-3 over the final three holes) and Siem (-4 over the final four) finished strongly and secured solid starts to their tournament.\n\n“I’m actually quite satisfied with my game – today’s result puts me in the tournament,” said Kaymer. “I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s round. It’s just fun playing with these two guys. The atmosphere in our group was really positive.”\n\nSiem, who yesterday declared that winning the 36th BMW International Open was his clear goal, capped off a rollercoaster round with a widely celebrated eagle on the 18th green. “It was a tough day out there. It felt like nothing was really working,” Siem said. “But I never give up. That finish was awesome. I’m still in the tournament. At one point, it looked like I’d need to go really low tomorrow just to make the cut. I said what I came here to do – now I’ve still got a chance. I’m super happy with the way I finished.”\n\nVon Dellingshausen, who had played solid golf for much of the round, summed up his day and the key moment: “That triple bogey on 14 still hurts. Overall, it was mostly cruise control out there – par was rarely in danger. Then out of nowhere came that disaster shot into the nettles on 14 – and I kind of lost my rhythm. It was really just one hole, but the score was so high it messed up the round a bit.”\n\nSiem’s closing eagle was one of 16 eagles made on the day. For each eagle scored during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group donates €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint goal is to equip children and young people with valuable life skills in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, and personal development.\n\nOn Friday, it will be decided which players make it into the weekend. With the field tightly packed, a fierce and thrilling battle for the cut is expected. The first tee time is at 7:30 a.m., with Kaymer, Siem, and von Dellingshausen set to tee off at 7:50 a.m. from hole 10. Please refer to the attachment for the full list of tee times."}

Until today, the BMW CE 04 remains the undisputed market leader in the segment of all-electric motorcycles and scooters with an output of over 11 kW. The premium scooter has been specifically revised for this segment.\n\nThe Basic variant features Lightwhite uni body colour combined with a black-grey seat and clear windshield, giving the new BMW CE 04 a clean and consistent look.\n\nThe Avantgarde variant in the body colour Gravity blue metallic matt, combined with the contrasting colour Sao Paulo yellow, highlights the CE 04's dynamic and forward-thinking design. The Pro seat in black/light grey with yellow and white tapes, a yellow-tinted windshield, and a laser-engraved rear wheel rim complete the design.\n\nThe Exclusive variant features the Spacesilver metallic body colour combined with exclusive tapes, giving the CE 04 an especially elegant look. This version of the CE 04 also features increased wind and weather protection in the form of a large windshield with integrated hand protectors and heated grips. It also has a laser-engraved rear wheel rim on one side, a comfort seat with seat heating, new upholstery fabric and CE 04 embroidery.\n\nIncreased wind and weather protection in the form of a large windshield with integrated hand protectors, as well as a comfort seat with seat heating, are also available as optional equipment ex works for the other model variants. The new laser-engraved rear wheel rims on one side are reserved for the Avantgarde and Exclusive variants.\n\nThe optional equipment range for the new BMW CE 04 comprises the following:\n\nThe BMW CE 04 - the electric champion for the city. Like no other, it combines the latest electromobility technologies with emotion and great riding pleasure.\n\nManufactured at the BMW Group plant in Berlin, the birthplace of BMW motorcycles, the BMW CE 04 is packed with innovative technologies, particularly in terms of its drive and control systems, for which the BMW Group has filed several patent applications. With its electric drive, forward-looking design and innovative connectivity solutions, this scooter merges transport and communication functions and promises a great riding experience.\n\nPlenty of power and ample range for supreme riding in the city and in urban areas.\n\nWith a maximum output of 31 kW (42 hp), the BMW CE 04 has a powerful motor and offers outstanding riding pleasure. For the classic “traffic light start” discipline from 0 to 50 km/h, it takes just fast 2.6 seconds. Even in the reduced output L3e-A1 vehicle class, 23 kW (31 hp) drive power is available. The maximum speed of both versions is 120 km/h – for speedy progress not just in the city but on main roads and motorway sections, too.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 has an ample battery cell capacity of 60.6 Ah (8.9 kWh), providing a range of some 130 kilometres (reduced output version: 100 km). This enables day-to-day emission-free riding in the city, in an urban setting and for smaller-scale fun tours after work or at the weekend – with complete peace of mind.\n\nInnovative electric drive with liquid-cooled electric motor.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 has a permanent magnet electric motor mounted in the frame between the battery and the rear wheel, as used in a similar form in BMW cars such as the 225xe Active Tourer. BMW Motorrad conducted extensive riding tests to develop a specific type of recuperation for each riding mode, giving the rider a high-level convenience. This means that optimum performance and riding characteristics are available in every situation on the road.\n\nShort charging times and charging technology based on the system used in cars.\n\nThe lithium-ion battery is charged using the integrated charging device either at a regular household socket, a wallbox or a public charging station. When the battery is completely flat, charging time ideally lasts 4 hours and 20 minutes. With the quick charger available as an optional extra with an output of up to 6.9 kW (2.3 kW is the standard level), charging time is reduced to just 1 hour and 40 minutes when the battery is completely flat. If the battery level is only 20 per cent and the battery is charged to 80 per cent, the charging time is reduced to just 45 minutes with the optional quick charger. Depending on the market, the standard charging cable with a charging capacity of 2.3 kW comes as standard with the BMW CE 04.\n\nA Mode 3 charging cable is required for fast charging at the wallbox at home or at a public charging station. In the same way as with BMW automobiles, BMW Charging solutions are available for the BMW CE 04, too – for maximum flexibility based on numerous customised programmes for charging at home, on the road and at work.\n\nIncreased riding stability through slip control by means of ASC (Automatic Stability Control). DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) as an ex works option.\n\nSimilar to the ASC system found on BMW motorcycles with combustion engines, this traction control system is also available on the BMW CE 04. ASC limits the engine torque depending on the rear wheel slip. DTC, which is available as an option, provides even greater riding safety. DTC enables even more efficient and safe acceleration, especially in banking position.\n\nThree riding modes \"ECO\", \"RAIN\" and \"ROAD\" for efficient, everyday use as standard. “DYNAMIC” riding mode for further enhanced riding pleasure as an ex works option.\n\nIn developing the BMW CE 04, BMW Motorrad attached particular importance to providing opportunities for the rider to make an individual choice between maximum efficiency and maximum riding fun. Accordingly, the new BMW CE 04 features the three riding modes “ECO”, “RAIN” and “ROAD” as standard. The additional “DYNAMIC” riding mode is also available as an ex works option, enabling the scooter to accelerate at an even swifter pace.\n\nDirectionally stable suspension with one-piece tubular steel main frame for smooth handling and a high level of ride comfort.\n\nThe main frame is a tubular steel construction. The front wheel is controlled by a telescopic fork with a slider tube diameter of 35 mm. Rear wheel control consists of a single-sided swing arm. At the rear, suspension and damping are performed by a directly controlled, fully covered spring strut. The BMW CE 04 is fitted with generously sized tyres, with 120/70 R15 67H at the front and 160/60 R15 56H at the rear.\n\nPowerful brake system with latest-generation ABS. ABS Pro with banking capability as an ex works option.\n\nAt the front, a twin disc brake ensures secure deceleration, supported by a single-disc system at the rear. In addition, BMW Motorrad ABS ensures a high level of active safety. ABS Pro, available as an optional extra, goes even further: By means of a banking sensor, ABS Pro also controls braking on bends, thereby offering the greatest possible safety.\n\n10.25” TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation for convenient route planning and extensive connectivity as standard.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 comes fitted as standard with a 10.25-inch TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation and connectivity. Its excellent readability, clear menu navigation and highly integrated operating concept put the BMW CE 04 at the top of the scooter segment. For the first time, the new 10.25-inch colour screen makes it possible to display a navigation map in the instrument cluster, so no additional display is needed.\n\nPowerful LED lighting units all round. Adaptive Headlight Pro and light functions as ex works options.\n\nThe lighting units on the BMW CE 04 are based on state-of-the-art LED technology. They include a headlamp for high beam and low beam at the front. In addition to a rear light featuring LED technology, there are also LED turn indicators. The indicator lamps likewise use LED technology. Even greater safety at night is offered by the adaptive turning light Headlight Pro, available as an ex works option. Here, the rider benefits from further improved illumination of the road when cornering for even safer riding at night. Special light functions such as “Welcome” and “Good Bye” are also available as ex works options.\n\nFuture-oriented design and colour scheme.\n\nThe BMW CE 04's design embodies a forward-looking form of urban two-wheel mobility and uses an innovative design language that evokes emotion for this drive technology, immediately identifying it as part of the BMW Motorrad family. The modern surface treatment is impressively presented in Lightwhite non-metallic and is complemented by matt black sections in the front and side areas, as well as the “floating” seat. There are also pioneering wheels designed to look like disc wheels (solid wheels) and a side stand integrated into the design.\n\nThe highlights of the BMW CE 04:\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:"}

'We are proud that the M2 CS has once again set a new benchmark in the compact car class with this lap time.'\n\nThe continuation of a success story.\n\nThe previous best time for a BMW M2 model was set by Weidinger in April 2023, when he completed the course in 7:38.7 minutes. Two years later, he beat this time by 13 seconds, breaking the class record of 7:30 minutes for the first time. With the newly set best time of 7:25.5 minutes, the BMW M2 CS demonstrates its outstanding performance as well as the innovative power and engineering skills of BMW M GmbH.\n\nPrevious record runs on the Nordschleife by the BMW M4 CS, the BMW M4 CSL and the BMW M3 CS, all mid-range vehicles, achieved times under 7:30 minutes. The BMW M4 CSL also holds the best lap time ever recorded for a BMW Group production car. The official, notarised time is 7:18.137 minutes.\n\nThe \"Green Hell\" myth: The Nordschleife as a touchstone.\n\nOften referred to as the 'Green Hell', the Nordschleife racetrack is considered one of the most demanding and challenging racetracks in the world. Measuring 20.832 kilometres in length with over 70 bends, it places the highest demands on drivers and vehicles alike. A fast lap on this track proves a vehicle's performance and handling capabilities. The Nordschleife lap times are the gold standard for measuring a vehicle's sporting performance and driving dynamics. Record runs are monitored by a neutral testing organisation, and the vehicles are checked to ensure they are in standard condition. This detailed inspection ensures that the record runs are carried out using production vehicles.\n\nThe Nürburgring - Home of BMW M.\n\nBMW M and the Nürburgring have been in partnership for over a quarter of a century. From the BMW M Power Grandstand and BMW M Bridge to the BMW M Driving Experience and BMW M Test Centre, not to mention test drives on the Nordschleife for M vehicles en route to series production, the partnership between BMW M and the Nürburgring has been a resounding success for over 25 years. The Nordschleife serves as a test bench for every M model. The BMW M Test Centre is equipped with cutting-edge workshop facilities that allow BMW M to put vehicles through rigorous testing on the Nordschleife track even before they reach production, as well as to develop new models.\n\nBMW M Motorsport racing cars have achieved numerous successes in various racing series, including 21 overall victories in the Nürburgring 24-hour race. The M Power showroom, which was redesigned in 2021, is another flagship of the cooperation. The Nürburgring's position as the home of BMW M has been further strengthened since then.\n\nThe new BMW M2 CS: More power, improved driving dynamics and consistent lightweight construction.\n\nThe new BMW M2 CS is a testament to BMW M GmbH's ongoing commitment to setting the standard in the compact high-performance sports car segment. Its combination of performance, lightweight construction and innovative technology makes the BMW M2 CS a vehicle that gets drivers and enthusiasts' hearts racing. The BMW M2 CS increases driving pleasure in the premium segment with its enhanced performance and outstanding agility. The advanced six-cylinder in-line engine featuring BMW M TwinPower Turbo technology delivers an impressive output of 390 kW/530 hp and a maximum torque of 650 Nm. Model-specific engine mounts, an adaptive M suspension and an M compound brake system all contribute to its sporty performance. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels via an 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. The BMW M2 CS is the lightest model of the current M2 generation thanks to targeted lightweight construction, including a large number of exterior and interior components made of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP), which reduces its weight by around 30 kg. This makes a decisive contribution to its outstanding driving dynamics. The BMW M2 CS comes with forged M light-alloy wheels as standard. Manufactured at the BMW Group plant in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, the BMW M2 CS is a limited edition model with a market launch planned for late summer 2025, priced at 115,000 euros in Germany.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption and emission figures: (Fuel consumption combined: 10.0 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO2 class G) The data on fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, power consumption and range refer to vehicles on the automotive market in Germany.

Starting this year, the BMW Group is partnering with the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education as part of its “Eagles for Education” initiative. The shared goal is to provide children and young people with skills in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, and personal development.

The partnership with the foundation established by honorary DFB captain and 2014 FIFA World Cup winner Philipp Lahm was announced yesterday at Golfclub München Eichenried, where Germany’s only DP World Tour event is taking place until Sunday.\n\n„We look forward to collaborating with Philipp Lahm and his foundation, whose commitment to equal opportunities makes an important contribution to the development of children and young people. We share the belief that sports and education form the foundation for social participation and cohesion,“ said Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Places.\n\nLahm, who founded the organisation in December 2007, commented: “I am delighted about the partnership with the BMW Group as part of 'Eagles for Education.' Together, we aim to equip children and young people with essential skills for a healthy and self-determined life – especially in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, and personal development. The support of the BMW Group helps us to further develop projects like the Philipp Lahm Summer Camp and create opportunities for young people.”\n\nUnder the banner of “Eagles for Education”, BMW Group supports educational initiatives at golf events around the world. The company leverages numerous global BMW tournaments to fulfil its role as a responsible corporate citizen and to contribute to solutions for social challenges. At the BMW Golf Cup World Final, BMW Group partners with UNICEF, at the BMW PGA Championship (UK), with the Golf Foundation, at the BMW Championship (USA), with the Evans Scholars Foundation, and now at the BMW International Open (Munich), with the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education."}

Excitement was palpable today at Golfclub München Eichenried ahead of the tournament rounds of the 36thBMW International Open (July 2–6, 2025) – among amateurs, who got to play a memorable round with a pro in the Pro-Am tournament, among professionals set to compete for one of the most coveted titles on the DP World Tour starting tomorrow, and among fans, who witnessed a host of celebrities on the course.\n\nThe only German winner in the tournament’s history, Martin Kaymer, teed off alongside “Golden Goal” hero Oliver Bierhoff, former national player Tim Borowski, and coach Ralph Hassenhüttl (AUT). A “golden trio” was formed by six-time Olympic luge champions Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt (doubles), together with Michael Greis, three-time Olympic biathlon champion. Ice hockey was also well represented by NHL stars Moritz Seider and Tim Stützle, as well as national team player Maximilian Kastner. Former world-class tennis player and record winner of the BMW Open in Munich, Philipp Kohlschreiber, also proved his skills with a golf club.\n\nFrom the film industry, actors Kai Wiesinger and Kostja Ullmann, as well as director, screenwriter, and producer Florian Gallenberger, joined the event. A native of Munich, Gallenberger won an Oscar in 2001 in the Best Live Action Short Film category. Celebrity photographer Paul Ripke also showed his talents on the championship course.\n\nThe first round of the BMW International Open starts on Thursday at 7:30 a.m., with three-player groups teeing off from Tee 1 and Tee 10.\n\nQuotes from Wednesday.\n\nMartin Kaymer (GER): \"The people you work with make all the difference. You can really feel how much passion and attention to detail everyone at BMW puts in. That makes it very pleasant for us players. It's a luxury on the DP World Tour to be able to play here.

It’s a joy to come here every time.”\n\nMarcel Siem (GER): \"I don’t usually say this before a tournament, but I finally want to win here. That’s always my goal when I come. I’ve been coming here since I was a kid and even became club champion. No one knows the course better than I do. I want to win and put on a great show.”\n\nEwen Ferguson (SCO): \"I’ve always loved coming to this tournament. Munich is such a beautiful city. It’s always a pleasure to be here. The course, the event, the infrastructure, the player’s lounge, the food—everything is fantastic. Coming back as the defending champion and seeing my face around the venue is a great feeling.”\n\nTobias Arlt (GER): \"It’s just awesome to be part of the BMW International Open. It’s incredibly beautiful to play in this weather. Enjoying the Pro-Am with the pros and learning from them is amazing.”\n\nTobias Wendl (GER): \"It’s so impressive to see what the professionals can do, but it’s also great to see the people. We’re usually alone on the golf course. That’s why it’s great to see how many people are passionate about the sport.”\n\nMichael Greis (GER): \"The pros are just insane. It really shows how far away we amateurs are. But it’s incredibly fun. An absolute blast.”\n\nLuke Donald (ENG): \"It’s great to be around the players and to interact with them as much as possible. That’s a very important and meaningful part of my job - to talk to them and see how they play. Playing the course yourself gives you a better understanding. And when someone posts a strong score, you’ve seen it firsthand. I enjoy a healthy mix of watching tournaments on TV and playing a few myself—especially the BMW International Open.”\n\nWe have recorded today's press conferences in full length as video files.

A day before his appearance at the Pro-Am tournament as part of the BMW International Open (July 2–6, 2025, GC München Eichenried), football legend Gareth Bale got into the swing of things in Maisach. At the BMW M Driving Experience in Maisach, the five-time Champions League winner completed a BMW Safety Driver Training course – proving that his athletic talent extends far beyond the football pitch.\n\nBehind the wheel of a BMW M4 Competition, Bale’s programme included evasive manoeuvres without braking, drifting, and, above all, plenty of driving pleasure. The 35-year-old was thrilled and stated how comfortable he feels in Munich and at the BMW International Open: “I played in Munich in football for Real Madrid quite a few times, and had some very good results, so Munich has been a great place for me. Coming back to play in the BMW International Open in the last few years has been really fun, enjoyed the course, enjoyed the city. It is always nice to be back.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the passion-filled golfer swapped the asphalt for the greens once again. Just as in the past two years, Bale teed off at the Pro-Am tournament in Eichenried – and did so in excellent company. He played alongside European Ryder Cup Captain Luke Donald (ENG) and German NHL stars Moritz Seider and Tim Stützle.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M4 Competition Coupé: fuel consumption in l/100 km: 9,9; CO2 emissions, combined in g/km: 223; CO2 class: G"}

{"title": "“Just ask Factory Genius!”: How AI helps maintain manufacturing equipment", "date": "02.07.2025", "type": "Press Release", "summary": "+++ AI maintenance assistant Factory Genius speeds up troubleshooting at BMW Group +++ Pilot project at Plant Dingolfing forms basis of company-wide solution +++ Methodology can be transferred to other areas +++", "tags": ["Technology", "Information Technology", "Corporate", "Digitalisation", "Production, Recycling", "Artificial Intelligence"], "url": "https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0451072EN/“just-ask-factory-genius-”:-how-ai-helps-maintain-manufacturing-equipment", "content": "Munich. Whenever vehicle production equipment fails at a BMW Group plant, every minute counts. The maintenance team must work quickly to identify and resolve the cause of the fault. Now, employees can ask the new digital AI assistant, “Factory Genius”, for help: It can suggest solutions for the specific system problem within seconds, reducing the time required for error diagnosis to a minimum. “AI applications have become an integral part of modern production systems and are a key element of the BMW Group’s digital transformation. Factory Genius is an example of how generative AI, in particular, can streamline operations for everyone involved and enhance economic efficiency,” says Michael Ströbel, head of Process Management and Digitalisation, Order to Delivery at the BMW Group. But how exactly does the digital assistant, recently launched in its initial development phase, support maintenance staff? Knowledge discovery tool\n\nThe tool essentially works like a search engine, quickly filtering relevant answers to specific user queries from a vast amount of data and user reports. However, this search function does not draw content and information from the internet, but from equipment manuals, quality data, internal fault reports and planning documents it was previously trained on. To keep the data management system up to date, it is regularly fed with new knowledge – for example, in the form of daily-updated shift-log data. By integrating a Large Language Model, similar to those used in chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, Factory Genius is also able to understand language: The software can search data for relevant content within the appropriate linguistic context, providing more accurate results than a conventional search engine. In addition to displaying the top matches with links to sources, the assistant can also summarise the maintenance instructions found through contextual search in just a few sentences, if preferred. The user can then ask questions in a chat. Collaborative in-house development\n\nA pilot project in the body shop at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing laid the groundwork for this in-house development. Alongside the tool developed in Dingolfing in spring 2024, other BMW Group locations, including the plants in Spartanburg, USA, and Rosslyn, South Africa, were working at the same time on similar solutions through a transparent process. All were pursuing the same goal: improving access to information when faults occur or during scheduled training and maintenance. AI experts at the company’s Munich headquarters consolidated this expertise, integrating the plants’ diverse requirements to create a company-wide “best of” application. This can now be used globally in its initial development phase through an internal platform.\n\nIn addition to search and chat functionality, Factory Genius also features a translation function, enabling it to switch languages at any time to overcome language barriers. This functionality has proven extremely useful while building the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, for example, since manuals are often not available in Hungarian. Transferable methodology\n\nThe technology behind Factory Genius has the potential to be applied to other production use cases as well. The general approach enables integration of a wide range of documents and development of assistants tailored to different user groups. Thanks to its cloud functionality, the tool will also be rapidly available worldwide."}

Von Dellingshausen, who will play the first two rounds in an all-German group alongside Martin Kaymer and Marcel Siem, said: “I’ll definitely feel nervous on the first tee when so many fans are watching but it’s such a boost, because the crowd is totally behind us. They cheer and suffer with us. I’m just incredibly excited for the week.”\n\nReflecting on his runner-up finish on the PGA TOUR, Schmid said: “I’ve knocked on the door a few times now – especially with that second place.

The BMW International Open will take place from 2nd to 6th July 2025 at Golfclub München Eichenried. Tournament organiser BMW has once again put together a magnificent sporting and event experience, both for visitors at the course and golf fans unable to make it there in person. The following document provides a compact rundown of everything you need to know about the only DP World Tour tournament in Germany.\n\nBMW has been the organiser of the BMW International Open since 1989. No other tournament on the DP World Tour has been held for so long under the same name and with the same partner. The BMW International Open was also BMW’s first involvement in professional golf. The roots of the BMW Golf Cup, which has long since established itself as the largest international tournament series for amateur golfers, stretch back as far as 1982.\n\nThis year’s traditional Hole-in-One Car, which the pros can win with an ace on the 17th hole (par 3), is the BMW M5 Touring. It combines performance with characteristic design, while the plentiful space means it also impresses with its uncompromising suitability for everyday life. As a performance sports car with more than enough space for golf equipment, the BMW M5 Touring is the perfect Hole-in-One Car.\n\nEagles for Education.\n\n“Eagles for Education” has been the slogan of the BMW Group’s educational initiative in golf since 2023. The company makes use of numerous BMW title tournaments around the world to fulfill its responsibility as a corporate citizen and participating in solutions to social challenges. As in the previous two years, the BMW Group will support a regional organization with €1,000 for every eagle scored during tournament rounds, helping to provide children with fair starting opportunities and a self-determined life.\n\nLaunch Control: Long drive event with Martin Borgmeier and friends.\n\nIt’s going to be long, loud and spectacular. Immediately after the close of play on Saturday evening (approx. 17:30), the 18th green will host another highlight: Launch Control. Germany’s long drive world champion Martin Borgmeier will take on Ryan “The Canadian Lumberjack” Gregnol (CAN), Sam Judah (USA) and “Long Way” Bobby Ray (USA) in a show match. Cassandra Meyer (USA) takes on the captivating challenge of competing against a male Tour pro.

The 2025 edition of Les Rencontres d’Arles promises to be particularly special. It features the unprecedented exhibition \"Traversée du fragment manquant\" by artist Raphaëlle Peria and curator Fanny Robin, the winning duo of the BMW ART MAKERS programme. This milestone also marks the 15th anniversary of a long-standing cultural partnership between BMW France and Les Rencontres d’Arles.\n\nLes Rencontres d’Arles 2025. \"Trees are living beings that carry our memory; they are the guardians of our secrets,\" says artist Raphaëlle Peria.\n\nThe exhibition \"Traversée du fragment manquant\" by Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin, winners of the BMW ART MAKERS 2025 programme, will premiere this summer during the 56th edition of Les Rencontres d’Arles at the Cloître Saint-Trophime.\n\n\"With ‘Traversée du fragment manquant’, Raphaëlle Peria presents a new body of work based on fresh research and new artistic processes. Revisiting childhood photographs from her first journey along the Canal du Midi, she retraces the path of the plane trees now threatened by a devastating fungus. By exploring this landscape of memory through new effects of transparency, she captures the evolution of a disappearing nature – inscribing absence and the passage of time into her images,\" says the curator Fanny Robin.\n\nRaphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin declare, \"This award recognizes our longstanding creative partnership and allows us to go further in our exploration of new materials and forms. We aim for this project to be both unique and bold, made possible thanks to the dedicated support of the BMW team. With ‘Traversée du fragment manquant’, we invite viewers to take part in a poetic journey through the heart of photographic imagery.\"\n\nThe BMW ART MAKERSprogramme brings together and supports an emerging visual artist and curator in the joint creation of an original artistic project. The winning duo receives a €33,000 grant as well as production and research funding. The resulting exhibition is first presented at Les Rencontres d’Arles and then showcased at Paris Photo, where BMW is also an official partner.\n\nPractical Information Exhibition: \"Traversée du fragment manquant\" by Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin.Location: Robin Cloître Saint-Trophime, Arles.Dates: 7 July – 5 October 2025.\n\nA celebration of diversity and long-term commitment: 15 years of partnership.\n\nAs this anniversary approaches, BMW France reflects on a long-standing collaboration. As a pioneering company, BMW values the avant-garde visions of artists, who foresee the world’s future challenges. Their unique perspectives help us anticipate social transformations and enrich our understanding of the world.\n\nFor 15 years, BMW has provided a platform for artistic experimentation through its partnership with the festival. The diversity of projects presented over the years highlights the evolution of contemporary creation and reinforces BMW's role as a committed supporter of emerging talents.\n\nFrom ten years of the BMW Residency to the last three editions of the BMW ART MAKERS programme, numerous artists and curators have explored contemporary themes through varied and innovative practices. Artists such as Alexandra Catière, Baptiste Rabichon, and Almudena Romero have combined traditional techniques with new technologies to create sensitive, imaginative, and sometimes ephemeral works. Other projects have explored intersections between disciplines – like Natasha Caruana's exploration of love and science, or the immersive installation by Arash Hanaei and Morad Montazami examining the impact of digital technologies on human subjectivity.\n\nHumour infused the examination of human-animal relationships in the work of Mazaccio & Drowilal, while Alinka Echeverria challenged traditional representations of femininity and identity. Emeric Lhuisset addressed physical and cultural borders, while Marion Gronier revealed the world of the circus through portraiture. Dune Varela questioned the permanence and two-dimensionality of photography, while Eva Nielsen and Marianne Derrien reinvented the medium through solar screen printing to evoke the layered nature of landscapes . Mustapha Azeroual and Marjolaine Levy’s use of lenticular panoptics in \"The Green Ray\" revealed what often escapes our gaze.\n\nThrough this collaboration with Les Rencontres d’Arles, BMW France contributes to the photographic heritage while nurturing the diversity of contemporary expression and encouraging critical engagement with the present. This approach fosters a shared narrative and redefines our perception of the modern world.\n\nA strong commitment to education and transmission. Beyond creativity, this partnership is also rooted in education, particularly through “La Rentrée en Images”, an initiative by Les Rencontres d’Arles. Each year, more than 400 school classes are invited to discover contemporary photography, develop critical thinking skills, and reflect on their relationship with images.\n\nA shared vision for the future of culture. BMW is committed to supporting artistic creation, research, and cultural transmission in a spirit of sustainability and social responsibility. BMW’s partnerships are part of a long-term strategy aimed at making culture accessible to all while fostering dialogue between artists, society, and the company. This anniversary highlights the strength and longevity of BMW’s relationship with Les Rencontres d’Arles and reflects a shared vision.\n\n\"The partnership with BMW fully aligns with the mission of Les Rencontres d'Arles to support emerging creation and offer a platform for exploring contemporary issues in an experimental context. The launch of the BMW ART MAKERS programme four years ago marked a significant turning point by offering a selected artist-curator duo the means to bring their exhibition project to life. Over the past 15 years of collaboration, BMW has helped foster the emergence of new talent. This year, the project ‘Traversée du fragment manquant’ by Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin – winners of the BMW ART MAKERS programme – is presented as part of the ‘Nomadic Chronicles’ section of Les Rencontres d’Arles 2025. It explores the traces left by the transformation of the landscape along the Canal du Midi. Merging photography, engraving, and memory, family archives blend with tactile gestures in a sensitive rediscovery of the territory,\" says Christoph Wiesner, Director of Les Rencontres d’Arles.\n\n\"Together, we make culture shine – today and for future generations – celebrating the value of long-term commitment in a rapidly changing world,\" says Vincent Salimon, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW Group France.\n\nBiographies of the BMW ART MAKERS 2025 Laureates.\n\nRaphaëlle Peria, Artist Graduated in 2014 from the École Européenne Supérieure d’Art de Bretagne.

The endurance marathon in June 2025 has come to an end. With the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), BMW M Motorsport has completed its third 24-hour race within three weeks. The goal at the world’s largest GT3 race, featuring 74 starters, was to secure another podium finish following the outstanding triumph at the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER) just a week ago. Despite a hard-fought effort, this goal was not achieved. The ROWE Racing and WRT teams finished the race with three cars in the top 10, securing fifth, seventh, and eighth places. A late penalty dropped the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from ROWE Racing from third to fifth position. Video statements on the past 24-hour races from Andreas Roos and Hans-Peter Naundorf are available for editorial use: \n\nThe Nürburgring-winning trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) briefly took the lead at Spa-Francorchamps thanks to some luck during a yellow flag phase. They engaged in a long-distance battle with the eventual winners. In the final stages, Marciello fought hard against a Ferrari for third place, but his efforts led to one too many track limit violations. As a result, he received a 30-second penalty after the race, dropping the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from third to fifth place. The #998 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from ROWE Racing, featuring the \"GEN M\" livery and driven by Philipp Eng (AUT), Dan Harper (GBR), and Max Hesse (GER), was also on course for a podium finish for much of the race. However, they were unlucky during a yellow flag phase, which caused them to lose ground. Shortly before the end, Eng had to retire the car to the garage due to suspension damage, leaving them classified in 29th place.\n\nTeam WRT faced a challenging home race. The #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO crew of Ugo de Wilde, Charles Weerts (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), maximised their potential and secured valuable points with a seventh-place finish. Right behind them, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) finished in eighth after a hard-fought race. Technical issues and damage to the car, which required repairs, cost the #31 crew a lap that they were unable to recover despite strong pace. In the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Kevin Magnussen (DEN) made his GT3 racing debut for BMW M Motorsport alongside Valentino Rossi (ITA) and René Rast (GER). The high-profile trio delivered a solid performance and finished in 11th place.\n\nCentury Motorsport had reason to celebrate as the #42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, driven by Jarrod Waberski (RSA), Will Moore (GBR), and Mex Jansen (NED), secured a third-place finish in the Silver class. In total, eleven BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars competed at Spa-Francorchamps.\n\nGT4 European Series: Victory for BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler.\n\nAs part of the 24-hour race weekend, the GT4 European Series held two races. In Saturday's second race, Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport triumphed with the #12 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler (TUR) and Gabriele Piana (ITA) shared driving duties, claiming their first win and podium of the season. In the first race at Spa-Francorchamps, Besler and Piana finished fourth. They currently sit third in the drivers' standings. Other BMW M Motorsport teams also celebrated podium finishes in Belgium. Schubert Motorsport secured second place in the Pro-Am class during the first race with the #98 BMW M4 GT4 EVO, driven by Victor Bouveng and Joakim Walde (both SWE). In the Am category, the Schubert Motorsport duo Stefan Nilsson and Mats Olsson (both SWE) finished third in the #97 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. In Saturday's race, second place in the Am class went to the #317 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from CHAZEL Technologie Course, driven by Antoni De Barn and Jean-Mathieu Leandri (both FRA).\n\nComments after the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “This was the last of the three 24-hour races in June, and unfortunately, we were unable to follow up on the fantastic victory at the Nürburgring here in Spa-Francorchamps. It was evident that we lacked the pace over the race distance to compete at the very front. We tried everything to get the most out of our package. Many thanks to all the teams, drivers, and BMW M Motorsport colleagues for their efforts. It’s a shame that, in the end, ROWE Racing missed out on the podium due to the track limits penalty. But unfortunately, this can happen when you have to race at the limit for the entire event. We’ll be back next year and aim to fight for victory again, as we did in 2023. Congratulations to Century Motorsport for their podium in the Silver class, to Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport for their win with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO, and to the Lamborghini winners!.”\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): “The past two weeks have been incredibly intense and emotional. We celebrated a major success at the Nürburgring and continued at this high level here in Spa-Francorchamps. For twelve hours, we were in the top three, proudly flying the flag for BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing. In the end, it wasn’t quite enough for another podium. Our performance in the final stages wasn’t as strong as it needed to be compared to the competition. That’s part of motorsport, and you have to accept it. Congratulations to the winners, who also did a great job. The race was very tough, but all the drivers and team members worked brilliantly despite the high demands. A huge thank you and big compliments for that! This was the hardest thing we’ve ever done as a team.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal WRT): “That was a disappointing race for us. I think we BMW M Motorsport teams made the best of the resources available to us. Fifth, seventh, and eighth places reflect the balance of power quite well from my perspective. It’s a shame that we couldn’t fight for victory at our home race this time.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 5th place): “It has been a bitter end for us. We gave it all. It was difficult to keep the car on track, so I feel sorry for Lello. I think a podium was in our reach, but no more. We executed the race very well, apart from this very little mistake with the track limits. The team did perfect pit stops, the strategy and everything were also perfect. It was so close but then so far away. But I think we have enough reasons to smile, and I have enough reasons to smile for the opportunity BMW M Motorsport gave to me to compete in the three biggest 24-hour races in the world with a competitive car. This is what I take from it, including the victory at the Nürburgring just one week ago.”\n\nUgo de Wilde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 7th place): “I think that everyone will be disappointed with the result because it was not what we aimed for. But I think we can be proud of the entire team. Everyone did the best he could, the team members, the hospitality staff, the mechanics, strategists, engineers, team managers, drivers. We all pushed for it. This time, we did not have the tools to win the race but we did the most with what we had. And for getting the result there is always also a parameter which is called luck. Sometimes you need to be in the right place at the right time and that wasn’t the case in this race. But I am very proud of my team and my team-mates. Everyone did an amazing job and will try to learn from the things that we can improve, we will analyse the details and try to come back stronger. We still have a championship to fight for and we took important points for that. So we focus on the positives.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 8th place): “Eighth place is not the result we came here for. Unfortunately, we had too many issues during the race that set us back. The torn-off diffuser, which we had to repair, cost us a lap. We tried everything to make up that lap, but we simply lacked the necessary luck in this race. It’s frustrating to try for so many hours and still not succeed in the end. I think we had the speed to achieve a top-5 result. Anything more would have been difficult anyway.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 11th place): “All in all, it was a good experience to compete in this race and to drive the BMW M 4 GT3 EVO. It didn’t go the way we hoped but we had a clean race. We didn’t have any issues, we didn’t get any penalties, we didn’t have any damage. So we did the best we could and I think we were close to finish in the top ten. It’s obviously not the best result we could wish for but it was a nice experience and I am thankful for the opportunity. It was great to share the car with Valentino and René, that was a real privilege. Now I am looking forward to more.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 11th place): “It’s emotional to finish such a race because it involves a lot of effort. The last ten hours were very long. I find it more demanding than Le Mans because the track is physically more challenging. I was tired at the end, but I drove well in my last two stints. The goal was to finish in the top 10. Unfortunately, we never had the necessary pace for more, we were never fast enough. In the end, we drove a good race, and I got along very well with Kevin and René. I enjoyed it. I also learned a lot, which will make me even stronger next time.”\n\nDan Harper (#998 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 29th place): “It has been a rollercoaster. The guys prepared the car brilliantly as always. The car was very fast as we have seen in the race. Unfortunately at the end, after leading for a period and always fighting in the top three, a FCY came at the wrong time for us which dropped us back. From that point we never got the luck back in our favour. It was shame. In the end I think we didn’t have the pace to compete against the Lamborghini. Congratulations to them, they have always been fast here and never had a result. It was also a shame for the #98 to miss out the podium in the end. But I think that ROWE Racing can still be proud, with two cars fighting for the podium the whole way to the finish after a fantastic victory at the Nürburgring last week. They always perform and it is just a shame for them and BMW M Motorsport to miss out on the podium.”"}

It’s a moment the entire MotoGP™ family eagerly anticipates each year: the unveiling of the winner’s car for the BMW M Award. That moment arrived at the Grand Prix of the Netherlands at Assen. Representing all MotoGP™ riders, Brad Binder and Alex Rins revealed the prize that awaits the fastest qualifier of the season: the new BMW M2 CS (fuel consumption combined: 10.0 l/100 km; CO₂ emissions combined: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G)* in Velvet Blue Metallic.\n\nThe BMW M Award has been a cornerstone of BMW M’s activities as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’ and has been presented annually since 2003. In every MotoGP™ qualifying session, points are awarded based on position – mirroring the race points system. The rider with the most points at the end of the season’s final qualifying session wins the coveted prize: an exclusive high-performance BMW M automobile.\n\nThe 2025 winner’s car, the BMW M2 CS, was introduced to the world at the end of May. It raises the bar for pure driving pleasure in the premium compact high-performance sports car segment. This latest exclusive special edition from BMW M GmbH thrills with outstanding agility, significantly increased power, exceptional driving dynamics, and distinctly sporty design features. The inline six-cylinder engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and high-revving characteristics in the BMW M2 CS delivers an impressive 390 kW (530 hp). Power is transmitted to the rear wheels via the standard 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. The BMW M2 CS accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds.\n\nBMW M GmbH has reduced the special model’s weight by around 30 kilogrammes compared to the base model, thanks to targeted lightweight construction using numerous exterior and interior components made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP). It comes equipped with forged M light-alloy wheels as standard. This makes the BMW M2 CS the lightest BMW M2 of the current generation.\n\nBinder and Rins had the opportunity to get a closer look at the new winner’s car during a special competition at Assen. This time, it wasn’t only about outright speed on the racetrack – it was all about skill, handling, and, of course, speed. In a Drive in Reverse Challenge, the two MotoGP™ aces had to complete a marked course in reverse gear as quickly as possible. Touching one of the marker cones incurred a two-second time penalty. Meanwhile, the other rider took on the role of commentator and gave live play-by-play of the “race.” The winner was Binder.\n\nThe BMW M2 CS in Velvet Blue Metallic will be handed over to the 2025 BMW M Award winner at the season finale in mid-November at Valencia, Spain. Record winner Marc Márquez claimed the award seven times in a row from 2013 to 2019. In the past three years, Francesco Bagnaia has secured the coveted prize. The list of winners also includes Valentino Rossi, Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo, Fabio Quartararo, Sete Gibernau, and Nicky Hayden.\n\nFor more information on BMW M GmbH, its partnership with MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports since 1999, and the involvement as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’ see: \n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M2 CS: fuel consumption combined: 10.0 l/100 km; CO₂ emissions combined: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G"}

The production facilities are moving into the largely completed new BMW Group assembly plant for high-voltage batteries. A major milestone just over a year after construction began in April 2024. The BMW Group is relying on expertise from Germany: All construction companies and more than three quarters of plant manufacturers come from Germany and in particular from Bavaria. During a visit, Bavarian Prime Minister Dr. Markus Söder, together with the board members of BMW AG Ilka Horstmeier and Milan Nedeljković, saw for himself the progress of the innovation project in the Straubing-Bogen district. Markus Söder: \"Bavaria is a car country! BMW is building a giga-factory for high-tech batteries in Irlbach and Straßkirchen in Lower Bavaria. This is where the electromobility of the future is being created. The entire rural region will benefit from this. High technology and the future fit perfectly with Bavaria: the automobile is our most important industry, and BMW is a global brand ambassador for the Free State. When BMW thrives, Bavaria thrives. We believe in the automobile and our companies.\"\n\nIn future, high-voltage batteries for the Neue Klasse will be manufactured at the BMW Group Plant Irlbach-Strasskirchen. Dr. Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board Management of BMW AG, Production, explained: “The Neue Klasse is full of innovations, and this is also reflected in manufacturing technologies. In future, German vehicle plants will be supplied with sixth-generation high-voltage batteries from this location.” The BMW Group has made a conscious decision to invest in Bavaria. Nedeljković continues: “This work proves that high-tech has a future in Germany.” A prerequisite for technological progress is close cooperation between research, industry and politics.\n\nIlka Horstmeier, member of the Board Management of BMW AG responsible for People and Real Estate, Labour Relations Director: “Our new Plant Irlbach-Strasskirchen is an example of how successful industrial settlements are possible in Germany. A prove-point is our successful collaboration with our partners. This was possible in close cooperation with the Bavarian state government, committed local politicians, local authorities and local people. And this in “Bavarian Speed” — faster than any other construction project in Germany in recent years. With this new plant, we are securing thousands of jobs in Bavaria in times of rapidly growing electric mobility and are shaping the future of individual mobility.”\n\nState-of-the-art technology from Germany\n\nIn the coming months, BMW Group employees will assemble and set up the production facilities together with partner companies. More than three quarters of production system installers come from Germany, and every third company out of over 30 partners comes from Bavaria. The BMW Group is thus relying on German state-of-the-art technology when selecting its installers and is also following the local for local approach in the area of production technology.\n\nThe first high-voltage batteries are to be produced for testing purposes by the end of this year. Series production at the new location is planned to start at the end of 2026.\n\nLocal expertise in construction and commissioning\n\nConstruction of the high-voltage battery assembly plant is going according to plan. The BMW Group relies on local expertise: All directly contracted construction companies come from Germany, two thirds from Bavaria and every third contracted company comes from within 100 kilometers of the new plant. At the same time, the BMW Group is thus providing an important impetus to the domestic economy.\n\nAt the end of June 2024, the first of 1,066 pillars was installed in the central production building. Twelve months later, technical building equipment has progressed so far that the installation of production systems is now being started.\n\nQualification campaign secures jobs in transformation\n\n1,600 jobs will be created at the new plant. Through internal selection and application processes, the BMW Group is currently recruiting interested parties to operate the Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen. Many future employees have experience in battery manufacturing. At the competence center for e-mobility in Dingolfing, just 40 kilometers away, they now produce the fifth generation of high-voltage batteries. But employees from other production areas are also applying internally for the new location.\n\nNumerous programs have been launched to retrain and further qualify employees. The teams are characterized by a willingness to learn and change. In addition, in September 2025, for the second year in a row, 50 young people will start their apprenticeship in Dingolfing and Regensburg, who will work at the Irlbach-Strasskirchen location in the future.\n\nThe demanding, promising jobs at the new — for many nearby — location add value to the rural region and provide a powerful economic impetus.\n\nFurther information about the new location in Irlbach and Strasskirchen can be found on the project website — at The next opening date for the information container on the construction site is on June 28 from 3 pm to 5 pm."}

Tomorrow, the new fine-dining restaurant at BMW Welt will welcome its first customers. Since the start of the year, head chef Jens Madsen – who follows in the footsteps of Bobby Bräuer in the exclusive surroundings of BMW Welt – has been working together with BMW Group Designworks, the BMW Group's innovation studio, on a unique new concept: THE CLOUD by Käfer. Here, Madsen, restaurant manager Mona Röthig, sommelier Luigi Pecchia and their team will introduce guests to the “CULINARY NOMADISM” vision successfully trialled at a pop-up event in April.\n\nThe restaurant’s opening season will explore the theme “NOMADIC EARTH”, as Madsen escorts his guests on a culinary voyage.\n\n“With Nomadic Earth, we are writing the first chapter in our new travelogue. We want to offer our guests a special experience of elite-level cuisine that expands their horizons and blends aromas and textures from around the world with the finest produce from our local region – with surprising yet cohesive results. In Jens Madsen, Mona Röthig and Luigi Pecchia, we have assembled a team who are turning this ambitious vision into masterful reality with exceptional skill and passion,” explains Michael Käfer.\n\n“To bring Käfer’s vision to life, Designworks developed the spatial concept and storytelling for THE CLOUD. Materials, forms, and details come together to create an atmosphere that is sensual, full of contrast, and emotionally engaging. In this way, the design becomes an integral part of the overall culinary experience,” says Anders Warming, Head of BMW Group Designworks.\n\n“With THE CLOUD by Käfer, we are adding a new dimension to the BMW Welt experience. In addition to vehicle handovers, we can now also offer our guests an inspirational culinary journey in a unique setting created by BMW Group Designworks Munich. Here, in the upper reaches of BMW Welt on its third level, guests enjoy an impressive view over the inside of the building, while immersed in a fine-dining experience,” adds Sandra Wittemer, Head of BMW Welt.\n\nThe experts at BMW Group Designworks and Käfer have worked together closely since 2023 to create a space for all the senses and make a visit to THE CLOUD by Käfer truly unforgettable. Light, music, visual and haptic features flow into one another; every light and every piece of furniture contributes to the experience as a whole. For the execution of the project, BMW Group Designworks collaborated with renowned partners including architectural and design studio hildmannwilke, German lighting design brand Occhio, the artist Oscar Zabala – known for his generative audio-visual performances and installations – and innovative Swiss fabric manufacturer Jakob Schlaepfer, supplier to haute couture fashion houses around the world.\n\nThe eight-course menu with complementary side dishes brings regional produce – such as goat’s milk from Lenggries, char from Kinsau and venison from the Poltinger Forest – together with dukkah, black pepper soup and pearl emmer pilaf. And the milk-fed veal brochette is inspired by snacks typically served with a beer in African bars. Jens Madsen takes prime cut of veal, skewered on a spike, and serves it with tiger nut, chapati and habanero pepper.\n\nThe philosophy behind Madsen’s cuisine is very much his own and is rooted in movement, memory and origin. This new concept new brings together culinary traditions, skills and spices from around the world with top-quality local produce to create highly distinctive cuisine. In Season 1 at THE CLOUD by Käfer, this features aromas and ingredients from eastern and southern Africa, combined with the delicacies and rhythm of Bavaria. Each course reflects a particular stop on a culinary journey, in some cases inspired by faraway shores, at other times recalling pastures closer to home. It all goes into making cuisine that exudes a curiosity for global influences yet embraces its local roots, appealing to the senses, sparking wonder and surprise, and staying open to new perspectives.\n\nElegant and inviting, with a technically refined aesthetic, the restaurant displays clear references to the design language of BMW. After ascending to the third level of the “floating” structure conceived by COOP Himmelb(l)au, the guests embark on their journey after leaving the elevator. Arriving on Moon Island, they can take a moment to tune into the feel of the evening. They are greeted in understated style by a digital artwork featuring a quarter moon, which gradually morphs from the golden hour through soft twilight to the deep blue tones of the night.\n\nAt the Biophilic Bar, made from Perlino marble, artistically presented ingredients from the menu arouse the guests’ curiosity about the dining to come as they enjoy an aperitif. They then move on to the Slim Bar, where a personalised cocktail will be served – and where they can also round off their journey later on with a concluding drink. Here, the golden hour transitions into the blue hour. The guests then move on through the Chef’s Atelier, decorated with travel photos and exotic examples of kitchenware, until they finally reach the Dining Cloud, taking their seats at tables with panoramic views over BMW Welt. Floating over the centre of this space is the amorphous cloud-like installation from which it takes its name. Made from a transparent, featherweight fabric material, and brought to weightless, constantly changing life by a projection, it reprises both the golden colour of sunset and the deep blue of midnight.\n\nBetween the kitchen and the Dining Cloud stands a five-ton monolith made of titanium stone. On this impressive stage, the kitchen team put the finishing touches to the plates, before the servers take them to their recipients. The guests are given another hint of what is happening in the kitchen by a one-way mirror with 15 per cent transparency, which provides glimpses without revealing the whole picture.\n\nLisa Meindl, Spokesperson BMW Museum and BMW Welt\n\nSimone Bauer, Communications BMW Welt\n\nInternet: \n\nAbout BMW Group Designworks\n\nDesignworks is the BMW Group's innovation studio and a global creative consultancy at the intersection of design, technology and innovation.

Golf legends such as Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson (both USA), Viktor Hovland (NOR), and Matt Fitzpatrick (ENG) also launched impressive careers with that title. This year, the 21-year-old has already competed at the Masters and the U.S. Open and is now looking forward to his first appearance on the DP World Tour.\n\nAnticipation for the BMW International Open is also high for Tim Wiedemeyer (GC St. Leon-Rot) and Wolfgang Glawe (GC Hubbelrath), who secured the two spots reserved for German amateurs.

On the same day that the BMW M4 GT3 EVO claimed victory at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER), the car also celebrated its first win in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. BMW M works drivers Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) triumphed in the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paul Miller Racing in the GTD PRO class at the Six Hours of the Glen. For the duo, it was their first victory in North America. Meanwhile, BMW M Team RLL faced a challenging race with the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Watkins Glen (USA).\n\nFrom the start of the race weekend, it was clear that the BMW M Hybrid V8 would struggle compared to some competitors. The pace conditions were not ideal. Additionally, neither car crew drove a flawless race from starting positions six and seven. The #25 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER), retired after an accident involving Wittmann. The #24 car, piloted by Philipp Eng (AUT) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), managed to stay with the leading group in a race with numerous yellow flags but could not finish higher than eighth in a strategic poker at the end.\n\nIn contrast, there was immense celebration for Harper, Hesse, and Paul Miller Racing. The team and drivers started from second in their class and made a remarkable comeback after an early setback. Harper incurred a 60-second stop-and-go penalty for crossing the red pit-exit light after a pit stop, dropping the duo to last place. However, numerous yellow flags and a perfect strategy returned the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO to the front. Paul Miller Racing was even on course for a one-two finish, but a late-race technical penalty for low tyre pressure dropped the #1 car, driven by Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, and Connor De Phillippi (all USA), from second to eighth. In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport's #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, driven by Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, and Jake Walker (all USA), was also on course for a podium finish but fell to eighth due to incidents in the final stage of the race.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"This was a race with mixed emotions for us at BMW M Motorsport. I am absolutely thrilled about the first victory of our BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the IMSA series! Paul Miller Racing has shown strong performances throughout the season and was often close to victory. Now it finally happened! Congratulations to Dan Harper and Max Hesse on their first win in North America! It’s unfortunate that the sister car and the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Turner Motorsport couldn’t make it to the podium despite also having strong races. Overall, our GT3 programme in the U.S. is in excellent shape. Our BMW M Hybrid V8 had to fight with blunt weapons at Watkins Glen. BMW M Team RLL and our drivers gave it their all, but unfortunately, we didn’t have the flawless race we needed to make the most of the circumstances. Now we are determined to return to our former strength at the next GTP class race in Road America.\"\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 8th place): \"Unfortunately, it was a frustrating race. From the start of the weekend, we knew we were going into the race with difficult conditions compared to some competitors. We simply didn’t have the necessary pace. On top of that, we didn’t have a perfect race. Especially in the final stint, there might have been some opportunities through strategy, but we didn’t make the optimal decisions.\"\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"We kept a cool head in a hot race. Unfortunately, I made a mistake at the pit exit early on, which earned us the penalty. I’m very glad we were able to make up for it during the race. Max did the hard work in the middle of the race to bring us back to the front. The team had a perfect strategy and fantastic pit stops. I asked the team to let me drive the final stint to make up for my earlier mistake. Luckily, we managed to do that together, and we were able to celebrate our first win of the season. We’ve had good pace in almost every race so far, and now we’ve finally been rewarded with the right result. Hopefully, this is the start of a strong second half of the season.\"\n\nMax Hesse (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"It was an incredibly good weekend for us at Watkins Glen. The team told us beforehand that they’ve often been strong here in the past, so we were really looking forward to it, but the race was anything but easy. With second place in qualifying by Dan and a good start, things initially went great, but then the rain came, and we got the 60-second penalty, which dropped us to last place. We were frustrated because we thought we had thrown away a top result but there were many yellow flags, and our car was very strong on restarts. I gradually worked my way back to first place, and Dan did an amazing job in the final stint. I’m very proud and happy for the team. Unfortunately, the #1 car had the penalty at the end. The team deserved a one-two finish. After five races, we are now third in the championship and have two podiums. Things are going well for us here in North America.\""}

Victory for BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER)! In front of a record crowd in the \"Green Hell\", Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) crowned an outstanding comeback with BMW's 21st overall victory at the endurance classic on the Nordschleife. Additionally, the new BMW M2 Racing impressed as in its final endurance test, the new entry-level race car – fielded by Team FK Performance Motorsport – celebrated a class victory.\n\nROWE Racing had a challenging start to the weekend in the Eifel region. After the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO missed out on the top qualifying session, the BMW M works driver quartet started the race from 17th position. However, under perfect weather conditions, Farfus made a dream start, moving into the top ten within the first lap. After an hour and a half, a power outage in the paddock caused a red flag. Following a 2-hour and 15-minute interruption, van der Linde stormed through the field during the restart, advancing the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from ninth to third in just two laps.\n\nSubsequently, Marciello and Krohn solidified their positions in the podium ranks, with ROWE Racing navigating the night flawlessly and steadily in second place, building a comfortable gap to the cars behind. As the sun rose over the Nordschleife, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO closed a gap of over two minutes to the leader. By the morning, the race turned into a true thriller in the \"Green Hell\". Three and a half hours before the finish, Farfus claimed the lead for ROWE Racing for the first time.\n\nAfter a penalty was issued to the competing #911 Porsche, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO was firmly on course for victory, which van der Linde secured after 24 hours. Although he crossed the finish line behind the Porsche, the Manthey EMA team's appeal against the penalty was dismissed, ensuring ROWE Racing's victory. For van der Linde, this marked his third triumph at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring after wins in 2017 and 2022 – his first with BMW M Motorsport. Alongside Farfus and his brother Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), the 29-year-old had also won the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge at Bathurst, Australia. That series includes the 24h Nürburgring as well as the upcoming 24h Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) next weekend.\n\nFor Farfus, it was his second victory on the Nordschleife after a 15-year wait, while Marciello celebrated his first 24h-race win for BMW M Motorsport in front of a record crowd of 280,000 spectators. For Krohn, it was also his first victory at the 24h Nürburgring. BMW, the record champions at the Nürburgring, last triumphed five years ago. In 2020, the BMW M6 GT3, also fielded by ROWE Racing, claimed victory.\n\nImpressive class victory for the BMW M2 Racing. The new BMW M2 Racing also delivered an outstanding performance. BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER), Charles Weerts, and Ugo de Wilde (BEL), along with motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER), were unbeatable in the SP 3T class with the #310 car. It marked a perfect final endurance test before the sales phase begins for the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car.\n\nIn total, BMW M Motorsport customer teams achieved seven class victories at the 24h Nürburgring. The #67 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from AV Racing by Black Falcon triumphed in the SP10 class. Additional successes included the #650 BMW M240i Racing from Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels in the BMW M240i class, the #500 BMW 330i from the same team in the VT2 rear-wheel-drive class, the #700 BMW 325i from rent2Drive-racing in its respective class, and the #277 BMW 318ti from RAVENOL Motorsport by MDM Racing in the SP3 class.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"I am absolutely thrilled for ROWE Racing and the drivers on this 21st overall victory for BMW at the 24h Nürburgring. This time, we could only compete with one car in the top class, but as we’ve seen, when the team and drivers deliver a perfect performance, the 'Green Hell' can be forgiving. In recent years, it hasn’t always been on our side, but this time, after 2020, we finally managed to secure another victory. Congratulations to everyone involved! The race of our new BMW M2 Racing was also sensational, achieving an impressive class victory right out of the gate. What an outstanding performance by the team and drivers!\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"What an incredible 24-hour race! Although we only competed with one car, we had a fantastic team and amazing drivers. ROWE Racing, along with Augusto Farfus, Jesse Krohn, Raffaele Marciello, and Kelvin van der Linde, delivered an absolutely flawless and perfect performance. Congratulations and a big thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport who worked so hard for this success. The performance of our new family member, the BMW M2 Racing, was also inspiring, with Ugo de Wilde, Jens Klingmann, Charles Weerts, and Michael Bräutigam celebrating a class victory. Congratulations to the FK Performance Motorsport team and to all teams and drivers who celebrated class wins and podiums in their BMW vehicles today! I am very proud!\"\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal, ROWE Racing): \"I am incredibly happy and proud of my team and drivers. I still can’t quite believe it. The race was exciting on so many levels. If someone had told me on Thursday that we’d be standing here as winners on Sunday, I wouldn’t have believed them. At that point, we were dealing with completely different problems. To work through those and hold our ground in such a tough and hot race was a fantastic achievement by everyone. This success is good for everyone and hopefully a good omen for the race at Spa-Francorchamps next week.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I had the privilege of driving the formation lap and seeing all these fans. This place is magical. We are blessed to be part of this show and to race in front of these people. I celebrated my first major victory for BMW M Motorsport here 15 years ago, and to stand here again is something special – and with the only BMW M4 GT3 EVO. We came here with just one car, but in the end, we represented BMW in the best possible way. Our goal was to finish the race, and in the end, we did so as winners. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing for the trust. Bringing this trophy home is also a big reward for the people in Munich.\"\n\nJesse Krohn (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am just grateful: grateful to BMW M Motorsport, ROWE Racing, my teammates, and the fans. This is such a special day. I’ve been coming here for over ten years, and finally, everything came together. There are moments when you feel like it will never happen, but now we’ve done it. You just need the right people around you, and we had that today. I’m just thankful to be here and to experience this moment.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am very happy. The 24 Hours of Nürburgring is one of the races I’ve always wanted to win. I’m glad that this dream has finally come true. Among the three 24-hour races this June, this was my main goal. Achieving this victory makes me incredibly proud. My teammates did a fantastic job. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing.\"\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"It’s always a privilege. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing for the trust. It was an extreme race. The entire team worked flawlessly. Everyone was at their limit: the car, us, and the tyres at the end. It was one of the toughest 24-hour races I’ve experienced here, and I am very, very proud.\"\n\nUgo de Wilde (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"It was a fantastic weekend for me: my first 24 hours on the Nordschleife. The main goal was to gain experience and show that the car is reliable. We achieved that. The car was very good, very reliable, very consistent, and it was fun to drive. It was a fantastic experience to drive at night and to spend these days with the great team and my amazing teammates. We had a great atmosphere, and it was a joy to work with them. Huge congratulations to BMW M Motorsport, ROWE Racing, and all the drivers – especially my GT World Challenge teammate Kelvin – on the overall victory.\"\n\nJens Klingmann (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"We are super happy. We completed the 24h Nürburgring, the dress rehearsal, the ultimate endurance test, without any issues. That makes us very proud and confident that we can deliver a proven race car that also has strong performance. With P36 in the overall standings and the class victory, we’ve clearly demonstrated that. We are incredibly happy; the car ran flawlessly and looks the same after the final lap as it did after the first. And of course, we are very happy about the overall victory for BMW M Motorsport and that the trophy is heading back to Munich.\"\n\nCharles Weerts (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"It was a very good race for both the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M2 Racing. The car performed very well. Our primary goal was to finish the race – and then to be as successful as possible. And we achieved that. Michael, Ugo, Jens, and the entire team did a fantastic job. It’s great to see that the project worked so well. If the car survives the 24 hours at the Nürburgring, it’s a very successful test for the car. I’m very happy for BMW M Motorsport, and of course, congratulations to ROWE Racing on the overall victory with the #98.\"\n\nMichael Bräutigam (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"My weekend was filled with many emotions. First and foremost, I was incredibly proud to even be part of this project and to drive and get to know a car that no one outside the BMW family had seen before. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport for that! Since I’m from the Eifel, this race – especially in front of a record crowd – is an absolute highlight for me. I’m very happy with the result and my performance.\""}

With full focus, the driver team continued the race through the shortest night of the year - and made up over 60 places in the overall standings over the course of the race.\n\nAs in the previous year, Markus Fischer drove the team's fastest lap. With a strong lap time of 10:02, he was even able to beat last year's fastest lap. It was the first 24 hours of Nürburgring for Samantha Tan and Toby Goodman - and a successful premiere with second place in the SP3T class.\n\nIt was not only with sensational lap times and impressive endurance that the MINI 24-hour race car earned the respect of competitors and spectators at the Nürburgring: thanks to its exterior skin designed exclusively with the fashion and lifestyle brand Deus Ex Machina, the MINI John Cooper Works was a highlight of the race weekend even before the start.\n\n280,000 fans cheered on the teams at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring - a new record. This makes the race one of the most popular motorsport events in the world again this year.

Munich. A new central control unit called the Heart of Joy is taking BMW driving dynamics to a new level – from standstill to the limits. It will make its debut in the BMW Neue Klasse models. The Heart of Joy combines with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack to centrally control the powertrain, brakes and recuperation as well as some steering functions. Compared to previous systems, the new control unit processes driving information around ten times faster and responds more directly to the driver than ever before. The Heart of Joy passed its first public performance test at Auto Shanghai, as part of the BMW Vision Driving Experience.\n\nThe “Meet Okto the Octopus” video translates the new “superbrain’s” power into cinematic poetry. The star of the video is an octopus. A fascinating animal that uses a decentralised nervous system to enable independent control of individual parts of its body.

In the new BMW brand video, this scenario is reversed: the octopus is given a central nervous system and then moves in a synchronised, precise and controlled manner to perform an underwater waltz – while simultaneously avoiding hazards.\n\nThe video’s concept and implementation are the work of the Jung von Matt Hamburg agency.

Club sports and tennis are effective platforms for young people - not only for physical activity but also for personal development and as a gateway to social connections and networks. The goal of FUTURE ACES is to open the door to these valuable future opportunities for as many young people as possible. As part of the initiative, 19 students from schools in Munich participated in a tennis camp at MTTC Iphitos during the Pentecost holidays. FUTURE ACES is a joint project by the BMW Group, MMP Event, the Iphitos Tennis Club, and other partners of the ATP 500 tennis tournament BMW Open by Bitpanda.\n\nBoys and girls had the chance to apply through the organisations \"DEIN MÜNCHEN\" and the \"Kick ins Leben\" foundation, with which the BMW Group has been closely collaborating for many years. Nineteen students received four days of intensive tennis training sessions. Guided by coaches from MTTC Iphitos, they practiced basic strokes and techniques while training alongside other participants of the tennis camp. Sportswear, shoes, and rackets were provided by the partners and tennis equipment supplier Dunlop.\n\nThrough FUTURE ACES, the partners not only make tennis accessible to young people with challenging starts, but also enable them to develop personally in a supportive environment, build connections, and gain valuable experiences. This created a week full of joy for the children and teenagers during the training sessions.\n\nThe long-term FUTURE ACES programme was launched at the BMW Open by Bitpanda in April. For every ace served during the ATP 500 tournament in Munich, the three partners donated a coaching session for students and young people facing barriers to success. A total of 361 aces were served by the professionals, including German singles champion Alexander Zverev, during the tournament, resulting in 361 coaching sessions. The Pentecost camp was the first measure of the joint initiative, with more to follow - both on and off the court. The goal is to offer participants a variety of opportunities, such as information days and internships within the club and the BMW Open environment, to help them discover their potential and develop their skills - empowering them to embark on a self-determined life as FUTURE ACES."}

Following the successful utilization of renewable raw materials in racing cars, the BMW Group will now harness natural fiber composites also for its series-production models. The BMW Group reached series maturity of #natural fiber composites following several years of development and in-depth research. The composites from renewable raw materials even meet the stringent demands of roof structures in total vehicle homologation.\n\nThe flax-based lightweight components have been developed in collaboration with Bcomp, a Swiss clean-tech company, for several years now. The partnership with Bcomp supports the BMW Group’s goal of further reducing CO₂e emissions in future vehicle models. The Munich-based carmaker holds a stake in Bcomp through BMW i Ventures, the company’s venture capital arm.\n\nLightweight construction has long been a crucial development field for the BMW Group. The use of natural fibers with a reduced CO₂e footprint in composite materials has become increasingly important. Materials tests have demonstrated the fibers’ great suitability, especially for visible exterior and interior components.\n\nOne example: Exchanging carbon fiber composites for natural fiber composites in the roof of the next-generation BMW Group portfolio leads to a CO₂e-reduction of around 40% in production plus additional end-of-life considerations.\n\nThe innovative reinforcement parts made of natural fiber composites were initially used by BMW M Motorsport in the 2019 season of Formula E. Since then, the components have also been successfully used in the #BMW M4## DTM and #M4 GT4, replacing carbon fiber plastic (CFRP) parts. Since 2022, Bcomp has been an official BMW M Motorsport partner for the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nThe new lightweight materials will soon experience the ultimate performance test as they are fitted in the BMW M4 GT4 for the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring. Franciscus van Meel, CEO of #BMW M GmbH, stated: “Natural fiber composites are a vital element of innovative lightweight solutions in motorsport, allowing for a reduction in CO₂e emissions in the manufacturing process. Natural fiber is an innovation that perfectly exemplifies BMW M’s claim ‘Born on the racetrack. Made for the streets.’. This is why we are delighted to confirm the series maturity of these materials, a breakthrough we achieved with our official #BMW M Motorsport partner Bcomp. We are now looking forward to the use of these materials in future BMW M product ranges.”"}

In 2025, BMW celebrates 50 years of BMW Art Cars. To connect this legacy with the present, former Art Car juror Hans Ulrich Obrist and BMW have invited renowned artist Alvaro Barrington to transform the BMW Hydrogen VIP car fleet into a moving artwork during Art Basel in Basel 2025. This marks the second year in a row that the BMW iX5 Hydrogen fleet has been in operation at the art fair, following last year’s successful debut featuring the artwork of British artist Es Devlin.\n\nBMW has been Official Automotive Partner of Art Basel globally for over two decades, supporting creative voices that shape contemporary culture. Barrington was selected by curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, former member of the BMW Art Car jury, in line with the brand’s heritage of engaging with pioneering artistic perspectives. The resulting work, titled “Simply, 2025”, envelops the BMW iX5 Hydrogen fleet in Barrington’s distinctive visual language.\n\nAs a tribute to BMW’s pioneering work in innovative mobility, Barrington has reimagined the fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles with a striking wrap that reflects his signature collage aesthetic. Inspired by figures of cultural reinvention such as David Hockney, Richard Hamilton, Henri Matisse and Tina Turner, Barrington explores how mobility itself is evolving – not just in form, but in its emotional and cultural resonance.\n\nDrawing on in-depth conversations with BMW’s hydrogen engineers, Barrington’s concept bridges technology and humanity. Using a vivid palette and layered forms, his artwork expresses themes of transformation, nature, and technological innovation. The wrap fuses artistic vision with design precision, symbolising a future where mobility is not only sustainable but also emotionally intelligent and culturally integrated.\n\nAlvaro Barrington says: “Driving culture is one of the most important cultures in the world – billions of people participate in it. As an artist who is supposed to be involved in cultural production, it’s really interesting to be a part of this conversation about sustainability and the future of cars that BMW and the rest of the world is having.”\n\nAlvaro Barrington’s practice, rooted in painting but extending into multimedia and textiles, examines how materials carry cultural, political and personal histories. His BMW iX5 Hydrogen collaboration marks a significant moment in this journey, channelling his curiosity about the human-centric potential of technology and dynamic vision into motion through the medium of innovative transport in a joyful way.\n\nCentral to the collaboration is the BMW iX5 Hydrogen – a vehicle that showcases the brand’s pioneering role in innovative mobility and technology. As part of BMW’s presence at Art Basel in Basel 2025, the fleet will serve as the VIP car service alongside the fully electric BMW i7, reinforcing BMW’s commitment to contemporary luxury, innovation, and exclusive driving experiences.\n\n\"The collaboration with Alvaro Barrington amplifies our pioneering fuel-cell technology through the lens of art,\" says Michael Rath, Head of Hydrogen Vehicles, BMW Group. \"We are firmly committed to launching our first hydrogen-powered vehicle in 2028.\"\n\nFirst hydrogen-powered BMW production model in 2028.As part of its holistic approach and after the successful global testing of the pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles, BMW is now preparing to start the series production of vehicles with hydrogen drivetrain in 2028. The series production models will be integrated into BMW’s existing portfolio, i.e. BMW will offer an existing model in an additional hydrogen fuel cell drive system variant. As fuel cell technology is another electric vehicle technology, the BMW Group explicitly views it as complementing the drive technology used by battery electric vehicles (BEV) and next to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and internal combustion engines (ICE).\n\nThe BMW VIP car service fleet, featuring Barrington’s custom-wrapped BMW iX5 Hydrogen cars, can be seen on the streets of Basel during the fair, from 19 to 22 June 2025. The project affirms BMW’s position at the intersection of contemporary luxury, innovation, joy and artistic expression.\n\nEarlier this year, as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, BMW presented another artist-designed vehicle during the Market Art Fair in Stockholm. German artist Gregor Hildebrandt wrapped a fleet of fully electric BMW i5 and i7 models with his distinctive visual language, turning them into mobile artworks on the streets of the Swedish capital. Further artist collaborations and custom vehicle wraps are set to follow throughout the global tour.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 1,19 kg H2/100 km, CO2 emissions combined in WLTP cycle: 0 g/km.

The BMW Museum in Munich is using a special exhibition taking place as part of the international BMW Art Car World Tour to celebrate the 50-year anniversary of both the legendary BMW Art Car Collection and the iconic BMW 3 Series. The exhibition will open its doors to visitors from 17 June, hot on the heels of the Le Mans 24 Hours race weekend. Fittingly, it was at Le Mans in 1975 that the first BMW Art Car – created by Alexander Calder – staged its glittering premiere. The exhibition, which runs until 1 February 2026, will see the BMW Museum present a trio of Art Cars based on the BMW 3 Series: Sandro Chia’s BMW M3 GTR and the BMW M3 (Group A) cars designed by Michael Jagamara Nelson and Ken Done respectively. The exhibition at the BMW Museum – the home of the BMW Art Cars when they are not on display at destinations around the globe – is one of the attractions of the ongoing BMW Art Car World Tour, the largest exhibition project yet in the 50-year history of the collection. The Tour has so far visited 12 markets on five continents, and will continue to showcase the legendary BMW Art Cars across numerous art and car platforms, and at institutes worldwide, over the coming year. The BMW Museum will use the special exhibition to provide insights into the artistic brilliance and history of the BMW Art Car Collection, as well as inviting visitors to explore the technical excellence of the 3 Series and the innovative power of the BMW brand. 50 years of driving pleasure: the BMW 3 Series Since it first hit the roads in 1975, the BMW 3 Series has served as a byword for driving pleasure and a cornerstone for the success of BMW. Across five decades, it has reimagined the concept of the sports sedan, set new standards for performance and put smiles on the faces of millions of drivers around the world. From the groundbreaking first generation to today’s innovative models, the 3 Series has been an enduring, style-defining feature of the automotive landscape. 50 years of “rolling sculptures”: the BMW Art Car CollectionSince 1975, renowned artists from countries the world over have gone to work creating BMW Art Cars. The idea was the brainchild of French racing driver and art lover Hervé Poulain, who teamed up with BMW’s then Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch to invite friend and artist Alexander Calder to paint a design onto a car. The result was a BMW 3.0 CSL that competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975, becoming a darling of the crowd – and marking the birth of the BMW Art Car Collection. Famous names including Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer and Ólafur Elíasson have since added further BMW Art Cars bearing their own individual style to the collection. More recently, the American John Baldessari and Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei used the BMW M6 GTLM and BMW M6 GT3 respectively as a canvas for their takes on the BMW Art Car concept in 2016 and 2017. They therefore joined Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu in applying their creativity to dynamic racing cars in the last 15 years. BMW Art Cars at the BMW Museum from 17 June BMW M3 Group A by Ken Done (1989): Australian artist Ken Done created a vibrant and richly coloured design that captures the energy and dynamism of motor racing. His work represents a homage to the speed and power of the BMW M3. “It was a great honour to be asked to be part of this fabulous Art Car collection. I wanted to express the joy of speed and the brilliance of the machine itself.” Ken Done BMW M3 Group A by Michael Jagamara Nelson (1989):Michael Jagamara Nelson, also from Australia, brought the traditions of Aboriginal art to the bodywork of the BMW M3. His complex motifs using dot painting techniques tell Dreaming stories that are deeply rooted in the culture of his people. “A car is a landscape as it would be seen from a plane – I have included water, the kangaroo and the opossum.” Michael Jagamara Nelson BMW M3 GTR by Sandro Chia (1992): Italian artist Sandro Chia transformed a BMW M3 GTR into a painting on wheels that depicts human figures and emotions in vivid colours. His work symbolises the connection between man and machine, and invites us to reflect on the role of the car in modern society. “I have created both a picture and a world. Everything that is looked at closely turns into a face. A face is a focus, a focus of life and the world.” Sandro Chia The 10th BMW Art Car, a BMW 730i designed by Spanish artist César Manrique in 1990, is also on show at the BMW Museum as part of its permanent exhibition.

BMW M Motorsport experienced just how relentless the legendary endurance classic can be during the 93rd edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars demonstrated strong pace, as they have throughout the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season, and were in contention for a top-five result for much of the race. However, a frustrating final stage saw both cars suffer technical issues. While they managed to finish the race, they did not achieve the positions they deserved. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO led the LMGT3 class for many hours, but both cars retired during the night.\n\nThe two BMW M Team WRT Hypercars reached Hyperpole 2 in qualifying and started the race from fourth and sixth positions. Over the first 22 hours, they ran without major issues, apart from a drive-through penalty for car #20, and consistently hovered around fifth place. However, technical problems in the final hours dashed their hopes for top results. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), suffered a cooling issue with the hybrid system. Meanwhile, the sister car, driven by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), encountered an engine problem. Both cars crossed the finish line after repairs but were classified only in 18th and 19th positions.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, driven by Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), shone in qualifying with fastest laps set by Al Harthy and van der Linde, as well as a third-place starting position secured by Rossi in Hyperpole 2. During the race, the car led for long stretches thanks to consistent performances by the drivers and excellent work by Team WRT. However, around 3 a.m., the car retired due to an as-yet-unknown electrical issue, which caused the power steering to fail and van der Linde to roll straight into the gravel trap. Although he managed to return to the pits after some time, the team decided to retire the car for safety reasons. The #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from The Bend Team WRT, driven by Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS), steadily moved up from 16th on the grid and was already in the top-eight when it hit a rabbit on track. The collision caused severe damage to the radiator and other components, making repairs impossible.\n\nFollowing the disappointing results at Le Mans, BMW M Motorsport now turns its attention to the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER) next weekend, followed by the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) a week later. BMW M factory drivers Farfus, Marciello, and Kelvin van der Linde face the unique challenge of competing in all three endurance classics. Meanwhile, Sheldon van der Linde and Vanthoor will travel to the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen (USA) in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, where they will share the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars from BMW M Team RLL with Philipp Eng (AUT) and Marco Wittmann (GER). From the U.S., the driver quartet will head directly to Spa-Francorchamps.\n\nComments after the 24h Le Mans:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “For BMW M Motorsport, the 2025 edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans was very tough in the end. We had four cars that were all very competitive throughout the whole week. In qualifying and also in race pace we were able to fight for good results. On three cars we had technical issues unfortunately, and then even bad luck with the fourth one hitting a rabbit at night. It’s a tough one to swallow, but we also have to take the positives. We had very competitive cars in both classes. A big thank you to the entire crew, who have been continuously working on development since last year. However, in the end, we want to be on the podium, and we didn’t achieve that this time. We collected a lot of data and will work hard to come back and be on the podium next time.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “It’s a disappointing end of the weekend. It looked quite good, but we hit some issues two hours from the end and had to do some work on both Hypercars. I’m feeling very sorry for all the guys who have put so much effort in the preparation for this race in the last twelve months. But this is what motorsport is made of. That’s why we like it. We want to hit back as soon as possible. In LMGT3 it looked very good. We had a good car, good strategy, good drivers. But unfortunately we had an electrical issue with car #46 and a poor little rabbit being hit by our #31. That accident caused a broken radiator that we couldn’t repair.”\n\nRobin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 18th place): “Le Mans done. Actually the race started pretty well. We were expecting the Ferraris to be quick, which they were from the start. The Porsche #6 came to the front very early in the race. I think we were good enough for P5 today but we had a drive through penalty during the night which was very painful. We tried to recover from it from then but we actually never did. In the end we had an engine issue which brought us back about 20 laps. Onto the next one.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 19th place): “For sure not the weekend we wanted. It's very dissapointing – not only for us but also for car #20. We need to make some changes after the last two disappointing Le Mans races for the future in order to improve. Hopefully the 24h Nürburgring will be a good one. We try our best.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF): “It was a tough Le Mans. They say you can't win Le Mans; Le Mans chooses its winners. That definitely applies to us. Maybe we couldn't have won, but I think we would have had a chance to fight for the podium, just like last year. Team WRT did a fantastic job, and it's very unfortunate that we couldn't bring either of our cars to the finish. The good thing for me is that I have three 24-hour races in a row, so next week at the Nürburgring, I have the chance to achieve a top result. From now on, that's where the focus lies.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF): “The incident was very strange. Suddenly, the car shut down, and with it, the power steering failed, leaving me no option but to go straight through the gravel trap. Luckily, there was a large run-off area at that part of the track. The retirement is extremely disappointing because we led the race for many hours. Although we didn't have the fastest car, we would have had good chances due to our consistency. Unfortunately, that's part of motorsport. Next week at the Nürburgring, we have the next opportunity.”"}

In front of more than 76,000 spectators and under sweltering summer heat, he won all three races at the Adriatic coast on his BMW M 1000 RR from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. As a result, he reduced his gap to championship leader Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) to just nine points. His teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) retired from race one, finished 12th in the Superpole Race on Sunday, and broke into the top ten with a 10th-place finish in race two. Misano hosted the sixth of twelve rounds this season. The championship continues from 11th to 13th July at Donington Park (GBR).\n\nReactions after the Misano round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an incredible weekend for the whole team. We have shown in recent races how we have fought our way back. To achieve the hat-trick here at Misano, especially after all the commotion surrounding Toprak’s move to MotoGP, is just an amazing feeling for the team. We’re very proud of what everyone has achieved. It was an indescribable weekend for us. On Mickey’s side, it was a tough weekend. I think he showed in the final race with a top ten result that he can also get towards the front. We’ll definitely keep working on that. All in all, BMW as a brand had the perfect showing here – we are incredibly proud and heading to Donington with our heads held high. We’re back in the title fight, and with Toprak’s current momentum, anything is possible. We will give it everything.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “The message sent this weekend is very clear: we have the best team here in the paddock, and we have the best team at the headquarters in Munich – this was an absolute team effort. Toprak delivered an outstanding performance, but to put the bike on top three times here at Misano – which is one of the most challenging tracks for us due to the thermal conditions and grip levels – and to set the fastest lap in each race is a complete team achievement. It showcases the strength of the BMW brand, the team, the rider, and the passion we all bring to the table. Unfortunately, the mechanics can’t refresh themselves with a well-deserved ice cream and cold drink just yet – they now have to completely strip down Toprak’s bike for a technical inspection. We’re looking ahead to the outcome with confidence and are already looking forward to Donington.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First I would like to say thanks to my team because they did an incredible job the whole weekend. We could improve the bike every session, especially for race two it was really good. I still had a small issue in corner four but anyway, I could manage it in the race. I had a strong pace and was pushing so hard because even though Bulega started from tenth position, I knew he will be fast and will catch up. So I had to push straight from the start. All in all I’m really happy – we did three wins as last year. Now I’m looking forward to the next races. The wins here made me even more motivated and I can’t wait to go to Donington now.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We’ve honestly struggled a lot this weekend. We’ve tried so many things with the bike, but it just never got any faster and I never got a good feeling, plus a couple of stupid crashes. Honestly, it was a big mess all in all. But of course, we’ve all tried as hard as we could, we never gave up but it was very difficult. Even race two, the feeling wasn’t there, but at least we’ve scored some good points. I’m not really happy with my weekend but I am really happy for everyone in the team who work non-stop. I’m looking forward to Donington now, we will be ready again.”\n\nAir temperature: 28°, track temperature: 40°, humidity: 60%, conditions: dry.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 30°, track temperature: 47°, humidity: 49%, conditions: dry, laps: 21.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 9, 1:33.201\n\nAir temperature: 29°, track temperature: 42°, humidity: 60%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:32.813\n\nAir temperature: 32°, track temperature: 48°, humidity: 54%, conditions: dry, laps: 21.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 6, 1:33.471\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R06/12, after 18 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R06/12, after 18 of 36 races)."}

German golf fans can look forward to a world-class field at the BMW International Open, featuring nearly the entire current Top 30 of the DP World Tour season rankings. Additionally, the tournament will showcase an exciting mix of past champions from the event's 36-year history and young players poised for bright futures.\n\nEwen Ferguson returns to GC München Eichenried as the defending champion after his emotional triumph last year – and he arrives in excellent form. The Scotsman recently finished tied for second and fourth in his last two DP World Tour events. One of the tournament's record winners, Pablo Larrazábal (ESP), who triumphed in Eichenried in 2011 and 2015, will also be back in Munich.\n\nOther former champions in the field include Martin Kaymer (GER, 2008), Fabrizio Zanotti (PAR, 2014), Andrea Pavan (ITA, 2019), and Li Haotong (CHN, 2022). Li, who won the Qatar Masters in February and has consistently delivered strong performances since, currently ranks fifth in the “Race to Dubai”. Additionally, the second and fourth-ranked players in the standings, England's Laurie Canter and John Parry, will also compete at the BMW International Open. The winner of the first BMW tournament of the current DP World Tour season will also be present in Munich: Elvis Smylie (AUS) triumphed in November 2024 at the inaugural BMW Australian PGA Championship in Brisbane.\n\nThree of the eight wildcard spots granted by tournament organiser BMW will go to promising young players with the potential for stellar careers: Tiger Christensen (GER), David Puig (ESP), and Taiga Semikawa (JPN).\n\nSemikawa, 24, was named after Tiger Woods by his parents, despite the different spelling. Before turning professional in 2022, he reached the top of the amateur world rankings. Last Sunday, Semikawa claimed his fifth title on the Japan Golf Tour by winning the BMW Japan Golf Tour Championship. As part of BMW Group's global commitment to golf, the winner of this tournament receives an invitation to the BMW International Open.\n\nChristensen, whose first name also reflects his father's admiration for the 15-time major champion, is a 21-year-old from Hamburg. In 2023, as an amateur, he experienced major championship play first-hand, qualifying for The Open at the “Final Qualifying”, where he outperformed Ryder Cup stars Sergio García (ESP) and Graeme McDowell (NIR). Christensen turned professional at the end of last year.\n\nPuig has been a professional golfer since 2022 and previously represented Europe at the 2018 Junior Ryder Cup in France. The 23-year-old has already competed in three majors, making a splash despite missing the cut at The Open in 2024. The Spaniard finished tied for 39th at the 2023 U.S. Open and tied for 60th at this year's PGA Championship just a few weeks ago.\n\nTogether with other notable participants such as Sergio García, Patrick Reed (USA), and Luke Donald (ENG), as well as top German players Stephan Jäger, Martin Kaymer, Matti Schmid, Marcel Siem, and Nicolai von Dellingshausen, the tournament boasts a stellar lineup that promises thrilling competition for the coveted title.\n\nTickets for the BMW International Open are available at:"}

With its mixture of high-tech and humour, the campaign shows how these technologies make drivers’ everyday lives significantly more comfortable as well as safer. So far, BMW has published entertaining short videos about the BMW Digital Key/ BMW Digital Key Plus on the Apple Watch, the Motorway Assistant, Remote Control Parking and BMW Curve-Ahead View. Two further films are due to follow – all of them featuring unusual situations unlikely to be covered by any manual. Munich. Over the course of six creative social media films, BMW demonstrates how modern technology takes the driving experience to a new level. The BMW innovation campaign underscores the brand’s premium appeal – and features the tongue-in-cheek humour that has become a BMW hallmark. The films tell short stories in which digital features are not only helpers, but sometimes even become friendly accomplices. Also in starring roles: the BMW i5, BMW iX, BMW X1, BMW X3 and BMW X5, representing the wide range of digital features offered by many BMW model series.\n\n“The BMW innovation campaign is about our promise to combine technology and driving pleasure in a unique way. We use humour to show how our digital features don’t just assist drivers but become faithful companions in everyday life,” says Bernd Körber, Senior Vice President BMW Brand and Product Management.\n\nBenefits of advanced technology, explained in a charming and entertaining way. The BMW Digital Key or BMW Digital Key Plus replaces the physical vehicle key. The feature also enables owners to use an Apple Watch to unlock, start and lock their vehicle. This is a major plot element in the short film called “Tight”. The protagonist really does not have room for a vehicle key in his tight trousers, so he uses his Apple Watch in order to start his BMW X3 for a night out. Intelligent technology ensures that the size of his pockets does not limit his freedom.\n\nThe motorway assistant offers automated driving at Level 2+ and is a highlight in the range of BMW driver assistance systems. On motorways and dual carriageways, it provides active steering assistance at speeds of up to 130 km/h. A particularly innovative feature is the Active Lane Change Assistant with eye activation, available in selected markets. Drivers always remain responsible, but they are able to take their hands off the wheel at certain times. This comes in very handy indeed in the short film titled “Mustache”. Sitting at the wheel of his BMW i5, the driver uses the motorway assistant so he can twirl the ends of his mustache into shape with his fingertips and put on his sunglasses, for maximum cool factor.\n\nThe campaign’s “Top Dog” film features a deliveryman who comes across an unbelievable scene: a dog sitting at the wheel of a BMW X5 smoothly steers the vehicle backwards out of a garage, a look of intense concentration on its face. But this feat is actually the result of human and artificial intelligence: the owner is controlling the car from outside via her smartphone – using the My BMW app’s Remote Control Parking function. This enables the driver to perform precise parking manoeuvres from outside the vehicle, so tight garages or narrow parking spaces are no longer a problem. The amazing scene is in fact another example of intelligent BMW technology making everyday life easier.\n\nSmall break, great fun. In-car gaming can lead to surprising results – as the BMW innovation campaign shows in the short film titled “Race”. A businessman is enjoying a relaxed break while recharging the battery of his BMW i5 when the driver of a muscle car suddenly appears and challenges him to a race. However, the contest does not take place on the road, but in virtual reality, on the BMW Curved Display in the BMW i5 – using smartphones as controllers. What follows is an unusual showdown in a casual game. In the end, the rival’s stylish sunglasses go to the driver of the BMW i5, as a victory trophy. But the in-car gaming feature is a lot of fun, even when there are no strangers issuing challenges. In multiplayer mode, up to four people can play at the same time. The BMW Group partners with the AirConsole gaming platform for its in-car gaming support.\n\nDigital solutions – in the right place and at the right time. Sometimes it’s good to know what lies ahead, even if you can’t see it yet. That’s exactly what the BMW Curve-Ahead View in the BMW X1 is designed for: it recognises upcoming bends and highlights them in colour on the BMW Head-Up Display. In addition, the driver receives real-time feedback on their current speed – both before and during a bend. This makes for a better sense of control while also increasing safety and driving comfort.\n\nThe film “Fish” provides a charming demonstration of how useful this can be in practice: a BMW X1 is carrying moving boxes – and in the middle of it all is a goldfish in a transport bag, on its way to a new home. A winding road lies ahead, and right next to the vulnerable passenger is a box full of bristling cactus spines ... BMW Curve-Ahead View is available for all BMW models equipped with Operating System 9 and BMW Digital Premium.\n\nUnderstands every word: intelligent BMW technology. The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant is the digital point of contact in all new BMW models. It understands natural language, answers questions, explains vehicle functions and – depending on the situation – can become a humorous companion or even a co-conspirator. As in the film “Bye, Honey”, in which the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant aids and abets a mom driving a BMW iX. She tries in vain to engage her daughter in a conversation. Even a dramatic countdown – “5, 4 ...” – with the tongue-in-cheek request to activate the ejector seat elicits no response. Only when the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant matter-of-factly continues “3, 2, 1 ...” does the daughter suddenly prick up her ears and turn to her mother, alarmed. The mystery is quickly solved. “It was just a joke,” the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant explains – and immediately adds a suitable route recommendation to the nearest burger restaurant."}

The BMW Group is industrialising its Virtual Factory, with production planners continuously scaling applications in the digital twins of over 30 production sites to accelerate production planning worldwide. What once required several weeks of real-world modifications and testing can now be precisely simulated in the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory. To create optimal conditions for upcoming launches at the plants, the BMW Group will integrate more than 40 new or updated vehicles into its global production between now and 2027. This will first be done virtually to ensure immediate stability at the plants. Going forward, the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory is projected to reduce production planning costs by up to 30 percent.\n\nVirtual planning is a core element of the BMW Group iFACTORY and involves a wide range of tools. The intelligent linking of building data, equipment data, logistics data, vehicle data and even 3D simulation of manual work processes creates digital twins of all BMW Group plants worldwide. In an industrial 3D metaverse application based on NVIDIA Omniverse, simulations can be performed in real time, enabling virtual optimisation of layouts, robotics and logistics systems. The BMW Group’s Virtual Factory is continuously expanding to incorporate generative and agentic AI functionalities and assistants.\n\nDigital, automated, fast: Collision checks for new vehicle models\n\nFor every launch, it is essential to verify that the new product fits on the production line and does not collide with its surroundings at any point. In the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory, this collision check is digital, automated and fast, using construction data combined with 3D scans. The movement and rotation of a vehicle through the production lines are precisely simulated, allowing the system to automatically check for possible collisions. What now takes just three days to simulate virtually previously required almost four weeks of real testing.\n\nIn the past, a real vehicle body had to be manually guided through the production lines – often over several weekends – to identify potential collisions. In the paint shop, this process sometimes required completely emptying and cleaning the dip coating tanks where vehicle bodies are submerged for priming. The costs and time investment for this were enormous.\n\nGrowing number of scalable applications\n\nThe BMW Group's Virtual Factory is rapidly evolving, enabling an increasing number of applications to be scaled. In addition to virtual, automated collision checks, this includes human simulation to optimise manual production steps and automated identification of maps of the surroundings from existing 3D scans for smart transport systems.\n\nLearn more about the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory at NVIDIA GTC Paris:\n\nThursday, 12 June 2025 from 11:00 a.m. to 11:45 a.m. CEST.\n\nAccelerating Automotive Innovation with Accelerated Computing, Digital Twins and AI by the BMW Group."}

The development of the first #Neue Klasse series production model is on the finishing straight: prototypes of the next-generation BMW iX3 are currently undergoing extensive testing in Miramas, southern France. The Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) will celebrate its world premiere at the #IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich in September and roll off the production line at the new BMW Group plant in #Debrecen (Hungary) starting at the end of the year. “Longer range, faster charging, an all-new display and operating concept, and the intelligence of four superbrains are the distinguishing features of the Neue Klasse. With the upcoming BMW iX3 – the first model of the new car generation – we are introducing fundamental technology upgrades with the clear aim of raising the typical BMW driving pleasure to a whole new level,” says Mike Reichelt, Head of Neue Klasse BMW. “With the all-new #BMW iX3, we bring our revolutionary technologies into series production for the first time, and we can hardly wait to see it in action on the road. All future BMW models, regardless of powertrain type, will benefit from the innovations and technology clusters of the Neue Klasse.\" The new technologies at a glance:\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive: “Hands on the Wheel, Eyes on the Road”. The BMW Panoramic iDrive shows all relevant driving information in the driver’s ideal line of sight and maximizes ergonomic efficiency and safety. Four elements come together to make a unique user experience:\n\nThe BMW Panoramic iDrive runs under the BMW Operating System X, also a new development. It offers extensive customizability, intelligent support for the driver and extensive software updates. BMW’s motto “Hands on the Wheel, Eyes on the Road” is redefined with a well-balanced mix of physical controls and digital functions. BMW Panoramic iDrive will ensure user-friendly and intuitive operation in every vehicle segment and with every powertrain concept. Next generation of electric powertrains. The high-voltage battery concept for the 6th generation of BMW eDrive technology (Gen6) is fundamentally new, and together with the revised electric drive system portfolio, offers an optimum solution for all vehicle segments. The Gen6 system will be making its debut in the BMW iX3 and will then be rolled out across all vehicle segments.The centerpiece of the high-voltage battery – the BMW cylindrical battery cell – has an energy density of 20 per cent greater that the prismatic cells previously used. The cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery, which plays an important role in the body structure of Neue Klasse models. Charge faster, drive further.The Gen6 introduces a major leap forward for our customers and the BMW iX3 is the first to benefit. With 400kW maximum charging, our customers can add over 350km* maximum (WLTP) to their vehicle’s range in just 10 minutes. Gen6 technology allows users to monitor the charging performance and curve live via the My BMW App. 800V technology is paving the way for rapid charging. Charging at 400V DC charging stations will, of course, still be possible.The high energy content of the high-voltage battery, together with the efficient design of the powertrain and the overall vehicle, enables a range of up to 800km (WLTP). Further charging-related innovations.Making the charging process even more user friendly is the intelligent charging flap, which detects when the driver is intending to stop to charge the car and opens (and then closes) automatically. One of the triggers for opening the flap is AI-assisted: if the customer approaches a familiar or learned charging point, the progress towards it reveals an intention to charge and the flap opens. The SoP of the new BMW iX3 will also introduce extensive bidirectional charging functions – to-Load, to-Home and to-Grid:Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) turns the vehicle into a powerful mobile powerbank (up to 3.7kW in Europe) and supplies energy for one or several consumers, wherever customers need it. Bidirectional charging capability turns the BMW iX3 into an at-home energy storage unit. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) helps customers to reduce costs. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) sets new standards for the integration of the vehicle into the energy market. Both functions contribute to lowering emissions and increasing the use of regenerative energy sources. In this way, the BMW Group demonstrates that it is part of the solution as we work towards energy transformation. Providing the key to bidirectional charging alongside the technology involved, the new BMW Wallbox (DC) offers 19.2kW charging and discharging depending on the market. The BMW charging equipment has been redesigned and is now easier to use, and now also includes selected adapters e.g. for vehicle-to-load (V2L) use cases. The BMW driving experience with the Heart of Joy. The level in sheer driving pleasure. The \"superbrain\" Heart of Joy in the Neue Klasse raises driving dynamics to a new level. Together with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack, the Heart of Joy is pivotal to powertrain, brakes, recuperation and sub-functions of the steering system. It processes information ten times faster* than previous systems and therefore responds more directly than ever to the driver’s command. Fewer control inputs are required, directional stability is more precise and stable. As a result, the vehicle develops consistent and reproducible cornering characteristics and can be steered intuitively. Powertrain and braking functions also work together harmoniously to decelerate the vehicle. Recuperation can be used across the whole speed range down to a standstill. Indeed, in 98 percent of cases, the vehicle can be brought to a standstill without applying the friction brakes – without noise or jolts. The Heart of Joy and BMW Dynamic Performance Control raise the BMW driving experience to a new level – from standstill to dynamic limits. Further development of driver assistance systems using the intelligent high-performance computer “Superbrain of Automated Driving” BMW Group’s latest driver assistance systems are among the world’s best. The new BMW iX3 ushers in the rollout of the next technology generation. This is in keeping with BMW’s ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) philosophy: “Always smart, symbiotic, and safe”. The BMW Group merges the proven, rule-based assistance system with a new system based on AI. In an optimum symbiosis, this combination supports the driver even more precisely and reliably in challenging situations on the road. The Superbrain of Automated Driving pools all customer functions for automated driving and has a 20 times faster processing speed than the previous system. The new automated driving and parking functions are based on cutting-edge sensor, software, processor, and mobile communications technology. The basic model of the BMW iX3 offers functions like lane change warning, road priority warning, safe exit, and assisted view. Safe exit uses side-mounted radars to monitor traffic next to the car while stopping and warns the driver of approaching objects. The new Assisted View shows the latest driving situation precisely and in detail alternatively in the Central Display, the Panoramic Vision, or 3D Head-Up Display. The motorway assistant with automatic lane change will be available with extended features in the BMW iX3. Upon request, it can assist drivers from when they join a motorway to when they leave it and allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods. This assistant remains active even during automated motorway changes along an active navigation route. The new Motorway & City Assistant helps the driver in complex driving situations in urban areas, e.g. through tight corners or roundabouts. It brakes automatically at red traffic lights and moves off again or sounds an audible signal when lights turn green. Symbiotic driver assistance, as it is known, enables perfect interaction between tech and driver regarding both comfort and safety functions, and creates a seamless transition between cooperative steering and – a world first – cooperative braking. When the function is active, the driver can influence the system at any time without causing the assistant to be switched off by turning the steering wheel or applying brakes just a little in order to adjust the responses of the system. The parking functions can be activated intuitively and offer an AI-based selection of parking assistance services, parking space recognition, maneuver planning, and an improved parking experience. Extended monitoring functions help the driver to avoid damage to the vehicle while parking the car. Neue Klasse innovations are AI-based, smart and update-compatible. Thanks to the all-new electronics and software architecture with four superbrains (high-performance computers), the new BMW iX3 is now noticeably more intelligent in everyday situations – e.g. with the advanced driver assistance systems and improved voice assistant BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. Due to the powerful BMW Cloud, the new electronics and software architecture of the new vehicle generation is ready for numerous smart features, which customers can benefit from via over-the-air updates after the market launch. A large number of the patent applications filed by BMW in recent years have come about as part of the development of technologies for the Neue Klasse – e.g. in the projection technology for the BMW Panoramic Vision, in the innovative control functions of the Heart of Joy, in the battery management and cell contacting system of the high-voltage battery, in the new electric motor, and in the new, zonal vehicle electrical system. * As this is a development-phase prototype, the figures given are provisional. Energy consumption information according to WLTP is not yet available.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: * As this is a development-phase prototype, energy consumption information according to WLTP is not available yet."}

The month of endurance racing highlights has begun. With the scrutineering in the city centre and the official test day, BMW M Motorsport has kicked off the mega event of the year, the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA, 14th/15th June). BMW M Team WRT is fielding two BMW M Hybrid V8s in the Hypercar class. In the LMGT3 class, the EVO version of the BMW M4 GT3 is making its debut. The goal for both cars is the podium. Around the race, which is once again expected to draw more than 300,000 spectators, BMW M Motorsport is offering an extensive support programme. At BMW Welt in Munich (GER), there will be a public viewing event. The Le Mans race week will be immediately followed by two more 24-hour classics at the Nürburgring (GER, 21st/22nd June) and Spa-Francorchamps (BEL, 28th/29th June).\n\nThe weekend before the actual race is traditionally a highlight for Le Mans fans. The reason for this is the scrutineering. The technical inspection of the cars takes place right in the city centre, and the drivers take plenty of time to interact with the fans. Last Sunday, the only test day on the Circuit de la Sarthe was on the schedule. BMW M Team WRT used this opportunity to complete a total of 130 laps with the two BMW M Hybrid V8s. The two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs managed 125 laps on the 13.626-kilometre circuit.\n\nIn the cockpit of the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) will alternate. The #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 will be driven by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). As reserve drivers for the two hypercars, Philipp Eng (AUT) and Marco Wittmann (GER) are on-site in Le Mans. The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO, car #31, will be shared by Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS). In the #46 car of Team WRT, Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) will compete. The 24 Hours of Le Mans will start next Saturday at 16:00 CEST.\n\nTeam WRT is also represented in the Road to Le Mans support races with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Samantha Tan (CAN) and Gustav Bergström (SWE) will race in the #38 car.\n\nFor the three BMW M works drivers Augusto Farfus, Raffaele Marciello, and Kelvin van der Linde, the journey continues directly from Le Mans to the Nürburgring and then to Spa-Francorchamps. This driver trio faces the unique challenge of competing in all three endurance classics.\n\nBMW Welt in Munich welcomes everyone who has the time and interest to a public viewing event with numerous special attractions during the race weekend. BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) and BMW M Team BS+COMPETITION sim racer Nils Naujoks (GER) will moderate the race action and be available for meet and greet sessions with fans. Additional attractions, such as the BMW M SIM Challenge and a Carrera track, will provide plenty of entertainment.\n\nComments ahead of the 24h Le Mans:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “In general, it's always crucial to complete as many kilometres as possible at the Le Mans Prologue, as there are no other opportunities to test on this track. Therefore, it was important to gather a lot of information. We worked through a tight testing programme and stayed focused on it. I think we did a very good job. Of course, it was a bit frustrating that we had to retire car #20 early. We’ll investigate it, but it wasn’t a major issue. We’re missing a few kilometres there, but overall, we can be very satisfied with the test. Now we’re focusing on race week and drawing the right conclusions from the data and information we’ve gathered.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “The test day is always an important day at Le Mans, and we have a lot of kilometres in the box. Now let’s analyse this, and then we will also know more about the issue we had on car #20. Overall the feeling is good, we achieved the entire run plan. On the GT3 side, there is still a lot of work. Let’s analyse how we can improve there and we will see on Wednesday was is achievable.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8): “It was nice to do my first laps here in the BMW M Hybrid V8 at the La Sarthe circuit. We had a decent day. The car feels in the window, it’s still a lot of practice to finetune but it was nice to do the first laps and I am looking forward to the Le Mans race.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8): “It is amazing to be at Le Mans again for my second running. The day started off very cleanly and very smoothly. We had no issues and were very happy with the car and the steps we have been making since last year, as well. It’s good to see the improvement that we’ve made in one year. It’s much bigger than I expected and that’s very positive. In the afternoon, unfortunately, we had a small issue where we had to stop the car and caused a red flag. We have to analyse it and will be back for the race week.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “We definitely started the test day much better prepared than last year. Overall I think we have a good package. It is still difficult to understand how competitive we are but I think we made solid steps. We learned a lot on the car, now we start to put all together and we will be ready for the race weekend.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “The first day of testing was good. I enjoyed it a lot; Le Mans is always great. It’s a lot of fun to drive, and I have a good feeling with the car. It worked well. It’s always difficult to understand our level compared to our opponents; it’s still too early. But the first feeling is good. We have to continue to work to improve in some areas but I am happy about the day.”"}

A lot of space in a small area and impressive driving pleasure with high everyday efficiency - these do not have to be contradictory: The MINI Aceman E creates these connections in a unique way. The all-electric crossover is the latest MINI model and, in terms of its proportions, occupies its very own place between the MINI Cooper and the MINI Countryman. Its drive and urban character make the Aceman an unmistakable member of the MINI family.\n\nCompact crossover with room for everyone and everything. With a length of just over four metres, the manoeuvrable MINI Aceman is ideal for city traffic. Thanks to the typical MINI design principle of ‘Clever Use of Space’, the interior offers comfortable space for up to five people. The versatile luggage compartment with a load volume of 300 litres can be easily extended to up to 1,005 litres, so that shopping and sports equipment can be stowed away just as easily as luggage and more. A practical everyday companion - with space for everything and everyone.\n\nThe design language of the body of the MINI Aceman is characterised by compact proportions and clear lines and edges. The brand-typical front end has been rethought for this model: the octagonal radiator grille with its extended surround extends into the lower section of the front apron. The striking headlights complement the expressive appearance and create a high recognition value. The strikingly angular profile of the MINI Aceman from the front creates a sporty presence. Its strikingly flared wheels with 18-inch Slide 2-tone rims and the standard roof rails emphasise the adventurous spirit of the crossover even beyond the city limits.\n\nLonger adventures thanks to range and fast charging. Thanks to its range of 309 kilometres determined in the WLTP test cycle, the MINI Aceman E is not only the perfect companion in urban environments: with the powerful 42.5 kWh battery, longer adventures are also possible with the all-electric drive. The all-electric four-door model can be charged both in public spaces and conveniently at home. Innovative technologies optimise the flexible charging of the battery: the starting time and time window as well as a specific target value for the battery capacity can be precisely determined with little effort. For a comfortable start to the journey, the vehicle can not only be charged up to a specified time, but can also be air-conditioned to the desired temperature. The charging process, including charging time, costs and battery status, can be conveniently tracked at any time from anywhere using the MINI app.\n\nFour trims ensure a personalised appearance. Numerous expressive paint finishes and up to three different contrasting colours for the roof enable individual configurations and a unique MINI Aceman for every aesthetic. Four different trims can be used to give the model an additional individual expression: Essential Trim, Classic Trim and Favoured Trim each highlight different vehicle components in particular. The John Cooper Works Trim gives the MINI Aceman a motorsport look with its own front and rear design, all-round trim in high-gloss black and numerous accents in Chilli Red.Inside, the MINI Aceman is characterised by a reduction to the essentials and a rounded design language. With the compact steering wheel, the round central instrument and the characteristic toggle switch strip, the interior is clearly in the tradition of the classic MINI interior. High-contrast textile surfaces and comfortable seats round off the high-quality interior appointments. From here, adventures can be experienced comfortably and clearly - in the city and beyond.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact: Corporate Communications\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Aceman E (electricity consumption combined: 14,7 – 14,1 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 298 - 309)."}

What a weekend for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at Zandvoort (NED)! René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER) celebrated a 1-2 finish in the Sunday race at the third DTM event of the season. Rast set a new DTM record with his pole position for the race. With 26 career poles, he surpassed Bernd Schneider (GER) to become the sole record holder. Wittmann also reached a significant milestone, competing in his 200th DTM race on Sunday – a mark achieved by only seven other drivers in the series' history. His second-place finish on the podium was a fitting reward. In the ADAC GT Masters, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved a 1-2 result and a total of four podium finishes.\n\nSchubert Motorsport started the weekend strongly with first and third places in qualifying for the Sunday race, which was held on Friday due to the simultaneous Le Mans test. On Saturday, both drivers struggled on a wet track during the second qualifying session but made impressive comebacks in the race under changing weather conditions. Rast’s comeback ended with a retirement after an accident on a damp track, while Wittmann gained 14 positions to finish sixth.\n\nSunday’s race remained dry, and both Rast and Wittmann had excellent starts. Wittmann slotted into second place right behind Rast and was able to apply pressure in the final third of the race. However, the order remained unchanged, and both drivers celebrated the 1-2 result together. After the race, Rast complained of headaches and dizziness and was examined at the medical centre and later at a clinic in Haarlem (NED) as a precaution. This examination has given him the green light for his onward journey to Le Mans (FRA). He had hit his head before the race. In the drivers' standings, Rast moved up to second place with 75 points, 16 points behind leader Lucas Auer (AUT, Mercedes). Wittmann is sixth with 70 points. In the team standings, Schubert Motorsport is third with 139 points.\n\nWittmann reaches milestone of 200 DTM races. In Sunday’s race at Zandvoort, Wittmann became only the eighth driver in DTM history to reach the milestone of 200 races. Remarkably, all 200 races have been with BMW M Motorsport. Wittmann joined the DTM in 2012 at the age of 22 as a test and reserve driver and has been a full-time driver since 2013. He has won 19 of his 200 races, stood on the podium 47 times, and started from pole position 16 times. Wittmann was crowned champion in 2014 and 2016, both times driving the BMW M4 DTM. His first victory came at the 2014 season opener at Hockenheim (GER), and his most recent win was exactly one year ago in the Sunday race at Zandvoort.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Stellar weekend for FK Performance Motorsport. The ADAC GT Masters was even more successful for the BMW M Motorsport teams than the DTM. FK Performance Motorsport celebrated a 1-2 result with its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs on Sunday. Tim Zimmermann (GER) and Leyton Fourie (RSA) triumphed ahead of their teammates Julian Hanses (GER) and Eduardo Coseteng (PHI). On Saturday, Zimmermann and Fourie had already finished second on the podium, while Hanses and Coseteng came fourth. Sandro and Juliano Holzem (both GER) from Schubert Motorsport secured third place in Saturday’s race with their BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nComments on the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"What a fantastic weekend at Zandvoort. The 1-2 result in the DTM was a demonstration of the strength of our BMW M4 GT3 EVO. René Rast made a fantastic comeback after his retirement on Saturday, recovering many of the points he lost with his victory and pole position. Marco Wittmann drove exceptionally strong races on both days. I’m also incredibly thrilled about the results in the ADAC GT Masters. What FK Performance Motorsport achieved this weekend is incredible. A 1-2 finish on Sunday and second and fourth places on Saturday – simply fantastic! Schubert Motorsport also secured a podium finish on Saturday with third place. What more can you say about this weekend? It was simply a dream!\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): \"With this 1-2 result we’ve put ourselves back in the title race and shown that we’re back. We achieved the maximum, which unfortunately wasn’t the case on Saturday. Marco Wittmann’s sixth place was very good damage control, but more would have been possible if we had taken the risk of starting one car on slicks. Ultimately, it was a 50:50 decision, and like most of the field, we opted for wet tyres. In hindsight, slicks would have been better, but in such situations, it’s easy to get it wrong. Now we head to the Norisring, where we’ve been strong in the past and have already won races. We want to build on that.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: DNF, R2: 1st place): \"The team did a fantastic job and deserved this victory. For me, it wasn’t an easy race. After hitting my head before the start, I experienced pain during the race. I’m happy that I was able to move up in the drivers' standings after Saturday’s retirement thanks to the victory. I’m now second and still have every chance to fulfill my ‘Mission 4.’\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 6th place, R2: 2nd place): \"What a team result! We can be very happy with first and second places. René had very strong pace at the start of the race, but in the final stint, the tide turned, and I was able to close the gap. Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite enough for an attack, but with yesterday’s comeback and today’s podium, I’m very satisfied. Celebrating my 200th DTM race on the podium is something truly special.\""}

Over the course of eight hours on the famously demanding ‘Ardennes rollercoaster’, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, heavy rain alternated with drying patches. Starting from third on the grid, the trio skillfully navigated the challenges aboard the #37 BMW M 1000 RR, supported by excellent pit work from the team. The reward was second place and the team’s first podium of the season, following a fourth-place finish at the Le Mans (FRA) season opener.\n\nIlya Mikhalchik (UKR), Kenny Foray (FRA), and David Checa (ESP) once again shared riding duties on the BMW M 1000 RR for the ERC Endurance #6 team, finishing sixth. LRP Poland’s #90 BMW M 1000 RR took 28th place overall and 15th in the EWC class.\n\nIn the Superstock category, the #9 BMW M 1000 RR was untouchable.

In the new Production class, team Flying Buffs M3 Racing took fourth place.\n\nRound three of the 2025 FIM EWC, the eight-hour race at Suzuka, Japan, will be held on 3rd August.\n\nIsle of Man Tourist Trophy.\n\nThe BMW M 1000 RR once again confirmed its top-tier status in road racing at this year’s Isle of Man TT. The first 1000cc race, the Superbike TT, was held on Monday and ended with a BMW one-two. Davey Todd (GBR) of the 8Ten Racing team added another TT victory to his collection. His closest rival and runner-up after four laps of the Mountain Course was Michael Dunlop (GBR / MD Racing). The two Superstock TT races followed on Tuesday and Friday, with more podiums for the BMW riders: Todd claimed second place in both races, while Dunlop finished third twice.\n\nAnticipation was high for the event’s highlight, the prestigious Senior TT, scheduled to wrap up the event on Saturday. However, initial rain delays were followed by strong and shifting winds, and the organisers ultimately made the call to cancel the race on safety grounds.\n\nPeter Hickman (GBR / 8Ten Racing) had also travelled to the Isle of Man as a top contender on the BMW M 1000 RR, but suffered a heavy crash during Friday’s qualifying. He sustained injuries and was treated at Nobles Hospital but returned to the paddock the next day to support teammate Todd at the races.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Our riders, teams, and the BMW M 1000 RR faced some of the sport’s greatest challenges over the past few days – both in the FIM Endurance World Championship and at the Isle of Man – and they rose to the occasion brilliantly. At the Spa 8 Hours, they defied extremely difficult conditions, earning a fantastic second place for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and a Superstock win for Champion-MRP-Tecmas. The Isle of Man TT, the most demanding road race of all, also saw continued success for BMW – a superb one-two with Davey Todd and Michael Dunlop in the Superbike TT, followed by more podiums in the Superstock races. We were all eagerly awaiting the Senior TT, and while its cancellation due to high winds was disappointing, it was unquestionably the right decision. My thanks go to all the riders, teams, and the BMW Motorrad Motorsport crew who made these past days so successful. We also send our best wishes to Peter Hickman for a speedy recovery – we look forward to seeing Hicky back on his BMW M 1000 RR very soon!”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “As always, Spa was an incredibly intense event. This track often requires riding in wet conditions, and our riders had to perform at the highest level in both practice and the race. Notably, we set by far the fastest lap time in dry conditions, clearly demonstrating the potential of the BMW M 1000 RR. Our riders had great pace. Unfortunately, most of the race was wet with rapidly changing conditions. Tyre choices between slicks, intermediates, and wets were critical – and we always made the right call but in such a competitive field, finding the right pace remains extremely challenging. Congratulations to the winning Honda team – we’re very happy to have scored valuable points with second place. The Superstock victory for Champion-MRP-Tecmas was also a fantastic achievement. This was the first race for the team in this configuration, and though all are experienced, they had never formed a team before. In the Superstock class, the focus is on the base motorcycle, and it's fantastic that Jan Bühn, Tati Mercado, and our factory rider Hannes Soomer clinched the victory straight away with the BMW M 1000 RR. We also had strong results on the Isle of Man – a win and multiple podiums. Once again, the BMW M 1000 RR proved its strength. It’s a shame Peter Hickman was injured. He also had been showing great form until the crash. We wish him a speedy recovery.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was a hard race, especially with these weather conditions, it was not so easy but my teammates and the team did an awesome job, and I also tried my best on and off the track. I think we know where we still can improve but we are happy. It’s our first podium with our new tyres, and we need them especially in these conditions. We are happy that we came through and with P2 we set a good base for our goals in the championship. Now we already fully focus on Suzuka. Thanks to the entire team; I am really delighted that we finished on the podium.”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “At one point, it was really getting serious, there was a lot of water and aquaplaning, especially in the first section and on the back straight. I already said on Friday that it is going to be brutal and it was. We had all sorts of conditions. This second place is good and a strong result for us. We had a really strong pace in the dry, in the wet we were just missing something. Overall, it feels good to be back on the podium.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It’s a solid result. It was easy to make mistakes in those conditions. I think about the championship and even if a second place is not a win we are getting there step by step. Two more to go, and then we will try to get it at the Bol d’Or!”\n\nHannes Soomer, Champion-MRP-Tecmas: “It was my first time at Spa, and it took me two runs to remember where the track goes as it is so long and quite difficult. After some ups and downs, including a crash for Leandro in qualifying, the race itself was really smooth. The entire team did a faultless job, every rider did three stints and we all were on the pace. The whole team did a fantastic job and that was rewarded with this great victory.”\n\nDavey Todd, 8Ten Racing: “It has been a disappointing end to the TT this year. We finally got some nearly dry conditions but the wind was really bad which made it really hard out there. I am confident that the organisers made the right decision to cancel the Senior TT. That was the best thing to do for safety. We take the positives: I am the only Superbike winner at the TT this year and it makes me even more hungry to come back next year and win the Senior TT.”\n\nAll results from the FIM EWC 8-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps can be found here:\n\nAll result from the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races can be found here:"}

It was a milestone in the career of Nicolai von Dellingshausen: Last Sunday, the 32-year-old claimed his maiden tournament win on the DP World Tour at the Austrian Alpine Open. However, von Dellingshausen is not the only German who enjoyed a confidence-boosting result in Austria at the weekend: Marcel Schneider finished in a tie for second place, while Marcel Siem was tied in fifth. The trio is now hoping to back up this fine form at the next event near the Alps, when the BMW International Open takes place from 2nd to 6th June at Golfclub München Eichenried.\n\n“Like every year, I am really looking forward to the BMW International Open. A home tournament is always something special, particularly such an atmospheric one,” says von Dellingshausen. “My victory at the Austrian Alpine Open obviously gives me confidence and momentum, and I will do my very best to take advantage of that and give the best account of myself again in Munich.”\n\nFlying the flag for Germany alongside Siem, Schneider and von Dellingshausen at the 36th BMW International Open will be Yannik Paul, Alexander Knappe and Jannik De Bruyn. It has been confirmed of several months now that Martin Kaymer, the only German ever to win the tournament, will also tee off at the only DP World Tour event on German soil. He will be joined by Matti Schmid and Stephan Jäger, who primarily play on the PGA TOUR. “Eichenried lad” Jäger will be determined to do well when he returns to his home and the club, at which he learned to play golf. Schmid came within a whisker of his first PGA TOUR title at the end of May, missing out on victory at the Charles Schwab Challenge by just one shot. That result did, however, confirm that the man from Regensburg is currently on top form.\n\nA German win in Austria: Bernd Wiesberger and Matthias Schwab would love to turn last weekend’s events on their head and celebrate an Austrian victory in Germany at the BMW International Open. It would be a first in the long history of the tournament, although both players have come close to tasting victory in the past: Wiesberger was fourth in 2013, while Schwab finished third in 2019.\n\nTickets for the BMW International Open, at which fans will also be able to watch European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald (ENG) and former Masters champions Sergio García (ESP) and Patrick Reed (USA), are available at:"}

It’s fantastic that our BMW M Racing Academy member Nerea Martí secured her first win of the season with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO in Spain. There were also two class victories with our GT4 car in GT4 Australia. And in the GT World Challenge Asia, Team KRC’s impressive streak continues with an overall podium and a class victory. Congratulations to everyone involved!\"\n\nGT World Challenge Asia: Overall podium and class victory for Team KRC.Team KRC and drivers Ruan Cun Fan (CHN) and Maxime Oosten (NED) continue to dominate the Sil-Am class of the GT World Challenge Asia powered by AWS. At the race weekend on Thailand's Chang International Circuit, the duo added more successes to their already impressive season record. After finishing second in class in the first race, the #89 BMW M4 GT3 EVO triumphed in the Sil-Am category in the second race and came within just 0.350 seconds of an overall victory. Ruan Cun Fan and Oosten celebrated second place overall on the podium. In the Sil-Am driver standings, the pair extended their already commanding lead.

Martí finished the second race as the closing driver in second place. \"I am very happy about the win at Jarama,\" said Martí. \"Second place in the second race also confirms that our joint work with the BMW team since Portimão has paid off. We tried many different things and settings, and they worked. The BMW M4 GT4 EVO was very easy and comfortable to drive. We really enjoyed the weekend.

Amid the turmoil, Cody Burcher and Tim Leahey (both AUS) in the #22 BMW M4 GT4 from Ashley Seward Motorsport kept their composure and celebrated second place overall – equivalent to a victory in the Silver class. In the second race, the duo again performed well, finishing fifth overall and fourth in the Silver category, making them the best BMW crew. However, the most reason to celebrate went to Jacob Lawrence. The Australian driver won the Am category as seventh overall in his #32 BMW M4 GT4 from Randall Racing."}

With the introduction of pioneering SAP applications, the BMW Group is making significant progress in digitalization. The successful projects in production logistics and finance mark important milestones in the Group-wide rollout of a new, cloud-based IT architecture. Developed as greenfield projects, these solutions were created from scratch and are now being gradually rolled out worldwide.\n\n\"With the next stage of digitalization in production logistics and finance – enabled by consistent, unified data structures and standard process templates – we have significantly advanced the AI enablement of the BMW Group,\" explains Alexander Buresch, CIO and Senior Vice President of BMW Group IT. \"As part of our partnership with SAP, we have transferred key corporate processes to a service-oriented, cloud-based platform, achieving a new level of efficiency, quality, and automation.\"\n\nGlobal Digitalization of Production Logistics\n\nSo far, in addition to the MINI plant in Oxford, the high-volume plant in Regensburg has been successfully converted to digital production logistics. By the end of the year, the Munich headquarters and the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, will follow. The latter will begin producing the fully electric BMW iX3 – the first model of the Neue Klasse – by year-end.\n\nThe so-called “Parts Process Chain” enables digital control of all in-house produced components and parts sourced from external suppliers, and is being gradually introduced at all production sites worldwide as part of the BMW iFactory. Optimized collaboration with suppliers, as well as efficient storage and provision, ensures stable operations and flexible control of the entire production process.\n\n\"The global digitalization of our production logistics significantly increases transparency and standardization, allowing us to respond more quickly to changes in demand or supply shortages,\" explains Michael Nikolaides, Head of Production Network and Logistics at the BMW Group. \"In addition to vehicle plants, we will also integrate new assembly sites for sixth-generation high-voltage batteries to support the stable ramp-up of electromobility.\"\n\nNew Financial Solution Improves Data Transparency and Process Efficiency\n\nThe financial system \"Group Finance BackBone\" (GFBB) features a completely new data model that standardizes previously heterogeneously structured financial information. This leads to improved data comparability and higher granularity, enabling detailed analyses and real-time business management. \"We call it ‘data at your fingertips,’ as time-consuming manual evaluations and complex reconciliations are now a thing of the past,\" explains Jonathan Townend, Head of Group Reporting and Taxes at the BMW Group.\n\nMoreover, GFBB ensures comprehensive standardization and harmonization of financial processes across the Group. It takes into account both central and local requirements and significantly increases the degree of automation in finance. For the organization, this means easier cross-functional collaboration and a notable reduction in complexity. Following the successful go-live of BMW AG, BMW Bank, and the production plants in Oxford and Debrecen, the global rollout of GFBB is now continuing step by step.\n\nStrategic Partnership with SAP\n\nAs part of the “RISE with SAP” initiative, the BMW Group launched a comprehensive transformation process back in 2023. The goal is to migrate existing SAP systems to a modern, cloud-based architecture that also facilitates greater use of AI. The intelligent combination of SAP standards and BMW Cloud Services ensures rapid integration of innovations, maximum flexibility, and global scalability. Additionally, the BMW Group is actively involved in the further development of the SAP S/4HANA standard and drives it forward through co-innovation efforts."}

The BMW M Motorsport teams impressed once again during the second race weekend of the Endurance Cup in the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS at Monza (ITA) with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. At the Temple of Speed, BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER), alongside Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) and Ben Tuck (GBR), triumphed in the Gold Cup. Charles Weerts (BEL) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), together with Ugo de Wilde (BEL) for Team WRT, finished fourth in the Pro Cup, maintaining their overall lead in both the drivers' and team standings.\n\nKlingmann, Al Faisal Al Zubair, and Tuck started the three-hour Monza race from seventh place in the Gold Cup. A strong strategy brought the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO into the lead after about an hour and a half, a position the trio never relinquished. Klingmann secured fourth place overall and a commanding class victory – a reason to celebrate once again after his overall win last year. For AlManar Racing by WRT, this marked their second podium finish in as many Endurance Cup races; the trio finished third in the Le Castellet (FRA) season opener\n\nRight behind them, Weerts, van der Linde, and de Wilde fought their way from eleventh on the grid to fifth overall despite two five-second time penalties. With fourth place in the Pro Cup, the trio also collected important points for the overall standings. In addition to the drivers' standings for Weerts and van der Linde, Team WRT, which won the season opener at Le Castellet, also defended its lead in the team standings.\n\nROWE Racing, on the other hand, experienced an unfortunate Sunday in Lombardy as a full course yellow immediately after their pit stop, during which the team also lost time due to being held up in the crowded pit lane, set Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) back. After a collision in the fiercely contested midfield, Krohn had to retire the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO due to damage.\n\nIn the Silver Cup, Century Motorsport and Team WRT delivered a thrilling battle for the class victory in the final stages at Monza. In the internal BMW M Motorsport duel, Jarrod Waberski (RSA), William Moore (GBR), and Mex Jansen (NED) in the #42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO ultimately came out on top.

After qualifying, it looked like it would be a challenging Sunday, but over the race distance, our teams demonstrated excellent strategic skills. With two class wins and the defense of the overall lead, we can be very satisfied. Many thanks to everyone involved for their outstanding efforts! Now we will give it our all together to prepare optimally for the season highlight in June at Spa-Francorchamps. I am confident that ROWE Racing will also play a leading role again after their unfortunate race at Monza.\"\n\nUgo de Wilde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 4th place Pro Cup): \"I think we achieved the maximum possible for us today with a trouble-free race. The goal was to score as many points as possible for the overall standings, and we succeeded. But both we as a team and I personally still have room for improvement. That’s good news as we look ahead to the season highlight at Spa-Francorchamps.\"\n\nJens Klingmann (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1st place Gold Cup): \"First place in the Gold Cup is another fantastic result here at Monza after our overall win last year. I can only say: 'Teamwork makes the dream work!' At the start, we didn’t think we had the pace to win. But the strategy, the pit stops, the driver changes – all of that made the difference once again. Now we head into the big race at Spa-Francorchamps well-prepared and full of anticipation.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, DNF): \"The accident involving Jesse that led to our retirement was very unfortunate, but these things can happen. Before that, I actually had a great start but got boxed in at the first chicane and couldn’t capitalise on it. During our first pit stop, we got stuck again in the very crowded pit lane and lost a few positions. Sometimes you just have races like this. Now we focus on the coming weeks with the most important races of the year.\"\n\nMex Jansen (#42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Century Motorsport, 1st place Silver Cup): \"I think that was the most intense race of my career. It was incredibly hot in the car, but I’m glad I could bring the winner’s trophy home for the team. Many thanks to Century Motorsport and my co-drivers. A fantastic day!\""}

In the fifth race of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season in Detroit (USA), BMW M Team RLL was unable to replicate the successes of previous events. With fifth and seventh places on the tight street circuit, the BMW M Hybrid V8s missed the podium in a sprint race for the first time. In qualifying, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) secured third and fourth on the grid, ending Vanthoor's impressive streak of four consecutive pole positions.\n\nIn the 100-minute race, filled with battles and contact, both cars struggled to move forward in the tight field. Van der Linde handed over the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 to Marco Wittmann (GER), while Vanthoor passed the #24 car to Philipp Eng (AUT). After a later pit stop, Eng returned to the track ahead of Wittmann and held his position ahead of his teammate until the end. Wittmann crossed the finish line in sixth but lost a position due to a post-race penalty for overtaking under yellow flags.\n\nIn the GTD PRO class, both Paul Miller Racing crews delivered a strong qualifying performance, starting from third and fourth. However, the 100-minute race proved disappointing. The #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO driven by Madison Snow and Neil Verhagen (both USA) suffered technical issues, causing it to lose several laps and ultimately finish 11th in class. The #48 car of Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) fought for a podium spot for a long time, but after a collision and a subsequent drive-through penalty, Hesse dropped to seventh in class.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"Unfortunately, the race in Detroit did not go as we had hoped. After qualifying, things looked promising with third and fourth places in both classes, but unfortunately, we were unable to maintain those positions in a tough race with many contacts. In the GTP class, our streaks of four pole positions and two consecutive podiums have come to an end, but we are determined to start new streaks at the next race at Watkins Glen. Paul Miller Racing needs to quickly put this disappointing race behind them. We will carefully analyse what caused the issue with the #1 car.\"\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 5th place): \"That was a tough race. On my part, I didn’t get a good start and lost two positions. Over the course of the race, we didn’t optimise our strategy. We need to keep working on this and understand why others are doing a better job in this area. We’ll come back fighting next time.\"\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 7th place): \"What started with a great qualifying and third place unfortunately ended with relatively few points in the race. I was very happy with my lap in qualifying. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to capitalise on the good starting position in the race. That’s something we absolutely need to improve on. I’m confident that we’ll manage to do so in Watkins Glen. The BMW M Hybrid V8 has performed well there in the past, and I hope we can secure our first podium of the season.\""}

At the beginning of the year, BMW M Motorsport launched the BMW M Racing Academy, a new customer sport support programme for four drivers from the GT4-category. The \"Class of 2025,\" consisting of Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP), Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER), has experienced an eventful first half of the year. The participants completed many valuable test kilometres in the BMW M2 Racing, trained at Formula Medicine, and received exclusive and detailed insights during BMW M Motorsport works engagements.\n\nAt the start of the programme, participants travelled to Formula Medicine in Viareggio (ITA), where they worked on their mental and physical fitness under the professional guidance of Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his globally renowned team.\n\nDuring various test drives with the BMW M2 Racing at Miramas (FRA) and Varano (ITA), the \"Class of 2025\" did not just accumulate many kilometres over the past months. Side by side with BMW M works drivers, participants contributed important development work for the new entry-level model which will be used by many private customer teams on the racetrack starting in 2026. They learned about the professional processes underlying the market launch of a new vehicle at a major manufacturer like BMW.\n\nMartí and Besler gained extensive insights into BMW M Motorsport's works engagements during the FIA WEC race weekend at Imola (ITA). They exchanged ideas with BMW M Motorsport director Andreas Roos and BMW M works drivers, received a garage tour, and participated in a debrief. Million attended the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship race weekend at Laguna Seca (USA), observing the teams and drivers from the LMDh and GT3 programmes.\n\nThe BMW M Racing Academy is enriched by a quartet of mentors who fully support participants with advice, tips, and analyses. BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) serves as the main contact for the four young talents. He is supported by his works driver colleagues Max Hesse (GER) and Robby Foley (USA). All three accompany the programme closely and support participants with their expertise on and off the track. Dirk Adorf (GER) also contributes his extensive experience from previous talent support programmes. This support includes visits to \"Class of 2025\" race events in the second half of the year, providing insights into works programmes and advising them on their own GT4 customer sport engagements.\n\nBesler, Martí, Tröger, and Million prevailed against several other drivers from the GT4-category in a comprehensive selection process in Munich (GER) at the end of last year.\n\nStatements on the BMW M Racing Academy.\n\nBjörn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: \"I am very pleased that we can offer a support programme again this season. Supporting young talents from customer racing is very important to BMW M Motorsport and me personally. It's great to see how well our 'Class of 2025' has developed in the first months and how much they appreciate our efforts to advance their development as drivers through involvement in works engagements. What they learn with us is intended to elevate them to a higher level for their current and future racing engagements. It was also very positive for us that the drivers were available for our BMW M2 Racing tests. All parties involved have benefitted enormously from that. Now I look forward to the second half of the year with the BMW M Racing Academy.\"\n\nJens Klingmann, BMW M Motorsport Works Driver: \"We have had an exciting and thrilling first half-year, experiencing many things together in a short time. With the development days in the BMW M2 Racing, we created a special added value. We were able to involve our participants everywhere and offer them a behind-the-scenes look at how development tests are conducted and what is important in vehicle development. They received a lot of driving time in this project and made a very valuable contribution, which was very important for their development. Particularly significant is the experience of providing feedback to engineers and articulating the driving experience to create added value for everyone involved in the project - and to improve the car. We mentors are very glad to be involved, sharing our expertise on and off the track. We are always available to participants with tips, experiences, and advice. Overall, we have seen significant improvements on and off the track. I can draw a very positive balance from the first half-year and look forward to the second half.\"\n\nBerkay Besler, BMW M Racing Academy Participant: “The programme has been great so far. Up until now we have experienced a lot of things, most importantly what BMW M Motorsport expects from us. Being one of the fastest on track is really important but also it is important how we behave off the track and represent the brand. Being a part of the BMW M Racing Academy is a great opportunity for us to learn as much as possible from all the mentors. We have spent a lot of time with them and they are all trying to help us and want us to learn as much as possible to be a better race car driver. I am really happy for that and really appreciate that. We have so many more things to do in our programme so we are all looking forward and can’t wait to be back.“\n\nNerea Martí, BMW M Racing Academy Participant: \"The experience so far has been incredible. From day one, I have learned so much - not only on the track but also in terms of teamwork and approaching motorsport in a more professional way. We had intense physical and mental tests that showed me where I can improve and that small changes in training or mindset can make a huge difference. One of the most valuable parts of the programme were the on-track test sessions with the BMW M2 Racing. It was special to learn how to work together as a team to analyse performance and develop the car. The mentors play a big role in this. They share their experience with us and help us understand how to give clear, structured feedback and communicate during a debrief. I really appreciate how open and honest they are with us.\"\n\nMatt Million, BMW M Racing Academy Participant: \"I am very happy that the opportunity arose to be part of such a programme. The ties to the brand have helped me feel even more integrated in the processes of BMW M Motorsport. I have been able to take in the level of professionalism at which BMW M Motorsport, the employees, and the drivers work and have benefitted from it in all areas. Working with BMW M Motorsport engineers during the BMW M2 Racing test drive was super valuable. It has significantly improved my ability to analyse or write reports; It has helped me immensely in terms of communication. The behind-the-scenes look at Laguna Seca gave me a better insight into how BMW M Motorsport works on-site. The mentors are incredibly helpful. They have given me fantastic input on what their roles look like - not only within their teams but also as BMW M works drivers. I plan to spend even more time with them this year.\"\n\nNiels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy Participant: \"I have been able to gather a lot of impressions about what the work of a works driver entails. For example, how important it is to provide engineers with good feedback to improve or develop the car. At Formula Medicine, I gained many important insights that a works driver receives in his work. I was able to focus on where my weaknesses are, but also where my strengths lie. I can now work on that further. As a driver, I am getting faster because the BMW M Racing Academy gives me the opportunity to spend a lot of time in the car and test. A big part is the mentors, who work very well with us and whom we can contact at any time. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy is a great opportunity to develop my career and achieve success together with BMW M Motorsport.\""}

On 7 June, the “Belle Macchine. Italian Automotive Design at BMW” exhibition will open its doors at the BMW Museum. With its famed sense for timeless aesthetics, Italy has set standards in fashion, interior and product design for as long as anyone can remember. And Italian designers have also left an enduring mark on the automotive world. This exhibition explores the influence of Italian design at BMW and provides a fascinating retrospective on the evolution of coachbuilding and body design over the past few decades.\n\nBMW has drawn inspiration from Italian coachbuilding culture since as far back as the 1930s. Collaborations with renowned designers such as Giorgetto Giugiaro, Giovanni Michelotti and Marcello Gandini produced icons that have made a lasting impression on the brand. “BMW has harnessed Italian influences to create automotive design that blends class and elegance with modern forms and functionality. The combination of Italian design and German engineering excellence was a key driver of BMW’s growth into a premium manufacturer,” explain curators Anna Schleypen and Klaus-Anton Altenbuchner. The exhibition illustrates this development with a variety of design sketches from the BMW Design Archive, a selection of exhibits and 23 historic vehicles, and provides a captivating insight into the design history of BMW.\n\nA tour of the exhibition“Belle Macchine. Italian Automotive Design at BMW” extends over five platforms and ramps within the BMW Museum’s iconic “Bowl”. It starts with a general introduction into the world of Italian design, citing examples of the country’s endeavours in the fields of fashion and product design. The impact of noted Italian studios on the design of bodies for BMW vehicles occupies much of the exhibition space. For example, the BMW Garmisch concept car penned by Marcello Gandini represents the essence of Italian style and played a major role in the design of the original BMW 3 Series and 5 Series of the 1970s. As is clear from the numerous production cars on display, such as the popular BMW 1800 TI/SA, the stylistic influence of Italian designers was leveraged to successful effect by a large number of models. BMW’s acquisition of fellow carmaker Glas is also brought under the spotlight with a three-strong line-up including the BMW 3000 V8, affectionately known as the “Glaserati”. The exhibition continues with a showcase of perfectly formed one-offs like the BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupé, BMW 2800 GTS Frua and BMW Nazca M12 designed by Fabrizio Giugiaro. These models were commissioned by the company to serve as sources of creative inspiration or put forward by the Italian designers themselves to ensure they were part of the conversation when BMW was scouting for partners.\n\nOn the ramps between the platforms, visitors are taken on a visual road-trip with stop-offs including the legendary Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como – a beauty contest for historic vehicles of unparalleled tradition. The design drawings on show here provide further evidence of the artistic signature of Italian designers. The exhibition finishes on a high with a model of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse – the modern successor to the Italian-flavoured original Neue Klasse of yesteryear – and special study vehicles such as the BMW M1 Hommage. These cars see BMW recognising the achievements of the Italian designers of the time and re-interpreting its own design history as a source of inspiration for its latest creations.\n\nIn another visual highlight, the exhibition area is enveloped in a 360-degree display – projected onto the walls of the “Bowl” – that showcases the work of Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, who studied for a time in Munich."}

Outstanding agility, a significant increase in power output, supreme dynamics and particularly sporty design characteristics make driving the latest exclusive special-edition model from BMW M ...", "tags": ["G87", "G87 CS", "M2 CS", "BMW M Cars"], "url": "https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0450299EN/the-new-bmw-m2-cs", "content": "The new version of this special edition offers the ultimate in driving pleasure – both as a track tool and in day-to-day use. Like the BMW M2 Racing, which is based on the chassis from the latest-generation M2, the BMW M2 CS will be manufactured at BMW Group Plant San Luis Potosí in Mexico. As has become familiar with other special-edition models from BMW M GmbH, the BMW M2 CS will be produced in limited numbers. The key sales markets are the USA, Germany and China. The market launch will begin in late summer 2025. The BMW M2 CS will be priced at € 115,000 in Germany.\n\nNoticeable weight reduction thanks to intelligent lightweight design\n\nBMW M GmbH has reduced the weight of the special edition by roughly 30 kilograms compared to the standard M2. This has been achieved through modifications including judicious use of lightweight design techniques. For example, the BMW M2 CS features a multitude of exterior and interior components made from carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). And it will be fitted as standard with forged M light-alloy wheels. As a result, the CS will be the lightest BMW M2 so far in the current generation.\n\nUpgraded six-cylinder in-line engine with significant increase in power output and torque\n\nFor the BMW M2 CS, BMW M GmbH has opted for an upgraded version of the 3.0-litre, six-cylinder in-line engine found in the standard M2. This intensifies the performance experience in the special edition, particularly in highly dynamic driving situations. It further sharpens the engine’s unmistakable power characteristics and perfectly accentuates the linear power delivery – sustained into the higher reaches of the rev range – familiar from M models. Compared to the BMW M2 with standard eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic, maximum torque has been raised by 50 Nm (37 lb-ft) to 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) and is available across a broad rev range – between 2,650 and 5,730 rpm. The engine produces its maximum power output of 390 kW/530 hp at 6,250 rpm, with the engine speed topping out at 7,200 rpm. In order to allow extremely rapid reactions to the driver’s requests for acceleration and to make the improved performance characteristics of the engine a particularly intense experience, the accelerator mapping and response have been optimised in all the drive modes, which are selectable via the M Setup menu.\n\nRacing expertise delivers inspiring performance\n\nWith its improved peak performance, the new BMW M2 CS is consolidating its claim to top spot in the compact high-performance segment. This performance specification is achieved by modifying the engine management and provides further proof of the outstanding potential of the six-cylinder in-line engine developed by BMW M GmbH, which also serves as the basis for the power unit used in the BMW M4 GT3 EVO racing car. The engine’s M TwinPower Turbo technology comprises a pair of mono-scroll turbochargers, which each supply three cylinders with compressed air, an indirect intercooler supplied by a low-temperature circuit, and an electronically controlled wastegate. The technology package also includes High Precision Injection, which operates with maximum pressure of 350 bar, VALVETRONIC variable valve timing and Double-VANOS fully variable camshaft timing. The engine also has an array of details borrowed directly from racing car design, including its lightning-fast response, appetite for revs and high-performance capability in track use. These details include an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged crankshaft with lightweight design, cylinder bores with a wire-arc sprayed iron coating and a 3D-printed core for the cylinder head.\n\nThe M-specific cooling system ensures the powertrain components maintain an optimal operating temperature even under heavy loads and the oil circuit is designed to handle extreme dynamic driving situations. A map-controlled oil pump ensures reliable oil supply even under extreme acceleration.\n\nThe engine sends its drive power through an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic as standard. The Drivelogic button integrated into the selector lever makes it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings. Both the selector lever in the latest M design and the gearshift paddles on the steering wheel enable sequential interventions in the gear selection process at any time.\n\nBMW M2 CS breaks the four-second barrier\n\nA model-specific engine mounting with a higher spring rate makes for a particularly rigid connection of the drive unit to the structure of the BMW M2 CS. The extremely direct transmission of power to the drivetrain optimises response. Thanks to the lightning-fast power delivery, in combination with the increased engine power and the car’s lighter weight, the BMW M2 CS is able to break the four-second barrier for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph). It’s time of 3.8 seconds is 0.2 seconds faster than for the standard M2. The figure calculated using the “1-foot rollout” method** is 3.5 seconds. The increase in power also enhances acceleration from rest to 200 km/h (124 mph). The time required here is reduced by 1.2 seconds to 11.7 seconds – or 11.4 seconds according to the “1‑foot rollout” method**. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 3.4 seconds. The top speed of the special-edition model, which comes with the M Driver’s Package as standard, is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph). The dynamic power delivery is backed by an emotionally rich engine note conjured by the M-specific exhaust system with electrically controlled flaps and the four exhaust pipes typical of M, which come in matt black on the BMW M2 CS. For those wishing to retrofit their car, the M Performance silencer system with carbon and titanium tailpipe trims developed specifically for CS models is available for the first time in the range of M Performance Parts for the BMW M2 CS. The lightweight valve exhaust system with titanium mufflers generates a racing-car sound guaranteed to stir the emotions. The Active Sound Design helps to convey the engine’s soundtrack authentically inside the cabin, with the intensity raised another notch when SPORT or SPORT PLUS mode is selected using the Driving Experience Control switch.\n\nChassis and brakes optimised for increased performance\n\nThe chassis technology and braking system in the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the improved performance characteristics of the engine and the specific weight balance of the special edition. The chassis has been lowered by eight millimetres and adapted specially for the car with bespoke tuning for its springs, dampers and chassis control systems. These modifications improve driving dynamics significantly in all scenarios – including under extremely hard driving. Indeed, the settings for the Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and M Dynamic Mode have been optimised precisely to meet the demands of driving on the race track. The standard adaptive M chassis has been given a carefully adapted model-specific setup, as have the M Servotronic steering, M Sport differential and the integrated braking system. An M Compound braking system with red brake callipers, which comes as standard, provides powerful retardation. An M Carbon ceramic brake system with red brake callipers is available as an option. Standard equipment also includes CS-exclusive forged M light-alloy wheels with a double-spoke design and matt Gold Bronze finish. They measure 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear axle and are fitted as standard with track tyres, the dimensions of which are 275/35 ZR19 at the front and 285/30 ZR20 at the rear. An ultra-track tyre and a standard sport tyre (a no-cost option) in the same dimensions are available on request.\n\nExterior features many carbon components and exclusive details\n\nThe punchy exterior of the BMW M2 CS is shaped by many components made of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and other exclusive details. As well as the M exterior mirror caps familiar from the BMW M2, the M Carbon roof – which comes as standard on the special-edition model – and CS-specific rear diffusor are also made from eye-catching exposed carbon fibre. A front splitter in matt black and an exclusive black BMW M kidney grille with optimised air inlets complete the sporty and dynamic look. The lightweight CFRP boot lid with integrated ducktail is a real head-turner. The “M2 CS” logo on the rear has a red outline. Four colours are available for the exterior finish of the new BMW M2 CS: Sapphire Black metallic, BMW Individual Velvet Blue metallic, M Brooklyn Grey metallic and M Portimao Blue metallic. Adaptive LED Headlights with BMW Selective Beam non-dazzling High Beam Assistant and M lights Shadowline with dark inlays are also standard.\n\nCarbon and racing flair continue inside\n\nThe interior of the new BMW M2 CS combines an exclusive look with the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara and innovative lightweight design. For example, the centre console is made of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The driver and passenger take their places in weight-optimised, heated M Carbon bucket seats with a wide range of electrically controlled settings and an illuminated “CS” logo. The integrated head restraints are removable and, thanks to the option of integrating multi-point harnesses, improve the car’s track readiness. The surfaces of the seats are finished in Merino leather.\n\nWith a flat-bottomed rim, gearshift paddles, a red centre marker at 12 o’clock and two M buttons for selecting individually configured vehicle setups, the standard M Alcantara steering wheel – which is available in a heated version as an option and features a three-spoke design – brings authentic racing flair to the cockpit. The trim elements in the instrument panel and centre console come in M Carbon Fibre. Additional specific details include the red “CS” logo on the centre console, the M seatbelts and the entry door sill plates, which are black with an “M2 CS” logo and red outline for the first time. Now illuminated with the “CS” logo, the door trim panels certainly grab the attention. The colour used here can be set individually, likewise the standard ambient lighting. When switched off, a carbon structure is visible. Rounding off the sporty interior is the M Anthracite headlining.\n\nBMW Operating System 8.5, digital control for the climate functions\n\nStandard equipment in the new BMW M2 CS also includes two-zone automatic climate control, comfort access, the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System and BMW Live Cockpit Professional, including the BMW Maps navigation system. As well as the BMW Head-Up Display, it also includes Augmented View on the control display. The standard smartphone integration allows the use of Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. The M-specific displays on the BMW Curved Display and BMW Head-Up Display add to the progressive sports car flair in the cockpit. The fully-digital display grouping consists of a 12.3-inch information display and a 14.9-inch control display. These serve as a platform for the BMW iDrive control and operation system, based on BMW Operating System 8.5, which can also be used to digitally operate the climate control functions. In the BMW M2 CS, temperature and ventilation settings, heated seats and the heated steering wheel (if specified) can be controlled either by touch using a special menu option in the lower area of the control display or by voice command with the help of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant.\n\nM-specific operating concept enables direct access for an extensive range of functions\n\nThe special-edition model carries over the cutting-edge operating concept for setup customisation from the BMW M2. At the heart is the Setup button on the centre console. This provides direct access to the settings options for the engine, standard adaptive M suspension, M Servotronic steering, integrated braking system working in conjunction with the M Compound brakes, and the M Traction Control function, which allows drivers to set individual intervention thresholds for wheel slip limitation. M Drive Professional makes an ideal companion for journeys fuelled by extra adrenaline. The M mode TRACK and the ten-stage M Traction Control allow customised handling characteristics. The M Drift Analyser shows the angle and duration of drifts executed by the driver, while the M Laptimer is ideal for those striving for the perfect lap.\n\nSemi-automated driving and parking systems fitted as standard include front collision warning, Cruise Control with brake function, Speed Limit Info function with no-overtaking indicator, Lane Departure Warning, and the Parking Assistant with Reversing Assistant. Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function and the Driving Assistant can be added as optional equipment.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: Fuel consumption and emissions figures: Fuel consumption, combined: 10.0 l/100 km [28.3 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions, combined: 226 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G."}

The BMW M2 Racing performed excellently under typically chaotic Eifel conditions and proved that it delivers everything we expect from our new entry-level race car. Many thanks to the team at FK Performance Motorsport, the drivers, and the BMW M Motorsport engineers for this strong and professional performance. With a total of 13 class victories, our teams have demonstrated that they are capable of winning with various BMW M Motorsport race cars – and will certainly play a leading role in the 24-hour race. That only increases my anticipation for the season highlight. Congratulations also to BMW Italia Ceccato Racing and Century Motorsport on their successes in the Italian GT and British GT. The ‘Crazy Month of June’ with three major 24-hour races in a row – along with many other customer racing highlights – can come!”\n\n24h Nürburgring Qualifiers: Baptism by rain for the BMW M2 Racing.\n\nThe BMW M2 Racing experienced the full toughness of the “Green Hell” last weekend at the 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers, passing its ultimate test ahead of the endurance classic in June with flying colors. The first of two four-hour races on Saturday evening in particular, held in pouring rain, put the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car, the FK Performance Motorsport team, and the three drivers – BMW M works drivers Ugo de Wilde and Charles Weerts (both BEL), along with motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER) – to the test. The BMW M2 Racing ran flawlessly however, and crossed the finish line second in its SP3T class. In Sunday’s race, the car emerged largely unscathed from an unavoidable collision and secured third place in class.\n\n“The BMW M2 Racing completed both races without any technical problems,” said Weerts. “It’s a lot of fun to drive. It has a lot of mechanical grip, which allows for quite high cornering speeds. Even under Saturday’s extreme conditions with heavy rain, the car gave us a good feeling and performed strongly. On Sunday I was hit pretty hard by another competitor, but there was hardly any damage to the car, and we were able to finish the weekend successfully and gain a lot of insights.” De Wilde added: “It was my first time with the BMW M2 Racing on the Nordschleife – and it was a fantastic experience. I earned my permit with the BMW M240i Racing, and the differences to the new car are enormous. The BMW M2 Racing is easier to drive, the suspension and brakes are significantly improved. I felt very comfortable. For me personally, it was important to get to know the Nordschleife better – especially under crazy conditions. After this weekend, I understand why it’s called the ‘Green Hell’. Still, I’m really looking forward to the 24-hour race.”\n\nThe 24h Nürburgring Qualifiers were generally a great success for the BMW M Motorsport teams. With six class wins on Saturday and seven on Sunday, the teams had an impressive dress rehearsal for June’s season highlight. The new BMW M4 GT4 EVO dominated the SP8T class with quadruple victories on both days. First place on each occasion went to FK Performance Motorsport. A BMW M4 GT4 EVO also competed in the AT3 class, where the Giti Tire Motorsport by WS Racing team won both races. No BMW M4 GT3 EVO participated in the top SP9 class. ROWE Racing will return to action at the 24-hour race.\n\nItalian GT Championship: BMW Italia Ceccato Racing starts the Sprint season with a victory.\n\nBMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN), along with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing, made a strong start to the Sprint season of the Italian GT Championship at Vallelunga (ITA). Klingmann and the team led by Roberto Ravaglia (ITA) are defending champions, and Krohn has now rejoined as a full-time driver for the sprint races. In the first race on Saturday, the duo took victory in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Due to regulations, they had to serve pit stop penalties in Sunday’s race but still managed seventh overall and fifth in the GT3 Pro class.\n\n“Vallelunga was a very strong weekend for us,” said Klingmann. “With Saturday’s win, we’ve started our title defense mission for the third year in a row. That gave us and the team a lot of confidence that we’re competitive and can fight for the title again. On Sunday, we tried to make the most of the pit stop penalties, which are based on Saturday’s results, and to limit the damage. At the next sprint race at Mugello, we’ll be penalty-free again and ready to go all out. Our mission this year is clear: we want to defend the title. I’m very happy to have made a strong statement with Roberto Ravaglia’s team and my teammate Jesse.”\n\n“I’m very happy to be back with BMW Italia Ceccato Racing in the Italian GT Championship, and it was great to start the season with a win,” said Krohn. “I’m here to help the team win a third title, and I’ll do everything I can to make that happen. I’m also thrilled to be racing with Jens again. He was one of my first teammates when I joined BMW M Motorsport eleven years ago.”\n\nTheir teammates William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) also started the Sprint season successfully in the #2 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. On Saturday, they finished third overall and took victory in the GT3 Pro-Am class. On Sunday, however, the duo retired early.\n\nBritish GT Championship: Century Motorsport wins with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO at Oulton Park.\n\nFans witnessed two dramatic races in the British GT Championship on Monday at Oulton Park (GBR). Branden Templeton and Chris Salkeld (both GBR) claimed their first win of the season in the #14 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Century Motorsport after previously scoring two second-place finishes. They won the GT4 Silver class in the first race and took third overall among the GT4 cars. In the second race, which saw some rain-related chaos, they finished second in their class and returned to the podium.\n\nThings took a dramatic turn on Monday for their teammates Ravi Ramyead and Charlie Robertson (both GBR) in the #71 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. After a win and a second-place finish earlier in the season, they arrived at Oulton Park as GT4 class leaders. In the first race, Ramyead built a solid lead in the GT4 field – but then suffered a heavy crash into the barriers. The good news was that Ramyead was uninjured. Unfortunately, the #71 was too badly damaged to compete in the second race of the day.\n\nIn the GT4 drivers’ standings of the British GT Championship, Ramyead and Robertson now sit in second place after four races, directly followed by Templeton/Salkeld in third."}

All plants worldwide are enabled for electromobility.”\n\nMunich. The three-millionth electrified vehicle rolled off the assembly line today at the BMW Group’s main plant in Munich – a BMW 330e* Touring in Portimao Blue, destined for the UK market. In 2024, one in four vehicles sold by the company was already either fully electric or a plug-in hybrid. At BMW Group plants, vehicles with electrified drive trains and internal combustion engines are produced alongside one another on the same production line.\n\n“With its highly flexible production, the BMW Group is able to respond to customer requirements in line with market trends and demand,” explains Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management responsible for Production. “All plants in our global production network are enabled for electromobility, paving the way for continued growth in this segment.”\n\nStart of BEV series production with BMW i3 in Leipzig in 2013\n\nThe company launched series production of fully electric vehicles with the BMW i3, back in 2013. The electric city car was manufactured for nearly ten years at Plant Leipzig, alongside the BMW Group’s first plug-in hybrid, the BMW i8. At that time, due to its unique vehicle architecture, the BMW i3 was still being built in Leipzig in a dedicated area for electric cars, in parallel with production of vehicles with conventional drive trains.\n\nSince then, the BMW Group has integrated electric cars into production at all its plants worldwide. Many of the plants initially assembled plug-in hybrid models on a single line, mixed in with their diesel and petrol counterparts, on a flexible basis. Electromobility accounts for a steadily growing share of production volumes, surpassing 25 percent in 2024, with around three-quarters of those vehicles fully electric. A total of one and a half million BEVs from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands have already been delivered.\n\nGlobal production network enabled for e-mobility\n\nWith the start of MINI Cooper SE production in Oxford in 2019, the BEV range was extended to the BMW Group’s second brand. The rollout continued from 2020 with the latest generation of e-drives. The BMW iX3 was built in China, while the BMW iX and i4 ramped up in Dingolfing and Munich in 2021. Within a year, all BMW Group plants in Germany had been enabled for production of fully electric vehicles. The company remains committed to systematically integrating electrified vehicles into existing production.\n\nIn China, electrification has already been introduced at all plant sites. In the US, Plant Spartanburg is preparing for production of fully electric vehicles from 2026, while Plant San Luis Potosí in Mexico will add BEV models for the Neue Klasse to its production portfolio in 2027. Both facilities already produce plug-in hybrid models. The plant in Rosslyn, South Africa, has been manufacturing plug-in hybrids since 2024. The BMW Group’s sites for local production in Brazil, India and Thailand also already build electrified vehicles.\n\nCompetence Centre for E-Drive Production\n\nProduction of electric powertrain components is expanding beyond Germany. Since the launch of the BMW i3, battery modules, high-voltage batteries and electric motors have been produced in Dingolfing. As part of the electrification of the production network, the Competence Centre for E-Drive Production was established at the site. By 2022, it had already reached an annual capacity of over 500,000 e-drives. Other locations gradually ramped up capacity to support the rapid growth in e-mobility. As a result, alongside Dingolfing, fifth-generation high-voltage batteries are now also assembled and installed in vehicles in Regensburg, Leipzig and Spartanburg. The expertise gained since then is now being applied to the sixth generation of e-drives, which will be introduced towards the end of this year with the NEUE KLASSE at the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW 330e xDrive Touring: Energy consumption, combined: 24,4 kWh/100 km and 1,2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions, combined: 26 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class(es): with discharged battery G; weighted, combined B; fuel consumption with discharged battery: 8,3 l/100 km (WLTP)."}

The magical backdrop of Lake Como provided the setting for unforgettable days at this year’s edition of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este, the world’s most prestigious and traditional classic-car event. From 23th to 25th May, the magnificent grounds of the Hotel Villa d’Este brought together a fabulous variety of vehicles competing in eight irresistibly appealing classes. The event captivated the numerous visitors and was widely covered by the international press, finally being crowned by the presentation to a radiant winner.\n\nThe Alfa Romeo Tipo B (P3) from 1934 won the contest. Historically, this speedster was by no means just any race car – it was a groundbreaking machine that redefined the concept of Grand Prix racing. Designed by the brilliant Vittorio Jano, this was one of the first true single-seater racing cars. On Sunday, the proud owner from the Auriga Collection in Germany received the prestigious winner’s prize “Trofeo BMW Group – Best of Show”. It was presented by Helmut Käs, Head of BMW Group Classic and President of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este and Wilhelm Schmid, CEO of A. Langeund Söhne. Alongside the stunning trophy, the winner selected by the Jury received a unique model of the 1815 Chronograph in white gold. The exclusive watch was created by A. Lange und Söhne especially for the winner of the “Best of Show”.\n\nThe “Coppa d’Oro Villa d’Este” selected by Public Referendum was won by the BMW 507 from the year 1957. Its sleek and superbly balanced body design paired with a 3.2 litre V8 engine made it an icon of automotive engineering. The Roadster, which is one of the greatest BMW icons to this day and was presented by Dirk de Groen from the United States of America, received the most votes from visitors to the event.\n\nFriday evening saw the BMW M design world premiere of the BMW M2 CS, a new high-performance sports car conceived for sheer driving pleasure. The BMW Group Cocktail launched a festive first night with two further stunning world premieres: the BMW Concept Speedtop, an exclusive three-door interpretation of a BMW Touring with a unique colour and material concept, and the BMW Motorrad Concept RR, an insight into the next generation of BMW RR Superbikes.\n\nThe glamourous setting in the mosaic garden of Hotel Villa d´Este provided a fitting backdrop for marking the 70th anniversary of an icon in automotive design: the BMW 507. In addition, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars celebrated a special milestone, the centenary of the very first Phantom. The movie career of the pinnacle model in the marque’s portfolio was honoured with an exhibition showcasing the Rolls-Royce Phantom Goldfinger, a one-of-one masterpiece celebrating the story of the James Bond film from 1964.\n\nOn both Public Days, BMW Group Classic successfully engaged a wide and diverse range of visitors. “Amici & Automobili - Wheels & Weisswürscht“ on Saturday brought together fans of legendary automobiles and numerous enthusiasts from BMW automobile clubs alongside clubs of other brands from northern and central Europe in the extensive park of Villa Erba. An impressive exhibition of various BMW 3 Series models of all generations celebrated the 50th anniversary of the legendary model series. Following the event, an independent BMW-only auction by first-time partner Broad Arrow Auctions honoured the brand’s rich history from the first BMW 328 and BMW 507 to the dynamic BMW M models of today.\n\nOnce again sold out, the “Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este Public Day - Il Festival” attracted a large audience with its numerous highlights. Dreams came true for many fans of classic race cars with a special exhibition celebrating 85 years of the “BMW Mille Miglia Icons”. It showcased the surviving original vehicles that achieved a glorious overall Mille Miglia victory for BMW in 1940. Other attractions on the extensive grounds of Villa Erba included the presentation of Art Car No. 13 by Sandro Chia (an artistically impressive BMW M3 GTR) and an exhibition celebrating the 70th anniversary of the three-wheeled BMW Isetta. The Public Day also gave spectators an opportunity to celebrate their shared fascination for automobility as they watched the spectacular parade of all the Historic Cars competing in the award classes of the Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este 2025. The impressive show spanned an arc from the past into the future, not least through the “Concept Cars & Prototypes” class.\n\nAt the end of the parade on Sunday, Helmut Käs (Head of BMW Group Classic and President of the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este) and Massimiliano di Silvestre (President of BMW Italy) presented the proceeds from Saturday's ticket sales and an additional amount from BMW Group Classic as a donation to Matteo Monti (Mayor of Cernobbio) for two kindergartens in the town of Cernobbio.\n\n“The Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este 2025 offers a unique opportunity to highlight the enduring fascination of mobility, seamlessly bridging the automobile’s storied past with its contemporary and future iterations. We believe this event transcends mere exclusivity. First and foremost, it is about cultivating a vibrant experience for all enthusiasts of historic cars during our dedicated Public Days,” explained Helmut Käs (CEO of BMW Group Classic and President of the Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este).\n\n“Villa d’Este has been the custodian of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d´Este since 1929, an event that brings together tradition and timeless elegance, with class, design and engineering in a uniquely inspiring setting. Year after year, the success of the event lies in the unique cars showcased along with the emotion and passion shared by generations of motor-car enthusiasts. We are grateful to the BMW Group for the long-lasting collaboration and look forward to many more memorable events in the future,” commented Davide Bertilaccio (CEO of Villa d´Este Hotels).\n\nFuel consumption and emissions figures: BMW M2 CS\n\nRolls-Royce Phantom Goldfinger"}

At the second race weekend of the DTM season at the Lausitzring (GER), Schubert Motorsport achieved the first podium finishes with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. René Rast (GER) made it onto the podium in both races – third on Saturday and second on Sunday after a photo finish. Marco Wittmann (GER) also had good pace, especially shining with second place on the grid on Sunday. Although he fell back due to a technical problem with the ABS during the race, he still collected points in both races, as he did at the season opener at Oschersleben (GER) – this time finishing fifth and eighth.\n\nOne of the keys to the strong results was the improved performance of both cars in qualifying. Good grip on the Lausitzring asphalt positively impacted the BMW M4 GT3 EVO lap times. Another key was the extremely good pit stops by the Schubert team. They brought Rast forward in both races and especially on Sunday put him in a position to temporarily take the lead and even fight for victory until shortly before the finish. Ultimately, he had to let Jack Aitken (GBR, Ferrari) pass but won the sprint to the finish against Jules Gounon (AND, Mercedes) for second place in a photo finish.\n\nWittmann defended his second place at the start on Sunday but encountered severe problems in turn 1 after a few laps when the ABS on his car temporarily failed. He slid straight ahead with locked wheels, damaging his tyres. In the laps before the pit stop window opened, he lost many positions, but thanks to some strong overtaking manoeuvres during the race, he managed to fight back to eighth place. Overall, Schubert Motorsport has a strong points haul after two race weekends in the 2025 season. Rast is sixth in the driver standings with 47 points, and Wittmann is ninth with 39 points. In the team standings, defending champion Schubert Motorsport is third with 84 points.\n\nAt the season opener of the ADAC GT Masters, the three BMW M4 GT3 EVOs from the teams Schubert Motorsport and FK Performance Motorsport achieved top-ten results. The best position in each of the two races was sixth place for FK Performance Motorsport.\n\nComments on the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"This weekend at the Lausitzring was very successful, especially for René Rast with third and second places. In the Sunday race, we showed a lot of action together with Mercedes and provided an exciting photo finish. It was very unfortunate for Marco Wittmann. He drove a great qualifying, with second place on the front row. That made us very proud. Unfortunately, he had bad luck in the Sunday race, but overall, he collected important points over the weekend with fifth and eighth positions. Everything is still possible for him. We can be satisfied and look forward to the next race weekend. In the ADAC GT Masters, we saw that we learned a lot this weekend. I am confident that we will present ourselves even stronger next time.\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): \"Of course, we can be satisfied with second and third places. That was not necessarily expected beforehand. In the end, even more could have been possible. I feel particularly sorry for Marco that he had the problem with the ABS. We need to look closely at how the temporary failure of the system occurred. It's a shame that he lost many points because of it, even though he still managed to finish eighth and collect some points. Both drivers did a great job here, and the team was also fantastic during the pit stops.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 3rd place, R2: 2nd place): \"It was an amazing weekend. Third place yesterday, second place today – I think that was more than we hoped for before the weekend. If someone had told me that, I would have signed immediately. It was a good points haul, and the team did a great job throughout the weekend. Especially with the pit stops; I think today we were only able to take the lead because of the pit stops. Unfortunately, we didn't quite have the pace of the Ferrari; my tyres just faded too early again. We need to work on that a bit more, but overall, it was a great team result for my car. It's a shame that Marco's race went the way it did. He could have been in contention for the win today. That would have been even better for the team.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 5th place, R2: 8th place): \"Fifth place on Saturday was already a good result, and with second place on the grid, I went into the second race with confidence. The start was already very chaotic. Then my ABS failed, the wheels massively locked, and I went straight ahead. From then on, the race for a podium was over because the tyres were square. There was no real deceleration possible anymore, the car had no cornering behaviour, and it was just about getting through until the pit stop window opened to get fresh tyres. Overall, we have to say that the high grip on the track helped us but there was generally a positive trend seen this weekend, also in qualifying performance. Now it's about continuing like this and repeating it.\""}

At the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy, the BMW Group is presenting an exclusive new concept car that will subsequently be made available for purchase in a small series.\n\nThe BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with unique proportions. \"A true BMW exudes dynamism and elegance even when it’s standing still,\" says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. \"And that’s also the case with our new concept car. The #BMW Concept Speedtop is characterised first of all by its profile. It is very unique in the automotive industry. In this way, we have created an exclamation mark for our entire lineup of vehicles, especially for the Touring models.\"\n\nThe generous interior invites for weekend getaways for two. High-quality materials, the focus on every detail, and the stylistic connection between exterior and interior are a testament for its true craftsmanship.\n\nThe #BMW Concept Speedtop shares its eye-catching form language with the BMW Skytop and will be offered to collectors and connoisseurs in a strictly limited small series.\n\nThe pronounced V-shape of the front end, with its shark-nose design, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidney grille give the BMW Concept Speedtop an unmistakable presence. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler gives the car a dynamic Touring profile. The colour gradient on the roof, moving from “Floating Sunstone Maroon” to “Floating Sundown Silver”, accentuates this shape. The athletic design is enhanced by the car’s broad shoulders. Its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop.\n\nThe interior of the BMW Concept Speedtop was designed with a strong focus to even the smallest detail. Skillfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and emphasise the manufactory-level craftmanship on display.\n\nThe two-tone colour and material concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tone of the “Floating Sunstone Maroon” exterior paint is carried over into the interior. Here, the brown \"Sundown Maroon\" world harmonises with the light \"Moonstone White\" of the seats. The two-tone leather upholstery divides the dynamic and functional areas of the interior. The visually striking roof spline in the exterior is mirrored as a light beam in the two-tone leather headliner, providing an atmospheric, indirect illumination. The trunk is also leather-covered and refined with brogue-style perforations.\n\nA light beam illuminates the luggage compartment, which is divided into two sections. This allows large items of luggage to be stowed inside for multi-day trips.The elaborate craftsmanship in the exterior and interior was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing.\n\nThe virtuosity in the design of the BMW Concept Speedtop is further enhanced through the collaboration with the traditional Italian manufacturer Schedoni. Known for the production of exclusive and high-quality leather goods by hand, especially in the automotive sector, Schedoni has always stood for highest quality and customisation. Two storage areas with leather straps behind the seats provide space for two of Schedoni’s made-to-measure bags. The bags were designed exclusively for the Concept to fit in with its colour and material concept. A matching weekend bag can also be accommodated in the trunk.\n\nThe concept car’s engine ensures it scales the heights not only in terms of design, but also performance.

As part of the prestigious Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este at Lake Como, BMW Motorrad unveils its latest creation for the superbike segment: the BMW Motorrad Concept RR as the ultimate performance statement in terms of technology and design for the future generation of BMW RR models.\n\nMarkus Flasch, Head of BMW Motorrad: \"Never before has BMW Motorrad provided such an early glimpse into a future generation of the RR models. The BMW MotorradConcept RR is a true masterpiece of our development team, both technically and in terms of design language. Guided and inspired by the BMW Motorrad factory superbikeM 1000 RR, with which BMW Motorrad factory rider Toprak Razgatlioğlu was able to dominantly win the FIM World Superbike Championship last year, the Concept RR offers a true firework of superlatives for both street and track use. The transfer from racing to road has never been shown more clearly. It represents BMW Motorrad's leadership claim to offer the highest engineering level and maximum performance in this segment.\"\n\nMaximum performance, based on the BMW factory superbike.\n\nBMW Motorrad engages in motorsport out of passion and conviction – on the tracks of the FIM Superbike World Championship as well as in numerous national and international championships. Every day, the BMW Motorrad team lives the symbiosis of engineering excellence and an unyielding drive for top performance anew. This dedication is reflected in every detail of our superbikes, and the valuable insights gained from racing are incorporated into our production models.\n\nIn terms of propulsion, the BMW Motorrad Concept RR relies on the water-cooled inline four-cylinder engine of the world champion machine from the FIM Superbike World Championship, which already delivers more than 230 hp (169 kW). This promises pure adrenaline in terms of propulsion and reinforces the leadership claim in the superbike segment. Accompanying this are the electronic control and regulation systems that come directly from the WSBK M 1000 RR, such as the engine management, traction control, and engine brake.\n\nNew benchmark in terms of lightweight construction and aerodynamics.\n\nBy innovative manufacturing techniques and the use of high-tech materials such as carbon and aluminum, the BMW Motorrad Concept RR sets new benchmarks in lightweight construction. From the frame to the smallest component, every detail is consistently optimized for lightweight construction and performance. The design also follows this principle: sharp, purposeful, expressive - with an embossed RR logo on the tail and an illuminated RR symbol on the downside of the delicate aluminum tail.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad engineers placed special emphasis on aerodynamics, particularly on the challenging objectives of \"riding stability at very high speeds,\" \"maximum cornering speeds,\" and \"minimal air resistance for optimal top speed.\" These competing goals are realized by the Concept RR through an unprecedentedly compact package, reduced external attachments, and enhanced precision of airflow, even through the motorcycle – from the ventilated front to the monolithic, also ventilated, aerodynamically optimized rear.\n\nIn addition, the concept bike is equipped with an aerodynamically optimized fairing with integrated winglets and high-performance brakes – uncompromisingly perfected for ambitious super-sporty use on the road up to professional racing.\n\nThe matching outfit – the jacket Concept RR LTD.\n\nBMW Motorrad has been consistently implementing the claim to make motorcycling as safe and comfortable as possible with perfectly designed clothing, while also stylishly shaping the motorcycle lifestyle with attractive fashion, for more then 45 years. Today, it offers a comprehensive program of Riders Gear and Casual Wear. Once again, the maxim for BMW Motorrad is: Make existing things even better and simultaneously develop new innovative solutions. Accordingly, on the occasion of the presentation of theBMW Motorrad Concept RR, a unique lifestyle jacket was developed: the Concept RR LTD jacket, limited to 50 units. A masterpiece made of fine calf Nappa leather, crafted in cooperation with the traditional Bavarian company MEINDL, this jacket combines motorsport flair with the highest craftsmanship and exclusivity."}

The Sport variant captivates thanks to a finish in Marina Bay Blue metallic with outsized “46” graphics in Tanzanite Blue metallic and bright yellow accents on the BMW M kidney grille, the brake calipers and the forged light-alloy wheels. In the “Style” design variant, the bodywork comes in matte Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic, with the “46” in Frozen Marina Bay Blue metallic. The carbon-fibre roof of both variants is adorned with the VR46 logo and Rossi’s signature. Both the bonnet and the roof were manufactured and individually painted at BMW Group Plant Landshut. The component plant also provided the lightweight high-precision struts for the engine compartment and engine parts such as the crankcase and the cylinder head, which were installed in the high-performance drive system at BMW Group Plant Steyr.\n\nSpecial production processes at BMW Group Werk DingolfingThe production of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 reveals the impressive levels of flexibility and skill applied to manufacturing exclusive small-batch series at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. The Jeff Koons edition models for the BMW 8 Series and the 50 examples of the BMW 3.0 CSL first saw the light of day at the Bavarian plant, where high-tech manufacturing and craftsmanship go hand in hand, in the paint shop in particular.\n\nFor the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, an underlying colour tone was applied as primer before the cars were removed from the series production process. The entire paintwork surface was then sanded down to improve the adhesion of the subsequent paint layers. The paintwork experts in Dingolfing then applied specially-made stencils to mask the “46” and other design elements, such as the bright yellow lines on the rear end and the A-column, before adding the contrast colour to the masking film. Once all the layers of paint had dried and the masking film had been removed, a clear varnish coating was added to the design area by hand and then sanded down – after drying again – to guarantee seamless transitions and a flawless surface. The cars then returned to the regular series production process to receive another layer of clear varnish and for the installation of the carbon-fibre roof that was manufactured in Landshut. Overall, each car required 20 hours’ work from a small team of four hand-picked paint experts to complete the exclusive BMW Individual paint finish on the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46.\n\nVehicle assembly: components and interior characterised by VR46The next step in the production process took the edition cars to Dingolfing for assembly. The exclusive design is also reflected in the installed components, such as the bumpers specially painted in Landshut, and on the inside of the car. Night Blue dominates in the interior, with yellow accents. The M Carbon bucket seats have a shoulder area in Sao Paulo Yellow, with yellow contrast stitching and a yellow centre marker on the steering wheel. The headrests and door sill trims feature a prominent yellow VR46 logo, while the carbon-fibre centre console of all examples features a “1/46” badge. Having passed extensive quality controls, the cars of this exclusive edition are now ready for delivery to the two sets of 46 customers around the world.\n\nIncludes a “once in a lifetime” experience for customersCustomers who purchase one of the 405 kW/550 HP BMW M4 CS Edition VR46s also enjoy the added value of a “once in a lifetime” experience: an exclusive personal meeting with Valentino Rossi at his home, the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia (ITA), and a BMW M Driving Experience with current BMW M models at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli. Rossi, at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3, won GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup races at his home circuit in both 2023 and 2024 and is aiming to complete a hat-trick this year. “The Doctor” has been a BMW M works driver since the start of the 2023 season, plying his trade at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 for BMW M Team WRT, having called time on his motorcycle career at the 2021 season finale and turned his attention solely to car racing. He had already attended multiple tests in Formula 1 race cars and made guest appearances in rallies and endurance races. The Italian has been competing as a BMW M works driver in the GT World Challenge Europe, with the 24 Hours of Spa (BEL) as a highlight, as well as racing in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) or at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), where he celebrated second place in the BMW M4 GT3 at the opening round of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC).\n\nCreating a legend on two wheels“Il Dottore” had already become a living legend and global motorsport and style icon on two wheels. With nine world championships and no fewer than 115 Grand Prix victories to his name, he is one of the three most successful motorcycle racers in history. Rossi claimed his first world title in the 125cc class in 1997. Two years later, he added the title in the 250cc class. In 2000, he took the step up to what was the top Grand Prix category, the 500cc class, in which he was crowned world champion in 2001. Rossi remained the dominant force when this category was replaced by the MotoGP class the following year. By 2005 he had added a further four world titles, and numbers eight and nine were to follow in 2008 and 2009. VR46 became a world-famous trademark – and Rossi’s home town of Tavullia even reduced its speed limit from the usual 50 km/h to 46 km/h in his honour.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption and emission figures:Fuel consumption combined: 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 232 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G."}

Rothberg, who had already celebrated his third win of the season at Austin (USA) at the end of April, has been on the podium in the past seven races – and continues to lead the overall standings in GT America at the season's halfway point.\n\nGT4 European Series: Leandri and de Barn win again at Zandvoort.\n\nAt the second race weekend of the GT4 European Series at Zandvoort (NED), Jean-Mathieu Leandri and Antoni de Barn (both FRA) confirmed their outstanding form in the Am category. After two class wins at the season opener at Le Castellet (FRA), the duo from Team CHAZEL Technologie Course in the #317 BMW M4 GT4 EVO had to settle for second place in a close duel in the first race. In the second race, however, Leandri and de Barn were once again unbeatable, celebrating their third win in the fourth race of the season and confidently defending the overall lead in the Am category.\n\nIn the Silver Class, BMW M Motorsport had to settle for two fourth places on the Circuit Zandvoort after two podiums at the season start. Benjamin Lessennes (BEL) and Ricardo van der Ende (NED) from Team L'Espace Bienvenue, who had finished third at Le Castellet, worked their way from ninth on the grid to fourth place in the first race in the #17 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. In the second race, Berkay Besler (TUR) and Gabriele Piana (ITA) from Team Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport narrowly missed the podium. At Le Castellet, their teammates Pedro Ebrahim (BRA) and Yagiz Gedik (TUR) had also finished third on the podium in the Silver Class.\n\nGT Cup Series: Wins and podiums at the Red Bull Ring.\n\nThe GT Cup Series started the 2025 season at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) over the weekend. On the programme was an endurance race on Saturday and two sprint races on Sunday. The BMW M Motorsport teams collected wins and podiums.\n\nIn the one-hour endurance race, with mandatory pit stops and driver changes, second and third places on the overall podium went to crews with the BMW M4 GT3. Jürgen Alzen and Timo Scheibner (both GER / H&R Spezialfedern) finished second, directly followed by Rudolf Beňo and Richard Gonda (both SVK / Aries Racing). These pairings also each won their class in categories 6+8 and GT3.\n\nTwo wins for Team H&R Spezialfedern came in the two sprint races on Sunday. Alzen won the first race, and his teammate Scheibner took the top step of the podium in the second race. Beňo finished fourth and secured the GT3 class win.\n\nBMW M works driver Max Hesse (GER) was also at Spielberg. He supported Team Racing Trevor, which fielded a BMW M4 GT3 EVO, and shared the cockpit with Antal Szigo. The duo retired early from the endurance race. In the sprint races, Szigo and Hesse each finished second in the GT3 class.\n\nChina GT Championship: Four wins in four races for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nBMW M Motorsport also impressed at the second race weekend of the China GT Championship. Erik Johansson (SWE) and Huang Ruohan (CHN) won both races in the #90 BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Shanghai International Circuit (CHN), continuing the winning streak of the FIST Team AAI. At the season opener three weeks earlier, Johansson and Yu Lin (CHN) had already won both races at Shanghai. Johansson took sole leadership in the driver standings of the China GT Championship after his fourth win in four races."}

They will be joined by experienced Nürburgring racer and motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER). The car will be fielded by FK Performance Motorsport.\n\nMedia guide with all information on the BMW M2 Racing: \n\nThe BMW M2 Racing has already completed more than 30,000 test kilometres and will be available to BMW M Motorsport customer teams as the ideal entry-level race car from the 2026 season. In this final major test, the car will compete in the SP3T class and be put through its paces by the drivers and team under the extreme conditions of an endurance race. Klingmann has been actively involved in every stage of the BMW M2 Racing’s development and has played a key role in preparing the car for launch. De Wilde recently earned his Nordschleife permit and will make his 24-hour race debut. Weerts finished third overall in 2024 and now trades his GT3 seat for valuable test duties with BMW M Motorsport. Bräutigam has driven many race cars and will bring a journalistic perspective to the BMW M2 Racing thanks to his extensive experience. FK Performance Motorsport oversaw the car’s debut at the first test race in the 2024 Nürburgring Endurance Series and will manage it again during the Qualifiers and the 24h race in 2025. At the Qualifiers this coming weekend, Weerts, de Wilde, and Bräutigam will take turns at the wheel, with Klingmann joining for the 24-hour race.\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “With the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring, the intensive test and development phase of our new entry-level car, the BMW M2 Racing, comes to an end. For one final time, our works drivers will collect data and impressions to help us deliver a car to our customers that is as well-prepared as possible. The Eifel endurance race is the ultimate test of strength. I’m delighted that we can also give the media the exclusive opportunity to experience the car’s performance firsthand.”\n\nUgo de Wilde: “I can’t wait to be there. I did my permit on the Nordschleife this year and I really love the track. It is an amazing circuit and the atmosphere around there was already fantastic in NLS so I can’t wait to discover the 24–hour race and to compete there with the brand new BMW M2 Racing. It’s really excting; I’ve heard really good comments from Charles and the other drivers who opportunity to test it already.”\n\nJens Klingmann: “The 24 Hours of Nürburgring marks the final major dress rehearsal for our BMW M2 Racing. We’ve completed a long and intensive testing and development phase and have covered a lot of kilometres. Now we’re especially looking forward to putting the car through its paces once more in race conditions, to ensure we can hand over a perfectly developed BMW M2 Racing to our customers. I believe we are very well prepared. We’ve simulated every scenario for all areas of use – whether on the Nordschleife, in other championships, or for track days. Of course, things are always a bit different in real race conditions. For example, you see how driver changes go, or whether everything is finalised on the software side. So this is truly the final big test before production begins.”\n\nCharles Weerts: “I can’t wait to be at the Nordschleife for a legendary race, the 24 hours. I’ve got lucky enough to be driving their last year with the BMW M4 GT3, with Max Hesse and Dan Harper, and we finished third on our first attempt together which is definitely a nice memory. This year we come back with a different approach and different goals. I will be sharing duties with Jens Klingmann, Ugo de Wilde and Michael Bräutigam in the new BMW M2 Racing where we will do our best for BMW M Motorsport to optimally develop this car for the customer in 2026. I am very much looking forward to see how this car will handle in the ‘Green Hell’ and can’t wait to be there again.”"}

New intelligent multi-agent system BMW Group AIconic Agent for more efficient information procurement and optimized decision-making.", "tags": ["Purchasing", "IT-Hub", "Romania", "Artificial Intelligence", "Digitalisation", "Technology", "Information Technology", "Corporation", "Corporate"], "url": "https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0450032EN/greater-efficiency-and-productivity-with-artificial-intelligence-–-generative-ai-in-bmw-group-purchasing", "content": "Munich. Digitalization is one of the strategic top priorities for the BMW Group‘s Purchasing and Supplier Network. The BMW Group pursues a specific focus on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to increase the efficiency and long-term viability of the Purchasing and Supplier Network. That’s why the organization is accelerating its digital transformation, through developing innovative applications and strategic cooperation with the BMW Group’s IT hub in Romania.\n\n“At the BMW Group, we consider AI to be more than just a technological innovation. We see it as a key element of the digital transformation,” emphasized Hendrik Lang, Senior Vice President Strategy, Digitalization and Sustainability, Purchasing and Supplier Network at BMW Group. “Empowering our people to use AI technologies is our top priority,” he added. A group-wide AI platform supports customized applications to optimize processes, increase efficiency and create innovative solutions. In these efforts, AI serves as a tool that completes certain tasks faster or automates subtasks, giving employees more freedom for creative and innovative thinking.\n\nThe BMW Group is building strategic AI expertise and developing specific AI applications for the Purchasing and Supplier Network at its IT hub in Romania. By the end of the year, the location will be home to a team of experts working on cutting-edge GenAI applications for internal processes worldwide. Founded in the thriving tech center of Cluj-Napoca in summer 2024 as a joint venture of the BMW Group and NTT DATA Romania, BMW TechWorks Romania is tasked with consistently expanding the BMW Group’s Europe-based software expertise according to long-term demands. BMW TechWorks Romania is closely integrated into the BMW Group’s global development and innovation landscape and benefits from Romania’s robust IT and software industry.\n\nBMW Group Purchasing is actively driving forward the development and implementation of internal AI applications. The initial GenAI tools – including Knowledge Navigator, Offer Analyst and Tender Assistant – were introduced in Purchasing as early as 2024. These applications serve as central knowledge databases that assist in the analysis and comparison of supplier offers as well as tender creation and management. For example, Offer Analyst can perform repetitive tasks and significantly reduce the time required for each offer.\n\nIn late 2024, the BMW Group also introduced a central AI access point for the Purchasing and Supplier Network: the BMW Group’s AIconic agent system. This innovative AI solution transforms how teams search for and utilize information by combining cutting-edge natural language processing with intelligent algorithms. The multi-agent system ensures fast, precise data searches and customized processing results for individual users. Integrating different data sources guarantees comprehensive, targeted information retrieval that significantly outperforms previous search functions. With over 1,800 active users performing 10,000 searches, the AI solution has been exceptionally well-received in a short period of time, highlighting its value. “Our multi-agent system AIconic significantly increases employee efficiency and productivity while setting new standards for AI usage,” emphasized Markus Kronen, Head of GenAI in Purchasing and Supplier Network at the BMW Group.\n\nThe AIconic multi-agent system is continuously updated to meet the growing demands of the Purchasing and Supplier Network. A top priority is agentization, meaning AIconic will act not simply as a passive search tool but increasingly as a proactive one. The comprehensive agent system currently includes ten agents covering topics such as quality, purchasing and supplier data and purchasing process support. In the future, the application will perform certain tasks without human supervision, such as monitoring supply chain data, creating reports and identifying optimization potential. The next iteration will transform AIconic into an intelligent internal assistant that not only provides information, but also actively recommends actions and automates processes. To make the best use of AI solutions, the BMW Group provides digital training and special AI innovation spaces for employees at all levels. In doing so, employees acquire digital literacy and share their new skills throughout the organization. Clear governance provides a mandatory framework for training and implementing AI solutions, be it for internal applications or procuring external AI expertise.\n\nAIconic is one of the first multi-agent use cases that the BMW Group has implemented on a central AI platform. It has been successfully established as a standard in the Purchasing division. The multi-agent system is based on the BMW Group AI Assistant, the central AI access point for the entire organization. As such, AIconic demonstrates how intelligent agent systems can be developed and deployed across the organization using the AI platform.\n\n*The images displayed were generated using artificial intelligence.\n\nMerete Wonneberger, Communications Purchasing and Supplier Network\n\nFlorian Moser, Communications Purchasing and Supplier Network\n\nInternet:"}

The fifth event of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team to Most in the Czech Republic. There, reigning world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) on the BMW M 1000 RR proved to be – at least almost – unbeatable. ‘El Turco’ was the fastest in all practice sessions, secured pole position, won race one and the Superpole race, clocked the fastest lap in all three races, and set new lap records. In the second main race, it looked like he would complete the hat-trick until just a few metres from the finish. Only shortly before the finish line was long-time rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) able to overtake, and Razgatlioglu had to settle for second place by a mere 0.027 seconds. Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) had double bad luck at Most. In Superpole, he was among the many riders whose fastest lap was cancelled due to a yellow flag, leaving him 15th on the grid. At the start of race one, he was involved in a multi-rider crash through no fault of his own and had to retire. On Sunday, van der Mark finished 13th and 14th.\n\nReactions after the Most round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “What a weekend! We’re extremely proud of the entire team – those at the track, at home, and in the test team. Everyone has worked very hard since Cremona, and that has put us in a position to take pole position and two wins. We only missed out on race two by a few hundredths of a second. Of course, that hurt, but overall, the performance Toprak showed this weekend was incredible. What he delivered on the bike was simply outstanding. All in all, we now head into the next races at Misano with a positive outlook. We’ve managed to reduce the points gap in both the riders’ and manufacturers’ standings. Mickey was strong in the practice sessions, but unfortunately unlucky in Superpole, which meant he had to start from the back and couldn’t fight his way forward properly. Now we go to Misano knowing that we can fight again and that we’re right in the mix. We’re looking forward to Italy and will give everything to close the gap even further.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was once again an intense weekend here at Most, which is practically a home race for us. It’s just a few hours’ drive from Munich, and there were many fans from Germany here. Friday’s practice sessions were run under very tricky mixed conditions. Still, Toprak managed them very solidly and showed very strong race pace during a simulation in FP2. That the BMW M 1000 RR has this kind of pace was confirmed on Saturday and Sunday. In Superpole, Toprak translated the bike’s performance into a perfect lap time. What followed were three extremely strong races from him. Mickey showed good performance in free practice. His weekend was heavily affected by the complicated qualifying, with his final fast lap being deleted due to yellow flags. That meant he had no chance to start further up the grid. His starting position made all his races difficult, and he couldn’t show his or the bike’s full potential. We’ll see him come back stronger at Misano. Overall, it was a successful weekend for us with two wins and a second place – only 0.027 seconds behind. We’ve shown that we can continue to fight with Ducati and Nicolò Bulega for the World Championship, even though they still seem to have an advantage on the straights after the latest fuel flow regulation changes. So we leave Most with one eye smiling – and one eye crying, because the hat-trick just didn’t happen.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The weekend started amazingly for me. We took pole and won the first two races. But in the second main race, I had some bad luck. It was not a technical problem but in the last few sectors on the final lap the bike felt strange. On the straight, I felt some cut and we lost P1. Anyway, it was a hard effort by everyone and we did a really good weekend. I’m just a bit unhappy that we did not do three wins but only two. Overall, it was not bad, we collected important points for the championship and everything else, we will see at the next race.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I started the weekend quite well. In FP1 and FP2, we had a strong pace and good lap times. My feeling with the bike was good, also in FP3 I felt confident. In Superpole, they unfortunately took my lap away because of the yellow flag. So I was starting from P15 which isn’t ideal on this track where it is hard to pass and the differences are so small. In the first race, I was just unlucky in turn 1, being taken out by someone elses crash. It was a big shame but it happens. In the Superpole race, I tried to get into the top nine so I had to pass but unfortunately could not make it. So I started from 15th again. I had a good start and strong first couple of corners but then I struggled a lot with the bike. It was so hard to ride and I couldn’t maintain a good pace. At the end, I lost a few positions again. It was very strange. We had a good start to the weekend but then difficult races. Now I’m looking forward to Misano to make some progress there.”\n\nAir temperature: 14°, track temperature: 24°, humidity: 48%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAir temperature: 16°, track temperature: 27°, humidity: 43%, conditions: dry, laps: 22.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 10, 1:31.109 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 12°, track temperature: 22°, humidity: 56%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:30.201 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 14°, track temperature: 22°, humidity: 51%, conditions: dry, laps: 22.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nGYTR GRT Yamaha WorldSBK Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:30.379\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R05/12, after 15 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R05/12, after 15 of 36 races)."}

The BMW Group is consistently improving digitalization in the production of its components. From AI-driven production management and smart logistics processes to data-based quality controls – the #Landshut plant, the company's largest component manufacturing site, utilizes state-of-the-art technologies and thus plays a central role as an innovation hub within the automotive and supplier industries.\n\nAt the BMW Group plant in Landshut, for example, the company uses AI-supported data analysis to detect anomalies in data traffic at an early stage and ward off cyberattacks. In addition, digital process control and networked production facilities are used to increase productivity and improve quality.\n\nThomas Thym, Head of the BMW Group Plant Landshut: \"We not only implement technical progress, but also actively shape it in order to secure our competitiveness in the long term. Behind every digital car there must also be a digital factory.\"\n\nShopfloor Digital in Component Manufacturing: Connected Production for Greater TransparencyA key component of the BMW Group's digitalization strategy is the \"Shopfloor.Digital\" transformation program. The goal is to harmonize manufacturing processes and IT systems worldwide across all 30 production sites. To achieve this, the company is building a modern, cloud-based IT architecture and relying on process automation and AI solutions. As a component manufacturing site, the Landshut plant is a key component of this transformation program. \"We view complexity as an opportunity and use the data we gain to continuously improve our processes,\" explains Franz Heigl, Head of Digitalization of Component Manufacturing.\n\nLean Management: Digital Tools for Lean ProcessesAt the same time, the BMW Group is driving forward the digitalization of its lean management approaches. This includes a digital process map in the production areas, a digital disruption process, and value stream management. To ensure the organization's common alignment, the goal development process serves as an effective leadership and steering tool, enabling goals to be broken down to their basics and translated into concrete challenges. \"Our goal is to focus on the essentials in our day-to-day business and prioritize value-creating activities,\" says Heigl.\n\nSmart production, smart logistics: Connected supply and production chains for greater flexibility and efficiencyThe BMW Group is also consistently pursuing its digitalization initiative in logistics and manufacturing. With the help of sensors, real-time data, and AI-driven processes, the Landshut plant is optimizing its supply chains, material flows, and production processes. This will enable the production sites to be even more closely connected with suppliers to avoid bottlenecks and conserve resources.\n\nOne example of this is the production of the BMW Energy Master, the central control unit of the high-voltage battery for the Neue Klasse vehicles. Comprehensive inline monitoring, including AI-based camera systems, as well as 100% end-of-line system testing in a cleanroom environment meet the highest quality standards. The Landshut plant will supply all battery assembly plants worldwide with the BMW Energy Master in the future, where the control unit will then be mounted on the high-voltage battery in a final assembly step.\n\nThe Landshut plant also relies on automation and digitalization in the production of cockpits. During the final quality control, around 50 quality features are checked in just 30 seconds. This is followed by fully automated packaging and transport of the parts. This involves autonomous transport systems that move independently from the starting point to the destination without relying on an external control system.\n\nIn the Landshut plant's light metal foundry, the automaker is currently producing aluminum housings for the Neue Klasse electric engines in a pre-series production run. High quality standards are applied in the manufacture of our products. To ensure these standards are consistently met, modern technologies are used, such as inline computed tomography (CT). Every single electric motor housing manufactured at the Landshut plant undergoes a fully automated CT scan. Within just 42 seconds, 2,400 individual images are captured and reconstructed into a 3D model of the component. In contrast to the majority of applications in the medical field, quality control here is fully automated using artificial intelligence. This allows the powerful CT technology to be integrated extremely efficiently into the production process while simultaneously ensuring the quality of the parts.\n\nQuality in the Supply Chain: Supplier QualificationTo ensure high quality standards in production, the BMW Group is also focusing on digitalization in its supply chain. At the ZDSC (Zero Defect Supply Chain) Campus, suppliers receive interactive training on topics such as shop floor management, production systems, and digitalization. The goal is to work with partners to establish a stable production system with a \"zero-defect mentality.\" In this way, the BMW Group actively involves its partners and suppliers in the digital transformation.\n\nAI LAbThe AI ​​LAb is a new innovation and collaboration space that enables all employees at the BMW Group Landshut Plant to try out and learn new AI-based technologies using application-oriented examples. The application examples cover a broad spectrum of AI applications: The Technology Trend Radar provides a structured overview of direct and indirect AI applications, sorted by technology and maturity level. With PowerApps, employees can create their own digital applications without programming knowledge, thus digitizing processes and automating tasks. The AIQX (Artificial Intelligence Quality Next) computer system enables the automation and optimization of quality assurance in production using AI.\n\nOn May 14 and 15, 2025, the Landshut plant presented its already implemented, networked and data-driven production of components at the \"Smart Factory Day\"."}

Dependable. With a clear focus on the future.\n\nThe BMW way – for the success of your company.\n\nOur lives are increasingly digital – and, in global business, virtual formats offer many advantages. But, let's not forget – people are not digital. We all still value meeting face to face. We want to look each other in the eye.\n\nThat is why it is great to see so many of you here today, in the Olympiahalle. And to everyone joining us remotely: A very warm welcome to you as well!\n\nThis is your company’s 105th Annual General Meeting!\n\nThe heart of BMW beats all over the world. BMW is a global team, united by a strong sense of community. 159,000 people: highly motivated. High-performing. Innovative. Together, we are the BMW Group.\n\nOf course, one could also say: BMW, that's just a DAX-listed company. A reliable employer; at its core, it remains an abstract construct.\n\nBut everyone at the company knows that BMW is so much more than that! That is why we stand together. Time and again, we have proven that we seize opportunities, act swiftly and adapt with remarkable flexibility. We learn from the unexpected – which is what truly matters. We then emerge stronger than before – just as we did after the global financial crisis and the Covid pandemic.\n\nWe make decisions with a long-term perspective.\n\nThis mindset goes back to entrepreneur Herbert Quandt, whose family continues his legacy – much like we do here at BMW.\n\nYou, our shareholders, remain by our side in this. You give us entrepreneurial freedom – and that is a privilege we value, especially in turbulent times.\n\nToday, our environment is more dynamic than ever.\n\nWe face highly complex challenges, shaped by conflicting priorities and paradoxes. Above all, we are confronted with new geopolitical realities that directly affect our business.\n\nAt the same time, our industry is undergoing significant change. The shift towards e-mobility is just one facet of a broader, all-encompassing process – a technology race that culminates in elimination of some players.\n\nWhen things are uncertain, many stay stuck in “neutral”, waiting. Not your company! We are now shifting into “sport mode” –hands on the wheel, eyes on the road. Standing here on stage is the BMW Vision Neue Klasse you are already familiar with. Later on, I’ll even show you the first two production models of the NEUE KLASSE. Our vision is becoming reality, as we reach the next milestones for BMW and the entire company.\n\nBy anticipating trends in the marketplace early, we consistently manage to make major technological leaps at exactly the right time. We invest proactively in electrification, digitalisation, our production network, our products and the NEUE KLASSE. By 2024, we will have reached the peak of our investment and R&D activities, with expenditure in each area exceeding nine billion euros. This is a peak, not a plateau.\n\nWe have invested a considerable amount of money.\n\nIn the years ahead, the full impact of these upfront investments will become clear – just as I promised. We are realising our plans for the future with your best interests in mind. You, our shareholders, should benefit from the continuing success of your company, alongside our employees.\n\nThat is why we remain firmly committed to our shareholder return strategy: We are proposing a dividend payout of 36.7 percent of our unappropriated profit – which would amount to a total of 2.6 billion euros. If you approve our proposed dividend, this will be our highest-ever payout ratio.\n\nYour company is in a strong position, focused on the future:\n\nWe are digitalising our vehicles and leveraging tech clusters and architectures with massive scaling potential. We are utilising artificial intelligence throughout our value chain. Very soon, nearly every process at the company will be supported by AI, making us even faster and more precise – and not just in production and logistics. At your company, efficient cost structures are the standard – you can always count on that.\n\nThe automotive industry has been through many upheavals –in response to the rise of industrialisation, technological progress, new processes and evolving markets, as well as changing regulations and societal expectations.\n\nThe BMW way is shaped by confidence – because we provide meaningful answers. I would like to show you today how we do that through:\n\n1. Our strategy: which is market-driven and technology-open.\n\n2. Our goals: We met our adjusted targets for 2024 and are targeting growth this year.\n\n3. Our global footprint: a differentiating factor and competitive advantage in a fragmented world.\n\n4. Our future-focused project for tech leadership: BMW is the NEUE KLASSE – and the NEUE KLASSE is BMW.\n\nLet me begin with my first point: our strategy.\n\nTechnology openness means following the markets – because markets evolve, but not all at the same pace. We took a clear stand on this, even in the face of strong headwinds. Now, the wind has shifted in our direction:\n\n• “BMW late winner of the drivetrain transition”.\n\n• “How BMW went from laggard to magician”.\n\n• “Germany’s true electric-car champion”.\n\nThese headlines were taken from trade journal “Auto, Motor und Sport”; weekly magazine “Wirtschaftswoche”; and newspaper “Die Welt”.\n\nOur models and diverse drivetrain portfolio are also winning awards, including the “Goldene Lenkrad” (Golden Steering Wheel). I accepted three trophies in Berlin – a very special moment.\n\nOur brands and products are being extremely well received. The German Car of the Year award, presented to the 5 Series and i5*, is the first-ever win for a technology-open model series.\n\nWhile other manufacturers are reversing course or adjusting their strategy, we are on exactly the right track. Even policymakers are starting to come around: The new German federal government supports a broad approach to technology, while the European Commission seeks to make Europe more competitive. The “Green Industrial Deal” finally considers climate protection and the economy “in tandem”. That is a good thing.\n\nFrom e-drives and plug-in hybrids to highly efficient conventional drive technologies: No one masters this level of variety better than your company. As previously announced, we will be adding a production model with a hydrogen drivetrain in 2028. All of this benefits our customers, while, at the same time, making a measurable contribution to climate protection. And, yes, we have the facts and figures to back this up:\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group significantly outperformed its European CO2 fleet target by more than 30 grammes. That is a huge leap forward, which cannot just be taken for granted. Based on internal calculations, our numbers came in at under 100 grams for the first time – at 99.5 grammes per kilometre. The official data will be published by the European Commission at year-end. We are also gearing up to meet the much stricter targets for this year, as you would expect from us.\n\nWe take ambitious political goals seriously – but we don’t believe in technically one-sided regulations that limit supply. The same principle applies to the circular economy. Here, too, only a comprehensive approach can enable and stimulate investment. Because, as a standalone technology, e-mobility leads down a dead-end street – that much is now clear. The differences are simply too great, even just within Europe.\n\nBelgium, for example, offers incentives: Electric and hybrid models quickly became the most popular new cars, reaching a market share of over 60 percent in 2024. Contrast that with Italy, where electric cars made up only about four percent of total sales last year.\n\nIs that the fault of the products? Certainly not. Is it because of the customers? Definitely not. The all-important question is rather:\n\nHow do we effectively cut CO2? Certainly not by thinking in black and white. Supporting one solution does not necessarily mean opposing another. Our approach proves this time and again – and remains effective. We all need to be much more opportunity-driven, guided by entry – not exit – strategies.\n\nPolitical goals must reflect market realities – and also be viable for businesses. Global investment is already looking ahead to 2030, and especially 2035. That is why the upcoming review of EU targets will be so decisive. It is our chance to improve the system. Europe needs a top-performing automotive and supplier industry. We are fighting for this and pushing back against negative developments.\n\nFor our customers, we will remain broadly diversified – and, for you, our shareholders, we are securing the success of your company. We don’t want to miss out on any market potential. We will continue to stand firm – but always open to dialogue with decision-makers around the world. We explain the complex mechanisms of our industry, asking: What will the proposed legislation mean in practice? The Board of Management and I are personally engaged in this work.\n\nAt your company, we mostly let our actions speak for themselves: Just as I promised you last year – we already have more than 15 all-electric models on the market. Our BMW iX* has been recently updated, so that it now boasts an electric range of up to 701 kilometres in the WLTP cycle. In 2024, battery-electric vehicles – BEVs, for short – were once again key growth drivers for us. By year-end, more than 17 percent of our total sales were fully electric. This is significantly higher than at many other manufacturers. You’ll also be pleased to hear that this positive trend accelerated into 2025. In the first quarter, our global BEV sales increased over 30 percent. Europe led the way, with growth of more than 60 percent.\n\nThe US market was also up by over 20 percent.\n\nIf you include both BEVs and plug-in hybrids, more than one in four of our vehicles is now electrified, while nearly one in five is already fully-electric. We are making good progress. We are delivering – and maintaining our credibility.\n\nMy second topic for today is our goals.\n\nAs always, they are ambitious. Even in difficult conditions, not every market contracts. There are always regions where growth is possible – and your company exploited this potential to the full in 2024: In three of our four main sales regions, we increased deliveries and often gained market share.\n\nJoy is at the heart of our BMW brand, sparking positive emotions all around.ach of our company’s four brands – BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad – has its own unique character and strengths. BMW remains number one in the premium segment. BMW M also reported dynamic growth, achieving record sales for the 13th consecutive year. Nearly one in ten BMWs sold last year was a profitable M model. The new MINI family is now complete: With five models, three of which are fully electric. The MINI brand not only has a positive impact on our carbon footprint, it also has a strong fan base. In the luxury segment, Rolls-Royce continues to set the benchmark. With the Black Badge Spectre*, a second fully electric Rolls-Royce is now available. The Phantom is the brand's most iconic vehicle. And it is celebrating its 100th birthday this year. All good reasons to expand the Goodwood factory. At over 300 million pounds, this will be our biggest investment in the plant since it opened in 2003. BMW Motorrad impressed once again. Our two-wheeler brand remains the undisputed global number one in the premium motorcycle segment – again reaching a new all-time high, with 210,000 motorcycles and scooters sold. The GS accounts for nearly a third of those sales. It will be joined later this year by the new 1300 Series model family. I like to ride a motorbike myself, so I can assure you that our line-up is our strongest ever.\n\nWe accomplished all this in 2024 – despite the fact that many things unfolded differently than expected, as the year progressed. The delivery stops and recalls associated with an Integrated Brake System IBS component from one of our suppliers had a financial impact – but we responded quickly, keeping our communications transparent.\n\nAt the same time, the Chinese market remained weak and demand for electric vehicles declined in several markets. In light of this, in September 2024, we adjusted our guidance. From that point on, we pushed even harder to keep your company on track. That is another thing that sets us apart. We met our updated targets, with more than 2.45 million vehicles delivered to customers and a Group EBT margin of 7.7 percent.\n\nYou already know that we sold fewer vehicles in China, where competition is intense and prices are increasingly under pressure. It should come as no surprise that domestic manufacturers are expanding their market share. However, BMW remains number one in its segment. China is still our largest single market for electric vehicles, with over 100,000 BEVs delivered to customers there in 2024. Let us not forget that we have enjoyed above-average success in the Chinese market for many years.\n\nWhat is also important: Your company has earned an excellent reputation in China, built on years of market presence and sustained investment. Since 2010, we have invested around 116 billion renminbi in our production base in Shenyang alone. We also have a strong R&D network in China, second only to Germany. I’ve visited China several times over the past few months, including attending the “China Development Forum”, where BMW was the exclusive mobility partner, providing 30 fully-electric BMW i7s* and i5s* for the event. All of us on the Board of Management are regularly on the ground to talk directly with our “BMW Team China”. Our China strategy is based on the principle “in China for China”. The same applies to the NEUE KLASSE. The first models produced for the NEUE KLASSE in China will come off the Shenyang assembly line from 2026. Our design team in Shanghai led development of all China-specific models of the NEUE KLASSE. As a result, our local BMW iX3* will be tailored to the needs of Chinese customers – in other words, “from China for China”.\n\nOur market-specific approach has proved effective over many years. The technology race in our industry will be decided in China – where else? – where AI is widely adopted. That is why we are establishing AI partnerships with leading Chinese tech companies, to integrate these innovations directly into our vehicles in China. For example, we are collaborating with Alibaba to develop the next stage in voice interaction between humans and vehicles. DeepSeek will also be a part of this.\n\nWe will begin integrating DeepSeek’s AI capabilities into our newest models in China by the end of this year. These examples show that, even when it comes to digital applications, we operate “in China, for China” – and at “China speed”. As our largest single market, getting back on track for growth in China is clearly a priority. That is why we are currently consolidating our retail network.\n\nWhat matters most to you, as shareholders, is:\n\nWhat are our plans for 2025?\n\nIn a word: growth. Our sales are forecast to increase slightly. What makes us so confident? Our products. Between now and 2027, BMW will bring more than 40 new or updated vehicles to market across all drive train variants. This year, one of our most successful models will celebrate its 50th anniversary: the BMW 3 Series. The latest version of our extremely popular BMW X3 is fresh on the market. We manufacture the X3 worldwide – in Spartanburg, South Carolina, in the USA; Shenyang, China; and Rosslyn, South Africa. This is a clear example of how we are responding flexibly in an increasingly protectionist environment.\n\nWe are also realigning our sales and marketing to meet the demands of the future. In some markets, an agency model enables customers to move seamlessly between online and offline channels. MINI has already transitioned 15 markets in Europe. The process for our core BMW brand will be significantly more comprehensive, learning from our experience with MINI. We are using this year and next to prepare for the launch of the BMW brand. I’m sure many of you are wondering: What about our retailers? They remain close by our side, of course. The entire transition is taking place in collaboration with them. Anything else would not be the BMW way. Retailers and our BMW branches remain important to our sales success – and, above all, to our customers’ brand experience.\n\nIn uncertain times, making reliable forecasts is not easy. In our guidance for financial year 2025, we responded quickly to current developments, already factoring in the known tariff impacts, as of 12 March 2025. These effects account for approximately one percentage point on the EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment, which we now expect to be within the range of five to seven percent.\n\nGlobal conditions remain dynamic and uncertain. That’s why many OEMs – not only in our industry – are not issuing forecasts at this time. Not us. After the first quarter, we confirmed our guidance.\n\nOur assumptions are based on fundamental premises. We expect developments in the tariff debate by the summer. We are confident that a good compromise can be reached in the negotiations with the US this year. We are closely monitoring developments and actively preparing for a range of scenarios. In the long term, we remain committed to achieving an Automotive EBIT margin with our target range of eight to ten percent.\n\nA key lever for this is lowering operating costs, which we expect to decline in nominal terms over the course of the year.\n\nFor my third point, I’d like to talk about our global footprint.\n\nThe global economy is deeply interconnected, with tightly interwoven supply chains. Can this be undone? We don’t believe so. What we do know is that protectionism leads down a dead-end street. Take modern semiconductors, for instance – which use 60 elements from the periodic table. No single country has all of these. In the end, everyone loses:\n\nProducts become more expensive and less innovative. And who ends up “footing the bill”? The customer, of course.\n\nPunitive tariffs, rising regional isolation, technological decoupling:\n\nHow can we continue to succeed and stay out of geopolitics in such an environment? These are also your top issues as shareholders, which you have shared with us. Today, global reach and appeal are no longer enough. Only companies that are firmly established locally in the regions will remain “in the game”. This is becoming a condition for economic success.\n\nYour company has built this presence in major regions of the world over decades – with production, R&D, sales and marketing and suppliers. We generate added value locally. As a result, we are one of the few truly global players in our industry today – and that gives us a real competitive advantage. Your company has already evolved to the next level, balancing sales and production within our network of global value creation. In other words: In Europe, the US and China, we sold roughly the same number of vehicles, in absolute terms, in 2024, as we produced in each of these regions: about a million cars in Europe, just under 400,000 in the US and around 700,000 in China. No one will be able to replicate this anytime soon.\n\nAnother important asset is our “local-for-local” approach, which we are systematically expanding as local supply chains and collaborations become more important. Take our assembly plants for high-voltage batteries: Five new facilities are currently under construction – all of them close to our production in Europe, the Americas and China. Here, we will manufacture the next generation of high-voltage batteries for our electric vehicles.\n\nOne of these new facilities is being built right around the corner from here, in Irlbach-Straßkirchen. Trade journal “Auto Motor and Sport” reported on this under the headline: \"BMW builds faster than BYD”. You can’t put it more succinctly! In other words, “China speed” – also in Lower Bavaria.\n\nDespite our balanced distribution of sales and production, we will continue to be a major exporter – especially from our domestic market of Germany and our “second home”, the US.\n\nOur roots lie in Munich and Bavaria – and origins come with a responsibility. In 2024, we produced over one million vehicles at our German plants. That’s about a quarter of the country’s total car production. More than half of these vehicles were sold outside the European Union. We are making an important contribution – in Germany and for Germany as a manufacturing location. As I said: Origins come with a responsibility.\n\nWe are carrying this principle forward with the next generation. Right now, on the plant grounds in Munich, we are building a Talent Campus. That name is a promise: a new hub for skills development, serving all 40,000 employees at the Munich location. Talents with various perspectives make us stronger and more innovative. That is, and always will be, our culture at BMW.\n\nThis year, we are celebrating “50 years of BMW North America”. I was in Spartanburg in January to receive an award from Republican Governor Henry McMaster, honouring BMW's 30-year commitment to South Carolina. Its political representatives recognise and appreciate that, without BMW, the region and the state would have taken a very different path.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves: We provide 43,000 jobs in South Carolina – both directly and indirectly. Every second vehicle built at our Spartanburg plant is exported, generating an export value of over ten billion US dollars in 2024 alone. Once again, this made your company the largest automotive exporter in the United States by value. Over the past ten years, our total export value has exceeded 100 billion US dollars. Now, we are investing over 1.7 billion US dollars to bring Spartanburg up to speed for e-mobility. The first e-model from Spartanburg will already roll off the assembly line next year.\n\nAll these figures underline BMW’s economic impact in the United States. We are the only ones with such a extensive production in the US. Our value creation is comprehensive. These are strong arguments that will play a key role in the ongoing tariff negotiations.\n\nLooking at the global picture: With tariffs, it’s currently everyone against everyone else. We advocate for eliminating tariffs altogether: for our industry, based on fair negotiations. That is why we had submitted a widely respected proposal some time ago, calling for a uniform tariff rate of 2.5 percent between Europe and the US. All of this clearly underlines that your company is in a very strong negotiating position – not only in the US, but across all regions. This sets BMW apart from other OEMs. We are in continuous dialogue with decision-makers everywhere: in Brussels, Berlin, Washington, D.C. and Beijing.\n\nIn the European Union, we are taking a firm stance. This includes the EU’s additional tariffs on BEV imports from China. Since October 2024, this has also impacted our electric BMW and MINI models produced in China. We are defending our position and have filed a lawsuit against the European Union, seeking a judicial review of this anti-subsidy measure.\n\nYour company benefits from an integrated global economy. That much is certain. Our position remains unchanged: We stand for open markets and free trade. Growth thrives on openness – not isolation! Period.\n\nMy fourth point is about our future-focused project for tech leadership:\n\nBMW is the NEUE KLASSE – and the NEUE KLASSE is BMW.\n\nThe 1960s were a long time ago. That was when the original Neue Klasse first entered the market, generating strong momentum for BMW's long-term growth. Today, once again, we are setting the course for your company’s success in the decade ahead, guided by the principle:\n\nBMW is the NEUE KLASSE – and the NEUE KLASSE is BMW.\n\nWe do not draw a line between “old” and “new” technology worlds. Every future BMW model will benefit from our technology clusters. The new design language will also be implemented across the entire product range.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is a huge technology kit that enables everything else.\n\nWe are targeting economic advantages through high levels of commonality and economies of scale. Our customers get the latest technology in their vehicles – regardless of which drive train they choose. Now, bear with me, it's about to get a little bit technical: In the NEUE KLASSE, Sheer Driving Pleasure is also about software, such as our BMW Panoramic iDrive. This includes a completely new display system that projects content across the full width of the windscreen. Four high-performance computers control the most important in-car functionalities. These “super brains” deliver up to 20 times more in-vehicle computing power. We have also simplified the new electrical system, with 600 metres less wiring, reduced weight and higher energy efficiency. That’s how we do it in the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nOne of the four high-performance computers is our “Heart of Joy”. All drivetrain and driving dynamics functions are integrated into this electronic control unit. International journalists tested it on the track with our factory driver, Jens Klingmann – in our BMW Vision Driving Experience or VDX for short. This is how is went:\n\nYou can't fake that kind of emotion. That is Sheer Driving Pleasure in its purest form – taken to a whole new dimension in our BMW Vision Driving Experience. The VDX is the most powerful prototype we have ever built. Its key data are quite remarkable: 18,000 Newton meter of torque, a downforce of up to 1.2 tonnes and lateral forces of up to 3 G. That is, three times the acceleration due to gravity. These are the kinds of figures typically only seen in top-tier racing cars. We are testing the physical limits of driving. Why are we doing this? The answer is simple: A system that is capable of managing forces like these can – without question – handle everyday driving with ease.\n\nAt the Auto Shanghai in April, we took things a step further, building our own test track to showcase the VDX, complete with a massive ramp.\n\nIt was spectacular! Our VDX was a hit – and the social media reach was tremendous. Many of the technologies featured in the VDX will also be used in the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nWe are entering the home straight – and we intend to prove that to you, right here, today. For those of you here in the Olympiahalle, please remain in your seats when the vehicles make their entrance in a moment.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, the first two production models of the NEUE KLASSE!\n\nAs you can see, they are still camouflaged – to maintain the suspense just a little bit longer. You are all “practised” BMW shareholders, so I’m sure you’ll recognise the proportions right away: This model is a sporty sedan in the current BMW 3 Series segment. The other is a typical member of the X family, our BMW iX3* – which will be the first representative of the NEUE KLASSE. You could even say it is getting its own plant, since we are producing the iX3 at our new plant in Hungary. We will be opening the Debrecen location this autumn. The sporty sedan for the NEUE KLASSE won't just simply roll off the production line either. Just a short distance from the Olympiahalle is our more than 100-year-old Munich main plant. We are completely refurbishing it for modern industrial production in the heart of the city.\n\nThe second model will ramp up there in 2026. After that, the NEUE KLASSE will be rolled out worldwide across our production network. I would like to invite you all to the IAA MOBILITY here in Munich in September for the world premiere of the BMW iX3 – without camouflage, of course, exactly as it will be available to our customers.\n\nAt BMW, the proverbial glass is never half-empty – it is always at least half-full. We focus on opportunities and pursue them systematically – even in an uncertain environment. BMW will turn 110 next year.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is just one example of how we continue to take bold, forward-looking action. The BMW way is shaped by confidence.\n\nThat’s what our “Team BMW Group” stands for at all our locations worldwide. We never rest on our laurels. Together, we will ensure that your investment remains worthwhile.\n\nAll of us at the company truly appreciate your continued support.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i5 eDrive40 Limousine: Energy consumption combined: 16,3 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2-Emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2-Class: A.

An important chapter in the history of the BMW Group is coming to an end: Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of BMW AG since 2015 and closely associated with the company for nearly four decades, is stepping down from his position, effective today.\n\n“After 38 years, it is time for me to say goodbye to the BMW Group. It has been an honour to be a part of this exceptional company. I would like to thank all our associates, shareholders and stakeholders for your trust and support,” said Reithofer. “Together, we have overcome tremendous challenges and celebrated unparalleled successes. I firmly believe that the BMW Group will continue to follow its own, unique BMW path.”\n\nDr. Reithofer has held various managerial positions at the company since 1 October 1987, starting out as head of Maintenance Planning. From March 2000, he served as a member of the Board of Management, responsible for the Production division. In September 2006, Reithofer was appointed Chairman of the Board of Management, taking over from Helmut Panke. In May 2015, he succeeded Prof. Joachim Milberg as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe BMW Group’s success in recent decades is inseparable from the efforts of Dr. Reithofer. The extensive tribute to Reithofer's achievements at the 105th Annual General Meeting of BMW AG reflected this.\n\nStefan Quandt, Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board of BMW AG honoured Reithofer’s outstanding service to the company: “On behalf of my family and all our shareholders, I would like to thank you for your outstanding entrepreneurial achievements, which have brought the company to the position it is in today. I can say with absolute conviction: It is truly the end of an era.”\n\nFar-reaching vision,international growth and electromobility\n\nDuring his tenure as Chairman of the Board of Management, Reithofer paved the way for the company’s long-term success with Strategy “Number ONE”, which laid the foundation for the BMW Group’s international growth. Under his leadership, the company successfully navigated the 2008/09 global financial crisis, becoming the world’s leading premium manufacturer and continuing to expand its position.\n\nWith far-reaching vision, Reithofer launched the BMW i electromobility brand, accelerated digitalisation and played a key role in driving international expansion, particularly in the growth market of China. He established sustainability and resource efficiency as key elements of the BMW Group's corporate strategy early on.\n\nOliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, emphasised Reithofer’s significance to the BMW Group as a whole: “Dr. Reithofer is a major architect of the BMW Group’s success today. During his time as Chairman of the Board of Management, he elevated all the company's relevant key figures to a new level. As Chairman of the Supervisory Board, he always served as a valuable source of momentum and guidance, supporting the work of the Board of Management in a constructive, critical and motivating way. His successful efforts will continue to shape the course of the company well beyond the end of his tenure.”\n\nBMW AG extends its sincere thanks to Dr. Reithofer for his visionary leadership, tireless commitment and entrepreneurial, pioneering spirit.\n\nSupervisory Board sets course for continuity at the company\n\nAs Reithofer's successor, the Supervisory Board proposed Dr. Nicolas Peter for election to the Supervisory Board of BMW AG at the Annual General Meeting and, subject to his election, supported the proposal to appoint him as Chairman of the Supervisory Board following the Annual General Meeting 2025.\n\nDr. Nicolas Peter served as the BMW AG Board of Management member responsible for the Finance division from January 2017 to May 2023. He has extensive experience in the automotive industry, combined with many years in a wide range of management positions at the BMW Group.\n\nDr. Peter has not held any position within BMW AG since 11 May 2023 and has therefore completed the two-year cooling-off period required by the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nSebastian Keßler, Communications BMW Group, Strategy\n\nDr. Dominic Stoiber, Communications BMW Group, Strategy\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann, head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe economic success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. Sustainability is a key element of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy and covers all products from the supply chain and production to the end of their useful life."}

While the first year featured a single car on display outside the venue, 2023 marked the debut of the VIP shuttle service with six BMW i7 models wrapped in designs by Swedish-Estonian artist Siiri Jüris (Galleri Duerr). In 2024, seven vehicles – BMW i5 Sedans and i7 models –featured works by Swedish artist Katrin Westman (GSA Gallery). This year, Gregor Hildebrandt continues the tradition, bringing his art the streets of Stockholm with a fleet of seven vehicles.\n\nHildebrandt’s work, “Letztes Jahr in Marienbad, 2022”, was originally created for an exhibition at Atelierele Malmaison in Bucharest and is inspired by the 1961 film of the same name by director Alain Resnais. The artwork incorporates a VHS recording of the film’s first third and explores themes of memory and motion.\n\n\"For me, this is a fantastic opportunity to create a kinetic sculpture in a public space,\" said Hildebrandt. \"I envisioned the film’s fragmented narrative driving through Stockholm as a way to merge the past and the present in a mobile form.\"\n\nHildebrandt, represented by Avlskarl Gallery at Market Art Fair 2025, is celebrated for his innovative use of materials such as cassette tapes and vinyl records, which he transforms into paintings, sculptures, and installations. His work resonates with the transient nature of memory and movement.\n\n50 Years of BMW Art Cars This year’s partnership also celebrates a milestone in BMW’s cultural legacy: the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection. Since 1975, 20 artists, including Alexander Calder, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jeff Koons, have transformed BMW vehicles into “rolling sculptures”. In honor of this occasion, four iconic BMW Art Cars will be showcased in Sweden for the first during the fair:\n\nAlexander Calder: BMW 3.0 CSL (1975) Roy Lichtenstein: BMW 320 Group 5 (1977) Andy Warhol: BMW M1 Group 4 (1979) Jeff Koons: BMW M3 GT2 (2010)\n\nThe collection of 20 BMW Art Cars now forms the essence of the company's global cultural engagement, which encompasses over one hundred initiatives in the fields of contemporary art, music, film and design. To celebrate the 50th anniversary, the BMW Art Car World Tour is a programme of exhibitions on all five continents, accompanied by numerous events. Following stops at Art Basel in Hong Kong, the Shanghai Motor Show and Art Dubai, the tour will visit the BMW Museum in Munich and Contemporary Istanbul, among others.\n\n\"For BMW, the combination of art and mobility has always been a passion,\" said Johanna Kriisa, Managing Director of BMW Sweden. \"This fourth year of partnership with Market Art Fair brings together art history, contemporary creativity, and the future of electrification. With the BMW Art Cars, Gregor Hildebrandt’s mobile artwork, and our fully electric shuttles, we are offering visitors a truly unique experience.\"\n\nA global stage for Nordic art Market Art Fair 2025 is a landmark event in its own right. Historically focused on Scandinavian galleries, this year marks the fair’s first international expansion, welcoming exhibitors from across the globe. A distinguished selection committee of Nordic museum directors and curators ensures that the fair maintains its reputation for bold artistic visions and curatorial excellence.\n\nFor the first time, Market Art Fair will take over the entire Liljevalchs building, including Gert Wingårdh’s striking 2021 modernist extension, Liljevalchs+. This iconic venue, nestled on Djurgården’s serene island park, provides the perfect setting for the fair’s dynamic program of discovery, dialogue, and dealmaking.\n\nSara Berner Bengtsson, Director and CEO of Market Art Fair, said: \"For 50 years, BMW’s pioneering work at the intersection of art and innovation, has transformed vehicles into canvases that carry artistic visions across cities and cultures. This legacy aligns with Market Art Fair’s mission to champion bold creativity and collaborations that bridge disciplines and inspire fresh perspectives. BMW’s longstanding commitment to artists mirrors our belief in art’s transformative power, and we’re proud to celebrate this milestone with them. We can’t wait to see Gregor Hildebrandt’s striking designs animating Stockholm’s streets—art and motion in true BMW style. Here’s to many more years of driving creativity forward.\"\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan: Electric power consumption, combined in WLTP cycle: 20,6 – 18,2 kWh/100 km.

As part of the mobility partnership between BMW München and FC Bayern München Basketball, BMW Welt hosted the “World of Basketball” last Saturday. More than 11,000 sports fans and visitors experienced a vibrant and action-packed basketball festival that lasted well into the evening. The highlight of the event was a 3x3 tournament in the completely redesigned auditorium, with the court as its centrepiece. Six teams, consisting of former professionals and personalities from the streetball scene, played thrilling matches for a good cause. Before that, the stars of the reigning champions, FC Bayern Basketball, took time for a meet & greet with their fans and received their new, all-electric “company vehicles”.\n\nThe partnership slogan was once again brought to life at the subsequent 3x3 tournament. DJs and displayed urban art exhibits provided the perfect setting and vibes for the action-packed yet friendly sports event.\n\nSix teams participated, each required to include at least one female player and led by captains: Team FC Bayern Basketball by club legend Steffen Hamann, Team Thatboii led by DJ and designer Chelo, Team Magenta Sport featuring former national player Per Günther, Team Obvs led by model and event organiser Nik Mosch, Team InYourFace with podcasters John Angulo and Bastian Doreth, and Team Beats N Buckets led by rapper Jalil and author/event organiser Philipp “Dembo” Dembowski.\n\nThe packed auditorium witnessed thrilling and exciting basketball. One of the many highlights was the buzzer-beater by which Magenta Sport defeated Obvs in the semifinals. The Per Günther-led team also prevailed in the final against Team FCBB, but the real winners were everyone who came to BMW Welt and celebrated \"World of Basketball.\" The children and teenagers supported by DEIN MÜNCHEN for fair starting conditions and a self-determined life also felt like winners. Each team had chosen a specific project from DEIN MÜNCHEN for which BMW München donated 10 euros per point scored by the respective team. A total of 377 points were scored, and BMW München rounded up the total donation to 5,000 euros, distributing the “bonus” evenly across all projects.

The impressive streak in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) continued at Laguna Seca (USA). Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the BMW M Team RLL #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 once again was the fastest man in qualifying. He claimed his and teammate Philipp Eng’s (AUT) fourth pole position in as many races this season. In the race itself, the #24 car battled for victory right up to the end and secured third place after a dramatic finish. This marks the second podium of the IMSA season for Vanthoor/Eng, following their result at Long Beach (USA). In the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8, Marco Wittmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) also delivered a strong performance, taking fourth place – their best result of the season so far.\n\nAt the start of the two-hour and 40-minute race, Vanthoor maintained the lead and held a several-second advantage over the field for the first 50 minutes. Only when lapped traffic began to factor in were the chasing cars able to close the gap, kicking off a tight battle for the top three. After a late first pit stop, Eng rejoined the race in third place with car #24. Both he and later Vanthoor managed to stay close to the leading two Porsches. In a tense and uninterrupted final phase without any full course yellows to neutralise the field, the outcome remained wide open. Vanthoor was only a few tenths of a second behind in third place, waiting for his opportunity to attack. In a dramatic fight for the win, he was touched in the final corner and spun off the track. Nonetheless, Vanthoor was able to get the #24 car going again and cross the finish line in third.\n\nIn the sister car #25, van der Linde and Wittmann also confirmed the competitiveness of the BMW M Hybrid V8. Starting from sixth on the grid, they pursued an alternate strategy and made an early first pit stop, which initially dropped them further down the field. However, after around 90 minutes of racing, Wittmann climbed from seventh to fourth within just a few laps. The #25 ultimately crossed the line right behind its sibling car, rounding off a strong showing for BMW M Team RLL with fourth place.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT3 EVO crews faced a tough race at Laguna Seca. In the GTD-Pro class, Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) took fifth place in the #48 car from Paul Miller Racing. Their teammates Madison Snow and Neil Verhagen (both USA) were tenth in the #1 car. In the GTD class, the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Turner Motorsport, driven by Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA), finished ninth.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The race weekend at Laguna Seca confirmed that we’ve continued to close the gap and are now fighting for top positions with the performance of our BMW M Hybrid V8. Dries Vanthoor taking the fourth consecutive pole position was sensational. Sheldon van der Linde in car #25 was also quick and secured sixth place in a very tight qualifying session. Both cars delivered a strong performance in the race as well. In a race shaped in part by strategy, the team and drivers executed a flawless collective effort. It was extremely intense right up to the final corner, and we were fighting for the win. In the end, Dries Vanthoor and Philipp Eng secured their second consecutive podium, and Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann achieved their best result of the season so far with fourth place, finishing right behind. The trend is clearly upward, and now we’ll continue working hard to take that final step and reward everyone’s hard work with a victory.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 3rd place): “I think P3 was almost the maximum we could have achieved today. The Porsches were again strong but we had a good race, the team did a great job. We did the best we could. That I was pushed off in the last corner was unfortunate. It was a racing incident, even though I think it was unnecessary. We still have work to do but having had two podiums in two races is a very nice achievement, but we just want more after the qualifying achievements and win a race.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 3rd place): “It was a very exciting race and a very good weekend overall. Qualifying again was great from Dries and the entire team. The race was tricky but good fun. P3 is another good result but of course we wanted to get the victory. We had the pace and the package but in the end it didn’t quite work out. We will just work harder from here. Thanks to the whole team.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “It was a difficult weekend for us, we had some issues in FP2 and qualifying. We tried to fix them for the race but went a bit blind into the race. Nevertheless we made some good progress, gained a couple of positions, had some good fights and good fun out there. Obviously the aim was to step on the podium which was not in our reach here though. We were lacking the pace a bit which we have to investigate. Still we can be fairly happy with how the race went and with P4 considering how the weekend went. Now we need to look into the data and find some performance for the next races. Then the aim is to bring both cars on the podium and ideally chase the win.”"}

The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend. At the third round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the home round for BMW M Team WRT, the “6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps,” both BMW M Hybrid V8s once again demonstrated their potential following the podium finish in Imola (ITA). This time, however, it went unrewarded. The #20 Hypercar was in the fight for another podium finish until shortly before the end. A slow puncture set the car back before it had to retire for safety reasons due to a brake issue. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 also showed strong performance, but, after an eventful six hours, it was only enough for tenth place.\n\nWith perfect spring weather and an impressive crowd of nearly 100,000 spectators over the weekend, the stage was set for an exciting FIA WEC race. Each of the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars was driven by a duo instead of the usual trio. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) drove the #15, while René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) shared driving duties in the #20. Their teammates Dries Vanthoor (BEL) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) are competing this weekend with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nAt the start, Magnussen sprinted from 11th on the grid into the top five with the #15 before handing over to Marciello. In the eventful race that followed, with several safety car periods, the car, however, was set back by two drive-through penalties. Rast initially ran outside the top ten in the #20, but he and Frijns made steady progress thanks to a strong performance and good strategy. Frijns eventually pushed the BMW M Hybrid V8 into podium contention with bold moves. But half an hour before the end, he had to return to the pits due to brake problems, and the team decided not to send the car back out.\n\nEven though the race outcome did not meet expectations, BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team WRT gathered valuable data in preparation for the season highlight – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The endurance classic at the Sarthe will be held as the fourth round of the 2025 FIA WEC on 14th /15th June.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the crews of both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs had a difficult weekend. Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), who had narrowly missed out on victory in Imola with a second-place finish, came ninth in class with the Team WRT #46 car. The race ended early for the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO during the second hour. Following contact, damage occurred in the suspension area, and the trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS) had to retire.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “If you look at the race result alone, it’s obviously not what we had hoped for here at the home race for BMW M Team WRT. Also given the performance we showed with both BMW M Hybrid V8s, we had expected more in the end. It was frustrating that car number 15 received two penalties. That, unfortunately, set the car back, and it was difficult to fight for a top result after that. Car number 20 was very strong throughout the entire race. It was great to see that we were once again able to fight for top positions and were back on course for the podium. Unfortunately, we first had a slow puncture and then a brake issue that we still need to examine more closely. For safety reasons, we decided to retire the car. So, our conclusion is: the performance was there again, but, of course, we also want to achieve the corresponding results. In the LMGT3 class, the outcome was also not what we had hoped for after the strong race in Imola. Unfortunately, car number 31 retired early after contact. Car number 46 did a race without mistakes, but, unfortunately, the performance wasn’t enough today to fight for the front. We will continue working and are now looking forward to Le Mans. There, we want to show our full strength again and be at the very front.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A disappointing weekend overall. At some stages, it looked like we could fight for a podium, but, in the end, that wasn’t the case. Car #20 was forced to retire due to what looks like brake issues. We will investigate further. As for car #15, two drive-through penalties made it impossible to aim for a stronger result. Ferrari had the race under control, and there wasn’t much we could do to challenge them. In LMGT3, it was also a tough outcome. Car #31 retired early after being involved in an incident, which was very disappointing. With car #46, we maximised what we could with the pace we had, but it wasn't enough to fight for the podium. We took a strategic gamble, but, unfortunately, it didn’t pay off. We’ll analyse, we’ll learn, and we’ll come back stronger.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 10th place): “It was unfortunate to get the two drive–through penalties. Apart from that, we had a strong start to the race. We showed a decent form, but then we were just fighting to make up from the two penalties. But it has been a good effort from the whole team. The other car also showed great performance, fighting all the way up to the top. Unfortunately there was no reward.”\n\nRobin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “I think it was an exciting race overall. The start wasn’t ideal, but we recovered well and made our way forward. Our pace was decent, even though we were not the fastest in the field, but we made smart strategy calls that kept us in the mix. On my side, there was some proper racing, with elbows out! Unfortunately, we had to retire due to a brake issue towards the end, which is a real shame as a podium was definitely within reach. But that’s racing.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 9th place LMGT3 class): “We finished P9. That reflects our potential this weekend, given the pace we had. It was still a good race overall: we fought hard in the beginning of the race, we gained positions and even battled for the podium. Unfortunately, a drive-through penalty set us back, and we took a strategic gamble to try and move up the order, knowing we couldn’t gain much on outright pace. In the end, it didn’t play out in our favour. We’ll keep pushing and hope to be more competitive next time.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF LMGT3 class): “It’s disappointing to come away with zero points. The incident with Yasser was unfortunate and not how we wanted our race to end. The team always put in so much hard work and effort and I wish we could reward them. Hopefully next time, at Le Mans, we will do just that.”"}

The exhibition “KAIROS / Hauntological Variations” (10 May to 12 October 2025) is the largest survey exhibition of Julie Mehretu's work in Germany to date. Nearly 100 works express the full range of her artistic practice, from her early, urban-inspired line drawings of the 1990s to her most recent, spectacular abstract paintings. Among the works on display is the maquette of the BMW Art Car #20 designed by Julie Mehretu in 2024, which is part of the renowned BMW Art Car Collection celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.\n\nThe Ethiopian-American artist Julie Mehretu is one of the most influential painters working today. Known for her immersive large-scale paintings reflecting on world politics, Mehretu has exhibited in the most prestigious biennials and museums throughout the world. Mehretu’s work uses source materials that mark pivotal political events and historical sites. Through techniques like brushwork, line drawing, airbrush painting, and screen printing, these once-familiar images are transformed into abstract compositions. Through these abstractions, places and moments that define recent history—whether the Grenfell Tower fire in London or Saddam Hussein’s destroyed palace in Baghdad—are pictured, dissected, atomized and interrogated.\n\n“KAIROS / Hauntological Variations” features 25 paintings that measure up to 7.5 meters wide, range in date from 2001 to 2023, and show the chronological development of Mehretu’s work. The exhibition further dives into Mehretu’s conceptual thinking, showcasing works on paper and source material, which is exhibited alongside her works for the first time here. Also presented is time-based media made by Mehretu’s peers inspired by her practice: the documentary “Palimpsest” (2021), capturing Mehretu in her studio; a video work by filmmaker Trevor Tweeten based on the album “Promises” (2021) by Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra; and an album by jazz musician Jason Moran.\n\nJulie Mehretu artistically designed the 20th BMW Art Car in 2024, she developed the foiling for the BMW M Hybrid V8 as a remix of her painting ‘Everywhen’. Her idea was for the vehicle to go through the painting and be affected by it. Over the next two years, Mehretu will be working with the BMW Group to organise the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), a network for young filmmakers in five African countries. For the first time in the history of the iconic collection, an artist is developing an Art Car that goes far beyond the car as a pure art object. The maquette of the BMW Art Car can be seen in the exhibition and a film programme later in the year will show contributions by the artists involved in AFMAC.The exhibition takes place in the anniversary year of the BMW Art Car Collection: in 1975, the iconic collection celebrates its 50th anniversary with the BMW Art Car World Tour, a concerted exhibition programme of the 20 rolling sculptures worldwide.\n\nMehretu's artistic careerMehretu was born in 1970 in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa and fled with her family to Michigan, USA, in 1977 after the beginning of the military dictatorship under Mengistu Haile Mariam. There she began her art studies at Kalamazoo College in the late 1980s, spent a year at the Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, Senegal, and received her Master of Fine Arts degree from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 1997. Interrupted by working stays in Berlin and artist residencies in various parts of the United States, Mehretu has lived and worked in New York since the late 1990s.\n\nInfluenced by her experiences of flight and migration, Mehretu’s art has from the very beginning explored the upheavals and contradictions of history. In this context, she describes the large-scale works she has been making since the late 1990s as “story maps of no location.” Borrowing from the visual language of cartography, they are palimpsest-like, overall compositions composed of many layers of ink and acrylic paint. As is readily apparent in works such as Rise of the New Suprematists (2001) and Black City (2007), the lower layers consist of fragmentarily composed topographies and cityscapes. Without identifying a specific location, the structures are based on historical, contemporary, and utopian architecture. They refer to buildings as sites of historical action and, for Mehretu, symbolize the power of dominant politics. Above them, in swarm-like formations, are the fine dots and lines of Mehretu’s drawing vocabulary. The arrangement of these so-called “characters” (beings, figures, signs) is analogous to the ever-changing economic, social, and political events of the world. Accentuated by explosions, smoke, and vortex-like structures, they suggest dramatic upheavals. The result is highly complex, layered imagery that makes the processes of over-writing history between past and future legible and tangible.\n\nFrom 2012 until todaySince the 2010s, Mehretu’s work has undergone a significant aesthetic transformation. Initially, the backgrounds turned gray, with increasingly expressive markings covering more and more of the surface. In works such as “Conjured Parts (tongues)” (2015), the line drawings in the background disappear in favor of spray-painted forms of heavily manipulated, blurred photographs. These are appropriated from widespread media images associated with the rise of authoritarianism and white supremacy, the cruelty of civil wars and ethnic conflicts, catastrophic climate change, and emancipatory movements. They often show the vulnerability of people in the face of violence, but also their impressive capacity for resistance. If such images from Mehretu’s archive, which has been steadily growing since the 1990s, once influenced the dynamics of individual formations on the upper layers of her works, they now provide the guiding material for her completely abstract compositions that fill the canvas. As vividly illustrated in works such as “Sun Ship (J.C.)” (2018), “Desire was our breastplate” (2022–23), and “TRANSpainting (recurrence)” (2023), Mehretu continually incorporates new colors and various painting and printing techniques. The resulting images often resemble calligraphy, graffiti, and even cave paintings, and where language reaches its limits, she processes scenes from world events into “visual neologisms.”\n\nThe source for Mehretus' workIn Düsseldorf, a selection of the source material that Mehretu has been collecting since the mid-1990s and that serves as the basis for her works is being shown for the first time in an exhibition. The “Archive Pages” (1997), also on view in the exhibition, make clear that this archive material functions as a guiding atlas for her painterly gestures and signs. This series consists of fifty-seven photocopied images, some of which Mehretu has annotated with her “characters”—a deliberately reduced sign language consisting, among other things, of crosses, dots, and dashes. As drawn precursors and miniatures, twenty early works on paper also illustrate how Mehretu’s large paintings developed layer by layer from the drawing. The comprehensive exhibition at K21 also includes a selection of Mehretu’s monotypes. The forty-six sheets illustrate how the versatile medium of printmaking is a constant field of experimentation for expanding her painterly repertoire.\n\nLast year, after a long period of planning, two prestigious major projects were announced. Mehretu designed a more than twenty-five-meter-high window for the Obama Presidential Center and created the twentieth BMW Art Car. Her work has been exhibited at, among others, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Hayward Gallery in London, the Louisiana Museum in Humblebaek, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and the Mori Art-Museum in Tokyo. She has also been represented at the Venice, São Paulo, Busan, Sydney, and Gwanju biennials, as well as dOCUMENTA (13), and has received major honors such as the MacArthur Award and the Medal of Arts Award.\n\nFollowing exhibitions at the Kunstverein Hannover in 2007 and the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin in 2009, the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen is proud to present KAIROS / Hauntological Variations, Mehretu’s first institutional solo exhibition in Germany in over fifteen years. Featuring works from nearly thirty years, the exhibition demonstrates how, as a painter, she relentlessly counteracts every crisis with her inventive spirit.\n\nThe exhibition is curated by Susanne Gaensheimer, Director of Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, and Sebastian Peter, Assistant Curator.\n\nPress Preview: May 8, 11 am Press Conference: May 8, 12 pm\n\nOpening Friday, May 9, 7 – 10 pm, free entry Artist Talk at 8 pm: Julie Mehretu in conversation with Kimberly Bradley (art critic, editor, and educator)\n\nFurther information on the exhibition's supporting programme can be found here.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}

Like many sectors of the global economy, we are adjusting to a new reality – one in which abrupt changes in external conditions often have far-reaching consequences, not just for our industry.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is critical not to get caught up in the public frenzy or rush into hasty actions. That is why we continue to focus on our long-term strategic course with pragmatism and flexibility.\n\nAnd this approach is proving its value: Despite the volatile conditions, the BMW Group has started 2025 in line with our expectations.\n\nThere are three main reasons for this:\n\nFirst, our fresh and attractive product line-up across all drive technologies – which helped us achieve a robust performance, especially in Europe and the US.\n\nSecond, continued strong sales growth for our all-electric vehicles.\n\nAnd, third, a high standard of cost discipline across the company.\n\nAll of this meant that, despite various influencing factors, our profitability for the first quarter was in the upper half of our guidance.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the details:\n\nIn all major sales regions outside of China, we increased our sales, compared to the same period of last year. Excluding China, sales grew by almost six percent (5.9%).\n\nThis confirms the effectiveness not only of our product strategy, but also of our technology-open approach. Our vehicles are in demand, across all types of drivetrain.\n\nWe saw particularly good growth in Europe and the US – with sales in Europe up solidly by more than six percent and an increase of four percent in the US.\n\nWe are growing steadily across the entire Americas region, with growth of over 5 percent. We are also growing overall in our markets outside Europe, America, and China by 15 percent. Thanks to our strong performance in other markets, we were able to nearly offset the persistent challenges in the Chinese market.\n\nWe have the right products on the market at the right time. Our wide range of all-electric vehicles across all brands allows us to take full advantage of the growing demand for pure electric vehicles.\n\nThe more than 32-percent increase in BEV sales underlines the strong appeal of our electric vehicles. Above all, high demand in Europe fuelled this growth in BEVs. Here, sales of fully-electric vehicles climbed by more than 64 percent year-on-year. E-mobility “made by BMW” is also gaining popularity in the US, with sales up by more than 23 percent.\n\nNearly one in five vehicles sold by the BMW Group is now fully-electric.\n\nThe total share of electrified vehicles – that is, pure electric cars plus plug-in hybrids – now exceeds 25 percent.\n\nMINI, in particular, is benefiting from the strong demand for all-electric vehicles. Today, an electric heart beats in one out of every three vehicles built by the brand. With all models of the New MINI Family now fully available, the brand recorded sales growth of four percent. In China, locally-built electric models played a key role in the brand’s growth of over 18 percent.\n\nThe share of fully-electric vehicles in total sales is especially important for meeting European CO2 targets. In 2024, the BMW Group once again significantly outperformed its European CO2 fleet target. Based on internal calculations, our numbers came in at under 100 grammes per kilometre in the WLTP cycle for the first time. We are confident that we will meet the original legal requirements this year as well.\n\nIn addition to the growth in all-electric vehicles, we also benefited from continued high demand for our sporty BMW M models – with sales up 5 percent in the first quarter. High-performance models such as the two BMW M5* variants and the BMW M3* were the main growth drivers.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe first quarter of 2025 highlighted our company’s ability to seize opportunities in a challenging environment and to successfully defend our position in the marketplace.\n\nLooking ahead, new orders across all drive technologies give us every reason for confidence – especially in Germany, where we are seeing significant growth.\n\nNevertheless, 2025 remains a year of high volatility. We are closely monitoring developments and preparing for different scenarios. This will enable us to respond flexibly and quickly to changing circumstances. We remain firmly committed to deliver robust results and to meet our ambitious annual targets.\n\nFree trade and international cooperation are important drivers of growth and progress. They have always guided our actions. In trade conflicts, on the other hand, nobody wins. All sides should therefore avoid a spiral of isolation and trade barriers, and instead promote growth, progress and innovation worldwide.\n\nWe are advocating for this at various political levels in our markets. Thanks to our international footprint and strong, long-term commitment in various countries, we enjoy a high level of credibility. That is why people listen to us attentively and our arguments are well received.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIt is especially important in challenging times that we continually assess the situation in our markets and regions. That is why I have spent significant time in the past few months gathering information about the situation on the ground in our most important markets.\n\nJust two weeks ago, I was at Auto Shanghai. This trade show provides a valuable indicator for current trends – especially for the Chinese market.\n\nOne of the highlights was the world premiere of our BMW Vision Driving Experience, or VDX for short. This is the most powerful development prototype BMW has ever built. The key data speaks for itself:\n\nThese are the kind of numbers you usually only see in top-of-the-range racing cars.\n\nThe VDX is a pure test vehicle, designed to push the limits of driving physics. However, many of its technologies will be used in our NEUE KLASSE.\n\nIn particular, the VDX showcases the performance capabilities of our “Heart of Joy” – one of four high-performance computers that will control key functionalities, such as driving dynamics, automated driving and infotainment in our NEUE KLASSE.\n\nThe “Heart of Joy” clusters all drivetrain and driving dynamics functions in a single, standardised electronic control unit. In combination with our dynamic performance control system – which was developed entirely in-house – we are redefining the BMW brand’s most fundamental core characteristic.\n\nWe are creating “the next level of Sheer Driving Pleasure”.\n\nWe demonstrated exactly what this means with an incredible live performance in Shanghai. For this purpose, we built our own test track with a massive ramp.\n\nThe public and trade press were more than impressed with the performance and possibilities unleashed when we combine our decades of experience in driving dynamics with cutting-edge control technology. This is something only we at BMW can do.\n\nOur customers will benefit directly from this – because a system that can manage forces like these can also handle everyday operations with ease: not just in terms of agility and driving stability, but also efficiency and comfort.\n\nTowards the end of the year, series production of the NEUE KLASSE will begin at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary – starting with the BMW iX3*, which will celebrate its world premiere at the IAA MOBILITY in Munich.\n\nAfter that, the rollout will continue in rapid succession. In 2026, production of a sporty sedan at the heart of the BMW brand will get underway at our main plant in Munich.\n\nWe are deliberately launching the NEUE KLASSE in high-volume segments, so that our innovations can immediately have a broad impact.\n\nBetween now and 2027, we will release more than 40 new or updated BMW models onto the market – from BEVs, to plug-in hybrids, to vehicles with combustion engines. All of these will benefit from the technologies of the NEUE KLASSE – and, of course, from the new design language as well.\n\nNo other manufacturer has a project as comprehensive and ground-breaking as ours ready for production.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWith its broad product portfolio across all brands, its technology-open approach and highly flexible production network, the BMW Group is in an excellent position to exploit growth opportunities as they arise.\n\nThanks to our global footprint, we are also able to respond quickly to changes in individual regions, as well as challenges around the world.\n\nWe will continue to build on these typical BMW strengths in future.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Limousine: energy consumption combined: 26,8 kWh/100 km and 1,9 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions eighted combined: 43 g/km (WLTP); CO2 class: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B BMW M5 Touring: energy consumption weighted combined: 27,6 kWh/100 km and 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B BMW M3 Competition Limousine mit M xDrive: energy consumption combined: 10,2–10,1 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions combined: 230–228 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: G BMW iX1 eDrive20: energy consumption combined: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2 class: A"}

With a balanced presence in our sales regions, we have a strong competitive position and are able to deliver a consistent performance.\n\nIn the first quarter, the BMW Group proved this once again.\n\nSLIDE 3: BMW Group Performance in Q1 2025\n\nLet’s take a detailed look into the key figures for the first quarter.\n\nGroup earnings before tax totalled over 3.1 billion euros.\n\nBased on Group revenues of 33.8 billion euros, this resulted in a Group EBT margin of 9.2 percent.\n\nThe EBIT margin in the Automotive segment came in at the upper end of our 2025 annual target corridor with 6.9 percent.\n\nExcluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the margin was 8.1 percent.\n\nGlobal retail sales decreased slightly by 1.4 percent compared to last year’s first quarter.\n\nSales of all-electric vehicles increased by 32.4 percent, which represents a share of 18.7 percent of total sales.\n\nSLIDE 4: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nHere you can see how the Automotive Segment performed across key metrics.\n\nIn the first quarter, the BMW Group delivered just over 586,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers, a slight decrease of 1.4 percent compared to last year’s first quarter.\n\nWhile the BMW brand was slightly down 2 percent year-on-year, the MINI brand benefited from the full availability of all models and reported a growth of 4.1 percent.\n\nGroup sales grew across all regions except China.\n\nHere, the lower run-rate of the second half of 2024 has carried over into the first quarter of 2025, as expected.\n\nThe sales development in the Chinese market in Q1 was also impacted by the model changeover of our important BMW X3 and operational challenges in certain areas of the dealer network.\n\nIn Europe, the BMW Group increased retail sales solidly by 6.2 percent.\n\nThe order intake for BMW vehicles in the region across our entire product portfolio is strong, with an order bank reaching well into the third quarter.\n\nIn particular, BEV retail sales grew by 64.2 percent in Europe, confirming the region’s crucial role in driving our electrification strategy.\n\nIn the US, year-on-year retail sales grew by 4 percent.\n\nOur commitment to electrification remains an important cornerstone of our strategy. And the demand for our all-electric vehicles remains strong.\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered almost 110,000 all-electric vehicles to customers worldwide, representing a significant growth of almost a third (32.4 percent).\n\nThe share of our all-electric vehicles amounted to 18.7 percent of total sales.\n\nOur electrified vehicles – meaning BEVs and plug-in hybrids –accounted for almost 27 percent of total sales.\n\nAutomotive Segment revenues amounted to 29.2 billion euros and were moderately lower than in the same quarter of 2024, mainly due to lower vehicle sales to dealers.\n\nSegment EBIT for the first three months was 2 billion euros, with an EBIT margin of 6.9 percent.\n\nLet’s now have a detailed look at the year-on-year changes in the operational result on the next slide.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q1\n\nAuto EBIT declined by around 700 million euros compared to the first quarter of 2024.\n\nChanges in currency and raw material positions accounted for a positive impact of around 100 million euros.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model-mix and pricing effects was a headwind of 900 million euros compared to the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe pricing headwind compared to Q1 2024 reflects the global price environment and especially the challenges of the highly competitive Chinese market.\n\nIn China, the price levels of the second half of 2024 continued into the first quarter, as expected.\n\nAccordingly, Q1 revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment were below the level of Q1 2024.\n\nFor the full year, they are expected to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nI emphasized at our Annual Conference that for the year 2025, not only R&D expenditure and capex, but also operational costs will decrease compared to 2024.\n\nOur Q1 results provide first evidence for this cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation.\n\nResearch and development expenses were around 200 million euros lower than in Q1 2024.\n\nBased on Group R&D expenditure, the R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code came in at 5.9 percent.\n\nSales and administrative expenses also decreased year-on-year by about 200 million euros, mainly due to lower IT costs.\n\nIn Other Cost Changes, the headwind of 300 million euros essentially results from two topics:\n\nThe other tariff increases only started to come into effect from early March and therefore had minimal impact on the Q1 results.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q1\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled about 400 million euros in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nSegment EBT amounted to 1.9 billion euros, which is 800 million euros lower than in the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe net change in working capital contributed around 100 million euros to free cashflow.\n\nInventories rose during the first quarter, as production exceeded retail sales and wholesale volumes.\n\nWhile this is typical first quarter seasonality, this year’s Q1 stock increase is much less pronounced than in previous years.\n\nThe impact of increased inventories as well as of higher trade receivables was compensated by the development of trade payables, which increased also due to higher production levels.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cashflow by 600 million euros.\n\nThis includes a positive component with invest lower than depreciation in the first quarter.\n\nOn the other hand, it also incorporates a higher cash outflow of 964 million euros in Q1, which is related to the capex peak in the last quarter of 2024.\n\nCapital expenditure for January to March amounted to around 1.2 billion euros, a year-on year reduction of around 100 million euros.\n\nThe capex ratio for the first quarter was 3.6 percent.\n\nFor the full year 2025, capex will decrease compared to 2024, with an expected capex ratio below 6 percent.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 200 million euros.\n\nThe change in the position other, which includes regular tax payments, led to a reduction in free cashflow of around 800 million euros.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cashflow above 5 billion euros in the Automotive segment.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Automotive net financial assets came in at 45.5 billion euros, which is around the same level as at the end of 2024.\n\nThis provides a solid foundation to navigate the current challenges in global markets.\n\nAnd it enables us to distribute our Automotive Free Cashflow via dividends and share buybacks.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains committed to its shareholder return strategy, which includes both dividend payments and share buybacks.\n\nOn April 3rd, we successfully concluded the fourth and final tranche of our second share buyback program.\n\nWith completion of this program, we have repurchased shares valued at 4 billion euros since the start of our share-buyback authorization in 2022.\n\nThis corresponds to a reduction in share capital of over 7 percent.\n\nAt the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG will propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nSLIDE 7: Financial Services Segment in Q1\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nThe number of new contracts concluded with retail customers decreased slightly by 4.6 percent year-on-year to reach almost 403,000 contracts.\n\nFor new vehicles, new business units were on par with last year’s quarter.\n\nConsequently, the penetration rate for lease and loan offerings increased by 1.2 percentage points to 43 percent.\n\nFor used vehicles, new business units decreased moderately, due to the lower number of end-of-lease vehicles that were returned compared to the first quarter of 2024.\n\nNew business volume grew by 2.4 percent to 16 billion euros, driven by a higher average financing amount per contract.\n\nSegment earnings for the first quarter amounted to 650 million euros, a year-on-year decrease of 80 million euros.\n\nThis results mainly from two factors:\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained at a low rate of 0.23 percent.\n\nSLIDE 8: Motorcycles Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, first-quarter deliveries decreased slightly by 3.9 percent year-on-year.\n\nEBIT for the first three months totalled 76 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 9.4 percent.\n\nSLIDE 9: Outlook 2025\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nLet’s move to our outlook for 2025.\n\nOur guidance given at the Annual Conference on March 14th included all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th.\n\nSince then, political and macroeconomic volatility has increased even further.\n\nDue to ongoing developments and negotiations, the expected effects from tariffs on 2025 results can only be estimated based on certain assumptions.\n\nSo, we have taken the latest impact as of May 5th, meaning tariffs on US imports of CBU (= completely built up) and non-USMCA components at an additional 25%. But on the other hand, the executive order from last week regarding non-stacking and the eligibility of 3.75% of MSRP for the Spartanburg production volume has some positive impact, given our strong local footprint in the US.\n\nAnd the extremely high tariffs for imports from the US to China are neglectable, given we also have a strong local footprint in China.\n\nIn particular, the localization of the X5 in 2022 helps mitigating.\n\nAnd still, the tariff increases that started to come into effect from early March will have a notable impact on the Q2 results.\n\nWe assume that some of the tariff increases as of May 5th or up to May 5th will be temporary and that there will be reductions from July 2025.\n\nOur guidance also includes measures to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs.\n\nBased on these assumptions, our guidance parameters for the full year remain unchanged.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are expected to be at previous year’s level.\n\nIn the Automotive segment, we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries.\n\nThe EBIT margin is expected in a corridor between 5 and 7 percent.\n\nThe EBIT margin in the Motorcycles Segment should come in at between 5.5 and 7.5 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment we are targeting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 13 to 16 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 10: Q1 Performance in Line with Expectations\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group delivered as expected in the first quarter with an EBIT margin at the upper end of our full-year target corridor.\n\nThe geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty has reached a level we have rarely seen before.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the current macroeconomic conditions on consumer sentiment.\n\nIt is therefore all the more important that we continue to follow our long-term strategic plan.\n\nThis includes using the flexibility of our global network to mitigate the impact of the current developments.\n\nAnd it includes disciplined spending – be it R&D, capex or operating costs.\n\nAs we walk the talk, nominal cost reductions are already visible in our Q1 figures.\n\nOur clear long-term strategy, our strong brands and products and the high level of cost discipline throughout our entire organisation remain the basis for our long-term financial success."}

Attractive products, strong order volumes and strict cost discipline have ensured for the BMW Group a start to the year according to plan. The premium manufacturer from Munich continued its dynamic BEV ramp-up in a volatile and competitive environment, while delivering profitability at the upper end of its 2025 target range in the Automotive Segment. The BMW Group has thus once again confirmed the long-term viability of its strategy of technology openness.\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, the BMW Group delivered 586,117 premium vehicles to customers (-1.4%). More than a quarter of these were electrified (26.9%), with fully-electric vehicles once again showing significant sales growth of +32.4%. The EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment – one of the company’s key profit indicators – stood at 6.9%, placing it at the upper end of the targeted range of 5-7% for the year.\n\n“The more challenging the environment, the more crucial it is to have compelling products, a consistent strategy and a high degree of flexibility. Our technology-open approach remains a key success factor: with our young, highly attractive models and our broad range of drives, we are able to meet the various needs of customers worldwide. This enables us to achieve robust results and stay on course to meet our ambitious full-year targets,” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we are putting our biggest future project on the road: we are expanding our fully-electric offering, and rolling out future technology clusters and the new design language across our entire model portfolio. This will raise the level of innovation in our vehicles across all drive types to a whole new level – while also setting the course for profitable growth and sustainable success.”\n\nSignificant increase in fully-electric vehicle deliveries\n\nDespite persistently strong competition in China, the company's global deliveries remained largely in line with the previous year (-1.4%). In the first three months, the BMW Group achieved growth in key markets Europe (+6.2%) and the US (+4.0%).\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, the BMW brand delivered a total of 520,121 vehicles to customers worldwide, surpassing the previous year’s volume in all regions except China. The strongest growth was recorded by the new BMW 5 Series models (+35.8%), as well as the BMW X1 and X2 variants (+31.8%).\n\nThe BMW M brand achieved solid sales growth of +5.0% in the first quarter, delivering a total of 50,500 vehicles to customers. The main growth drivers were the high-performance models BMW M3* and M3 Touring* as well as BMW M5* and BMW M5 touring*, which were in high demand across all regions.\n\nThe MINI brand, which updated its entire product range over the course of last year, sold 64,615 units worldwide – an increase of 4.1%. The Rolls-Royce brand delivered 1,381 units to customers between January and March (-9.4%).\n\nFully-electric vehicles from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands reported significant growth, with 109,513 deliveries worldwide (+32.4%). The BMW iX1* was the brand’s most successful BEV model, while the BMW i4* accounted for half of all BMW 4 Series delivered.\n\nSales of fully-electric vehicles saw the strongest growth in Europe (+64.2%). New models from the MINI brand were major contributors to this: The urban premium brand delivered a total of 22,794 fully-electric vehicles, achieving a BEV share of 35.3%.\n\nThe BMW Group currently offers at least one model with an electrified drive train in every vehicle class. Total deliveries of electrified vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) also rose significantly in the first three months of the year, reaching 157,487 vehicles (2024: 122,582 vehicles/+28.5%).\n\nThe BMW Group is successfully implementing its strategic plan to further expand e-mobility. Additionally, it will reach two significant sales milestones: first, the delivery of 1.5 million fully-electric premium vehicles since the market launch of the BMW i3 in 2013; and second, a total of three million electrified cars since then.\n\nGroup EBT margin at 9.2%\n\nFirst-quarter Group revenues totalled € 33,758 million (2024: € 36,614 million/-7.8%; currency-adjusted: -8,7%). As previously announced, the BMW Group benefited from a moderate reduction in administrative and sales expenses. Compared with the previous year, sales revenues declined particularly in the highly competitive Chinese market, as expected.\n\nBetween January and March, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 3,113 million (2024: € 4,162 million/-25.2%).\n\nThe EBT margin for this period was 9.2% (2024: 11.4%). Group net profit for the first quarter totalled € 2,173 million (2024: € 2,951 million/-26.4%).\n\nAutomotive EBIT margin at upper end of full-year guidance\n\nThe Automotive Segment earned revenues of € 29,211 million (2024: € 30,939 million/-5.6%%).\n\nThe anti-subsidy tariffs on BEVs produced in China, introduced by the European Commission in October, increased the cost of sales, creating a headwind in the low three-digit million euro range, as forecast.\n\nEarnings before financial result (EBIT) for the first quarter totalled € 2,024 million (2024: € 2,710 million/-25.3%). The EBIT margin came in at 6.9% (2024: 8.8%) and was thus at the high end of the target range of 5-7% for the year. Excluding depreciation and amortisation from the BBA purchase price allocation,the EBIT margin for the first quarter was 8.1%.\n\nThe BMW Group is systematically leveraging innovations, focusing on efficient and low-emission technologies, as well as further electrification and digitalisation of both its product line-up and the company.\n\nBased on the strength of its current operating performance, the BMW Group allocated € 1,984 million (2024: € 1,974 million/+0.5%) to research and development in the first quarter which was concentrated on electrification and digitalisation of the vehicle fleet across all model series.\n\nThe company also incurred R&D expenditure primarily for the future models of the NEUE KLASSE, such as the BMW iX3, and the successor models to the BMW X5 and BMW X7.\n\n“The BMW Group stands for long-term growth, sustainable value creation and continued dependability for its stakeholders. Stable financial performance and effective cost management characterised the first quarter despite the challenging environment. We remain focused on improving our efficiency and optimising our cost structures,” said Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, at the quarterly conference call in Munich.\n\n“Digitalisation and AI are contributing to this. Innovation and business benefits go hand in hand for us. We are also leveraging the proven flexibility of our network to address the current geopolitical challenges.”\n\nAutomotive Segment free cash flow at € 413 million\n\nThe free cash flow of the Automotive segment amounted to €413 million in the first quarter of 2025 (2024: €1,283 million). The decline compared to the previous year is primarily due to lower earnings before taxes, an expected higher consumption of provisions, and increased cash outflows from capital expenditures related to 31 December 2024 in the amount of €964 million.\n\nConversely, the seasonally typical but significantly lower increase in stock compared to the previous year led to the change in working capital of €65 million (2024: -€1,189 million).\n\nFrom January to March, capital expenditure totaled €1,202 million (2024: €1,323 million/-9.1%). The capex ratio came in at 3.6% (2024: 3.6%).\n\nThe BMW Group is still targeting a free cash flow of > € 5 billion in the Automotive Segment for the full year.\n\nRobust performance in Financial Services Segment\n\nBMW Group Financial Services benefited from dynamic new leasing business in the first quarter of the year, with new leasing contracts up 12.7%. Overall, total new retail business was down slightly, compared to the previous year, with 402,811 new contracts concluded (-4.6%). The financing and leasing business for new vehicles remained at the previous year's level. Outside of China, new business was stable at a high level.\n\nThe volume of new business increased slightly, driven by higher financing volumes per vehicle across all financing and leasing contracts with retail customers, reaching € 15,988 million (2024: € 15,620 million/+2.4%).\n\nThe percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 43.0% at the end of the first quarter (2024: 41.8%/+1.2 percentage points). In the three-month period, the segment reported pre-tax earnings of € 650 million (2024: € 730 million/-11.0%). Most notably, lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles led to a year-on-year decrease in earnings, as the number of end-of-lease vehicles was lower than in the previous year. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio remained at the low rate of 0.23% across the entire loan portfolio (2024: 0.21%).\n\nBMW Motorrad with EBT margin of 9.4%\n\nIn the year to the end of March, BMW Motorrad delivered 44,609 motorcycles and scooters to customers (2024: 46,434 units; -3.9%). The segment EBIT margin of 9.4% (2024: 12.2%) was above the targeted range of 5.5-7.5% for the year.\n\nBMW AG continues share repurchase programme\n\nFollowing the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 11 May 2022, the company has acquired treasury shares. The shares from the initial repurchase programme have already been retired.\n\nAs of 31 March 2025, BMW AG holds 22,317,345 own shares from the second buy-back programme, corresponding to a nominal amount of €22,317,345.\n\nBased on the authorisation granted at the Annual General Meeting of 11 May 2022, as of 31 March 2025, BMW AG had purchased shares equivalent to 7.27% of the share capital.\n\nBMW Group confirms full-year guidanceThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecasts for global economic growth downwards to 2.8% in April 2025: Current trade conflicts and the associated potential rise in inflation, as well as uncertainty among businesses and consumers, could weigh on global growth.\n\nAccording to sector forecasts, the global automotive markets are likely to see slight growth.\n\nThe BMW Group expects demand to rise in many markets in 2025, driven by a stabilizing inflation and further moderate interest rate cuts. In the USA, permanent tariffs could be reflected in rising inflation.\n\nThe guidance* published in the BMW Group Report 2024 in March 2025 includes all tariff increases that had taken effect by 12 March 2025. Due to the volatile developments and ongoing negotiations, the potential impact of tariffs in the current financial year can only be estimated, based on assumptions. The BMW Group expects some of the tariff increases to be temporary, with reductions from July 2025. The forecast also includes mitigating measures to offset the impact of higher tariffs.\n\nGiven the sustained demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group is able to confirm its guidance for the year. The company anticipates slight sales growth, with fully-electric vehicles contributing to a slightly higher share of deliveries. Due to the factors mentioned above, Group earnings before tax are expected to be on a par with the previous year.**The EBIT margin for the Automotive Segment is forecast to be within the range of 5.0-7.0%, with an RoCE of between 9-13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, RoE is projected to be between 13-16%.\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, a slight increase in sales and an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%are forecast, with an RoCE of 13-17%.\n\nThe above targets will be achieved with the current number of employees.\n\nThe BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from these projections – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Risks to earnings could arise, for instance, from further tariff increases or tariffs remaining in place for longer than planned, potentially extending well into the second half of the year. The company continues to closely monitor macroeconomic developments.\n\nEscalation of trade disputes could also lead to supply bottlenecks – for example, from import or export restrictions on specific parts or raw materials.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: In Q1 2025\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1 Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang.\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues\n\n3 Common/preferred shares.

For details, please refer to the glossary in the BMW Group Report 2024.\n\nGLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle.\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nA new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.\n\nProfit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\nProfit/loss as a percentage of revenues.\n\nPlug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.\n\nReturn on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Finance Communications\n\nSebastian Keßler, Communications BMW Group, Strategy\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann, head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nWith its four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services. The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide; the company has a global sales network in more than 140 countries.\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. Sustainability is a key component of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy – from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i4 eDrive35: Energieverbrauch kombiniert: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2-Emissionen kombiniert: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2-Klasse: A BMW iX1 eDrive20: Energieverbrauch kombiniert: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen kombiniert: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klasse: A BMW M5 Limousine: Energieverbrauch gewichtet kombiniert: 26,8 kWh/100 km und 1,9 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen gewichtet kombiniert: 43 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klassen: Bei entladener Batterie G; gewichtet kombiniert B BMW M5 Touring: Energieverbrauch gewichtet kombiniert: 27,6 kWh/100 km und 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen gewichtet kombiniert: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klassen: Bei entladener Batterie G; gewichtet kombiniert B; Kraftstoffverbrauch bei entladener Batterie: 10,9 l/100 km (WLTP) BMW M3 Competition Limousine mit M xDrive: Energieverbrauch kombiniert: 10,2–10,1 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen kombiniert: 230–228 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klasse(n): G BMW M3 CS Touring: Energieverbrauch kombiniert: 10,5 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-Emissionen kombiniert: 238 g/km (WLTP); CO₂-Klasse(n): G"}

BMW M Motorsport will compete with a star-studded line-up at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) on the last weekend of June. A total of eleven BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will be on the starting grid at the world's largest GT3 race. In addition to the two Pro Cup cars that compete throughout the entire Endurance Cup season of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, three more BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars with nine BMW M works drivers in the cockpits will compete in the highest category for BMW's 26th overall victory. A particularly notable trio will be in car #46: Valentino Rossi (ITA), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), and René Rast (GER).\n\nIn the Pro Cup at Spa-Francorchamps, a total of five BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will compete, with three fielded by Team WRT and two by the ROWE Racing Team. The Belgian WRT team will have its home race with the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, which is shared throughout the season of the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup by Ugo de Wilde, Charles Weerts (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). This trio won the season opener at Le Castellet (FRA). Additionally, the star-studded car #46 will see Magnussen compete in his first GT3 race for BMW M Motorsport, and car #31 will feature the three BMW M works drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER). All three drivers, like Magnussen, are part of BMW M Motorsport's LMDh programme.\n\nROWE Racing is expanding its line-up from one to two cars. In the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, GT World Challenge Europe regulars Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) will compete. Additionally, car #998 will include BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Dan Harper (GBR), and Max Hesse (GER). All three competed in the entire Endurance Cup season for ROWE Racing in 2024, but this season their main programmes are in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Eng, a three-time Spa winner (2016, 2018, 2023), is aiming for his fourth triumph in the Ardennes.\n\nBesides the five Pro Cup cars, six additional BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars compete in the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe and thus also at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Only once before has BMW M Motorsport been represented with so many cars since the beginning of the GT3 era, in 2015 with the BMW Z4 GT3. In the Gold Cup, AlManar Racing by Team WRT will field one car, and in the Silver Cup, Team WRT, Paradine Competition, and Century Motorsport will each enter one BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Additionally, one car each from Paradine Competition and BMW Italia Ceccato Racing will compete in the Bronze Cup.\n\nThe Prologue next week offers teams and drivers the opportunity to work on the set-up of the cars and to get accustomed to the challenging circuit.\n\nComments on the line-up:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are proud to be able to compete this year with such an impressive line-up at the world's largest GT3 race. Eleven BMW M4 GT3 EVOs, five of which are competing in the Pro Cup for the overall victory – that's simply fantastic! Never before have we had more GT3 cars at the 24h Spa-Francorchamps. Many thanks to everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport, the teams, and the drivers, without whom such a massive race effort would be unthinkable. The fact that we could get Valentino Rossi, Kevin Magnussen, and René Rast to share a car is a real highlight for the fans at the track and in front of the screens. From the perspective of BMW M Motorsport, I am looking forward to the performances of all BMW M4 GT3 EVO crews: the quintet in the Pro Cup competing for the overall victory, as well as the sextet fighting for wins in the other classes. Particularly, they are proof of how attractive our BMW M4 GT3 EVO is for customer teams. This trust in our product honours us.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “I am very happy to be back at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. It is a great race – very demanding and difficult – on a fantastic and challenging track. The level of competition between the best GT cars, teams and drivers in the world is extremely high. I can’t wait to race there together with my great teammates Kevin Magnussen and René Rast.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “I am really looking forward to competing with BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and getting to know the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. I have some GT experience from a joint start with my father at the Gulf 12 Hours a few years ago. René and Valentino will surely help me a lot in getting accustomed to the car quickly. It's exciting to share a car with both of them. Valentino is a legend, and René, whom I know well from the FIA WEC, is a true champion. It will be a pleasure to compete together at the 24h Spa-Francorchamps.”\n\nRené Rast (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “It is also a very special experience for me to compete at Spa-Francorchamps with two high-calibre drivers like Kevin and Valentino. I have won the 24-hour race twice – once with WRT – but I haven't been there for a few years. This time I'm back because I find the project very exciting and I'm sure I'll have a great time with Kevin and Valentino. Kevin obviously still lacks experience in the GT3 car, but I can certainly help him with that. He is a great racer and will quickly find his way.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “First of all, I am very happy to be back in the GT3 car. Due to my main programmes in the Hypercar, I have few opportunities to compete in GT3 races this season. The 24h Spa-Francorchamps is an absolute highlight for me. I have been on the podium there twice but have never won. I would like to achieve this milestone this time. I think with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and my two driver colleagues, we have all the possibilities to do so. I know Dries and Marco very well, which will surely help us quickly get up to speed. Our very good mutual understanding is an important factor for our line-up.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#998 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing): “I am very excited to compete once more at Spa-Francorchamps with ROWE Racing and hopefully achieve my fourth victory at the 24-hour race. For me, the Prologue will first be about getting used to the GT3 car again. But I don't expect any difficulties, as after so many years the feeling is ingrained. It's a great story that I'm sharing the car with Dan and Max. I've known them since hour zero, as I was one of the mentors of the BMW Junior Team back then. Seeing them now as established works drivers and witnessing how they deliver absolute top performances every race weekend is fantastic.”\n\nOverview of the driver line-ups in the Pro Cup:\n\n#31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nSheldon van der Linde (RSA)\n\n#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nKelvin van der Linde (RSA)\n\n#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nKevin Magnussen (DEN)\n\nValentino Rossi (ITA)\n\n#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing:\n\nRaffaele Marciello (SUI)\n\n#998 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing:"}

For the first time, this joy can now also be experienced through the sense of smell, with the two new BMW fragrances AMBERNESS and BERGAMOOD.\n\nStefan Karch, Head of BMW Lifestyle & Licensing, explains: “The new BMW fragrances AMBERNESS and BERGAMOOD convey the hallmark BMW joy in a new way. Like the BMW brand, they are immersive, inviting and expressive. As daily companions, they make a special statement that customers can identify with, and that emphasises the emotional aspect of the BMW brand.”\n\nMarco Vidal, CEO of Mavive S.p.A., adds: “Developing AMBERNESS and BERGAMOOD was an exciting challenge. BMW has shaped the automotive world and Mavive stands for pushing boundaries within the fragrance industry. The synergy arising from this collaboration resulted in two new fragrances and a unique sensory experience.”\n\nFresh and invigorating, sensual and calm, or a combination of both.\n\nThe new BMW fragrances deliberately transcend gender boundaries and will smell equally gorgeous on everyone. Both eaux de parfum work as standalone scents or develop very special and highly individual fragrance experiences when combined and/or applied in different concentrations. Mavive goes beyond using the highest-quality ingredients to create an experience of joy and turn it into an everyday companion. It uses EmotiWaves™, developed by dsm-firmenich, a company specialising in fragrances and flavours. This technology is grounded in leading-edge, patented and certified neuroscientific findings. It uses natural ingredients to influence and amplify emotions.\n\nAMBERNESS offers a sensual experience that conveys tranquillity and a feeling of beauty. French clary sage and Guatemalan cardamom provide an earthy accord that is followed by Italian bergamot and Egyptian geranium. Madagascar vanilla, Indonesian patchouli and Haitian vetiver create an enchanting allure.\n\nBERGAMOOD has a fresh and invigorating effect. The top note rings with the scents of Italian bergamot and mandarin, enriched with pink pepper. Lavender and petitgrain leave a lasting impression. Liquidambar and musk round off the fragrance, for a lively and stimulating effect.\n\nThe bottle shape evokes the iconic BMW Headquarters building in Munich.The bottles for BERGAMOOD and AMBERNESS have a minimalist design. They are made of transparent glass, and their cylindrical shape evokes the iconic BMW Headquarters building in Munich. The black cap of each bottle is embossed with the BMW logo. The round rim and the metal finish of the cap make the bottle look particularly sophisticated. The label with its white background uses a similarly bold design.\n\nBMW is committed to the climate goals of the Paris Agreement and implements strict requirements down to the last detail. The new fragrances are no exception. They meet the highest quality and sustainability standards and contain only natural and sustainable ingredients. Even the high-quality box is made from FSC‑certified paper.\n\nMavive has been creating fragrances for 120 years. The new scents were created in close collaboration with Mavive, a company owned by the Vidal family, which has been developing fragrances for over 120 years. Today, Mavive has a presence in more than 90 countries. The two BMW scents were created by world-renowned perfumers Frank Voelkl and Alexandra Monet.\n\nThe new BMW fragrances AMBERNESS and BERGAMOOD will be available in selected perfumeries as well as in the BMW Lifestyle Online Shop ( and at selected BMW dealerships from May.\n\nThe eaux de parfum are priced at 62.00 euros for 50 ml and 85.00 euros for 100 ml.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nCypselus von Frankenberg, Product Communication BMW Automobiles\n\nAlexandra Landers, Head of Product and Brand Communication BMW\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe economic success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had a solid weekend with strong results for Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) during the fourth round of the FIM Superbike World Championship at Cremona (ITA). Razgatlioglu rode his BMW M 1000 RR to second place in both the Superpole Race and the two main races, collecting important points for both World Championship standings. Teammate van der Mark impressed in Lombardy with great battles and celebrated three top-ten placements. In the riders' standings, Razgatlioglu confidently defended his second overall position, keeping the gap to the leader Nicolò Bulega (ITA), who won all three races, within limits. The fifth event of the WorldSBK 2025 will be held in two weeks (May 16-18) at Most, Czech Republic.\n\nReactions after the Cremona round:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “We can be very proud of the team's performance over the past weeks. You can see how hard we are fighting to get back to the top. After Assen, we have made a significant step forward and are more consistent. Toprak is right behind Bulega - we have already left the rest of the field behind us, which is crucial for us. We have closed the gap and can continue to work in the same way. Positive signs are also visible with Mikey. On the short track, everything was incredibly tight, a tenth faster in qualifying and the whole weekend would have looked different. He continues to work on his riding style to be fast as well. Overall, we definitely had a positive weekend. We look forward with confidence and will continue to give everything so that we will soon be back at the top again.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: \"It was literally a hot race. Even though the results might not fully reflect it, Mickey's performance was very strong. In qualifying, he was less than a tenth away from fifth place, so a P5 pace was evident both in qualifying and in the races. However, the track is very peculiar and offers very few overtaking opportunities, which made it difficult for him to move forward. Generally, the pace was higher than the race result indicates. Consequently, the weekend was very satisfying. Toprak maximised the high track temperatures and proved with his three second-places that we continue to be competitive and that our package is podium-capable this year as well. To become victory-capable, we still need to find a bit more. We continue to work intensively on this. But Toprak is giving his all, the BMW is giving its all, the team has continued to work hard and made no mistakes. We have improved from session to session in lap times and performance, the gaps have been getting smaller. Overall, it was a very successful race weekend.\"\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This weekend was a hard weekend, we’ve tried to improve the bike, from session to session, especially because I couldn’t race here last year. We did a very good job, because everbody was working so hard and every session we were able to improve the bike. Unfortunately not enough to win a race but P2 is better than nothing, especially after Assen. We also took very good points for the championship, so we are all in all happy. And we for sure will never give up. I like the race at Most and I’m usually very good there, so I will try to do my best again and will try to fight for the wins.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had a consistent weekend. We improved quite a lot but on this track it is so hard to overtake as everyone is doing the same pace. Our pace in every race has been good but track position is very important – and we were a bit unlucky in terms of position in every race actually. We scored some good points but for sure we want to fight for at least top-five. So we have to improve the package. But Most is a different track and i am sure we will do better there.”\n\nAir temperature: 25°, track temperature: 35°, humidity: 54%, conditions: dry.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAir temperature: 28°, track temperature: 45°, humidity: 33%, conditions: dry, laps: 23.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 9, 1:29.024\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 35°, humidity: 50%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 4, 1:27,980 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 25°, track temperature: 43°, humidity:46%, conditions: dry, laps: 23.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 10 1:28,576\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R04/12, after 12 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R04/12, after 12 of 36 races)."}

It is lighter in design, more accessible and more dynamic than ever before. In addition, with a completely new engine, chassis and aerodynamics, it offers a riding experience that meets the highest demands in this segment in terms of dynamics, comfort and travel capability\". Harald Spagl, Project Manager BMW R 1300 RT\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT: Wider range from comfortable tourer to dynamic country road motorcycle. Dynamic design language with optimised wind and weather protection.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT follows in the footsteps of its highly successful predecessor. It continues to build on the proven qualities of the BMW RT, such as touring capability and riding comfort - alone, as a pair or with plenty of luggage.\n\nAt the same time, the new R 1300 RT has broadened its usage profile by making its dynamic systems even more prominent. Sporty optional equipment such as the sport brake, the enhanced Shift Assistant Pro and the newly developed DCA electronic suspension allow an even more active and dynamic riding style. The range of optional extras is complemented by the Automated Shift Assistant ASA, which can be ridden in a sporty and dynamic manual mode, but also allows comfortable riding in automatic mode. All this, combined with a more dynamic and visually lighter design, promises to continue the success story of the BMW RT.\n\nThe wind and weather protection concept of the new R 1300 RT includes adjustable side trim that is homogeneously integrated into the design. This makes it possible to provide the rider with an adequate supply of fresh air at all times, even in challenging conditions such as city traffic or high outside temperatures on country roads, and to offer highly effective protection from the wind and weather at low temperatures when riding on the highway or motorway.\n\nIn addition to the basic version in Alpine White 3 uni colour, the new BMW R 1300 RT is available in the Triple Black model variant in Blackstorm metallic, the emphatically dynamic Impulse model variant in Racing Blue metallic and the particularly elegant model variant Option 719 Camargue in Blue Ridge Mountain metallic.\n\nPerfect ergonomics and equipment for comfortable and dynamic travelling and touring.\n\nThe BMW R 1300 RT's design, engine and chassis are not the only aspects of the BMW touring icon that reflect the BMW Motorrad development team's ambition to expand the range of possible uses of the new BMW R 1300 RT and make it even more dynamic. Equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new R 1300 RT have been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward. This results in improved feedback from the front section and therefore even greater controllability during dynamic riding. At the same time, the more active seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. The height and angle of the rider's seat can be adjusted to fine-tune the riding position. Passenger comfort has also been significantly improved. The new cases now offer more space for the passenger’s lower legs without compromising the volume of the cases. The passenger seat has also been lengthened. There is now more space to change your seating position from time to time on longer trips.\n\nA choice of different seat heights for optimum riding comfort and a new luggage system with electric cases and topcase. Additional variable-volume case system for optimum customisation.\n\nAs usual, BMW Motorrad's engineers have paid particular attention to easy access and a low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 RT placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of only 780 mm. The inner leg curve is also significantly smaller than on the previous model. In addition to the standard seat, other seats are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT is equipped as standard with cases (27 litres each) for touring and holiday trips. Further highlights of the new R 1300 RT are the Vario cases, available ex works for the first time as an optional equipment for a BMW RT. The variable luggage system allows the volume to be adjusted from 27 to 33 litres to suit the width of the motorcycle. Both cases are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The two topcases with a capacity of 39 and 54 litres respectively offer additional storage space. The large 54-litre luggage compartment is also electric. A special feature is the heated backrest for the passenger.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power output and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 RT has a capacity of exactly 1,300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7,750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 ,00 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6,250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9,000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 RT has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 RT can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, the engine drag control instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated Shift Assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the Automated Shift Assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre - without sacrificing the dynamics of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 RT has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 RT now has an aluminium lattice tube rear frame.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 RT is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nThe best of both worlds: EVO Telelever front wheel guide with flex element and new EVO Paralever rear wheel guide for even greater steering precision and ride stability. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nThe front wheel guide in the new R 1300 RT follows the Telelever principle introduced by BMW Motorrad 30 years ago - but in an innovative, newly designed form that combines the best of both worlds.\n\nWith the Evo Telelever, BMW Motorrad now combines the strengths of the two previously used Telelever variants in the new BMW R 1300 RT. Clamped tightly to the fork tubes - as previously in the sporty design - the upper fork construction (as in the GS) incorporates a handlebar decoupling system that prevents any detrimental tilting movement and only transmits steering forces.\n\nThe rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 RT has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels.\n\nNew electronic suspension Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) for two rider-selectable riding positions for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling as well as with dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation as optional equipment ex works.\n\nEven the standard Dynamic ESA electronic chassis offers a high level of riding safety and riding enjoyment on a wide variety of road surfaces thanks to dynamic adjustment of the damping and load-dependent adjustment of the rear spring preload.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) now goes one step further and, in addition to the familiar Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) options - such as dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation - offers two rider-selectable riding positions via the riding modes for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling. This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience in all conditions.\n\nDCA has been developed with equal emphasis on dynamic performance and comfort. The new semi-active chassis offers two different riding positions. One riding position has a flat steering head angle and therefore a chassis geometry designed to maximise riding stability and smoothness. The second riding position features firmer damping tuning, a higher spring rate and a higher ride height. Raising the rear end more than the front results in a steeper steering head angle and reduced castor, making the motorcycle easier to steer and handle. DCA makes these two different chassis geometries possible and combines them with the riding modes.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 RT comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 RT can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nNew full LED headlights and state-of-the-art LED light units feature all round. Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight and pitch compensation as well as adaptive light modes with intelligent adjustment of the alignment and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations are available as optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor decades now, BMW Motorrad has been regarded as a frontrunner when it comes to safety in connection with motorcycling. Accordingly, the new R 1300 RT comes with state-of-the-art LED light units all around as standard. The new full LED headlamp which illuminates the road with unrivalled brightness and clarity, underlines the prestige of the new R 1300 RT. The light unit consists of an LED module with multiple LEDs for low beam and high beam. The daytime running light or position light icon (depending on the market), which is positioned to the left and right of the headlamp, provides a distinctive look.\n\nHeadlight Pro goes one step further available as optional equipment ex works. In addition to the adaptive headlight, the headlamp of the new R 1300 RT also features pitch compensation - for example when accelerating and decelerating as well as for levelling the riding position in DCA. Headlight Pro features a servomotor that automatically and actively adjusts the position of the cut-off line to keep the vertical inclination within the optimum range when the load or load status changes.\n\nHeadlight Pro can be further enhanced with the optional “Adaptive Light Modes” (depending on market), which offer lighting technology that intelligently adapts the direction and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations. The Adaptive Lighting Modes provide optimum lighting conditions for night-time riding with speed-dependent road illumination. Lighting is provided in several stages: for low, medium and high speeds.

The motorcycle has been consistently designed with dynamic riding in mind. Thanks to an all-new engine, chassis and aerodynamic concept, it offers an even sportier riding experience than its predecessor. At the same time, it remains the perfect companion for comfortable touring and long-distance travel.” Hauke Glässing, Project Manager BMW R 1300 RS\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RS: The new sports tourer with boxer engine, featuring refined technology and styling, along with a dynamic design that signals sporty flair. Four attractive model variants.\n\nThe goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 RS was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the sports touring bike with boxer engine. Alongside its much sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 RS remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a higher windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.\n\nIn addition to the basic version in Racing Blue metallic, the BMW R 1300 RS is also available as the Triple Black model variant in Blackstorm metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium Option 719 Cuyamaca variant in Brooklyn Grey metallic.\n\nSporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun on country roads as well as comfortable touring and travel.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 RS significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new sports touring bike with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new R 1300 RS has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and travel, even with a passenger. For a more touring-oriented riding position, the optional comfort handlebars are also available.\n\nVarious seat options and comfort handlebars allow for an optimised seating position. Featuring electrified cases and topcase, along with a clever tank bag, a new luggage system ensures a comfortable experience on extended tours and holiday trips.\n\nSince the launch of the BMW R 100 RS in 1976, BMW RS models with boxer engines have earned a legendary reputation for perfectly combining sporty motorcycling, the thrill of cornering and comfortable touring. For this reason, the new BMW R 1300 RS not only features a new luggage system, but also offers a wide range of seat variants and optional comfort handlebars to meet the individual ergonomic needs of all riders. In addition to the standard rider’s seat, five others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor touring and holiday trips, the new BMW R 1300 RS can be equipped ex works with case holders and a topcase carrier, while a newly developed case system and topcase are available as part of the Original BMW Motorrad Accessories range. The cases offer a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively, while the topcase holds 39 litres. The two cases and the topcase are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. Both the cases and the topcase also feature interior lighting, while the left-hand case and the topcase additionally include a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 RS has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 RS has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 RS can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works. Among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 RS has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 RS now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 RS is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and new EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 RS, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 RS has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 RS also features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels. The reduced rotational masses result in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimised handling qualities.\n\nNew electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA), with dynamic adjustment of the damping, spring rate and load compensation as optional equipment. The world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.\n\nWith its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear, the standard electronic Dynamic ESA itself offers a high level of ride safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. After the new R 1300 R presented a few weeks ago, this makes the new BMW R 1300 RS the second series production motorcycle with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring rest. With DSA, the rider benefits from even more refined handling and increased banking freedom in “Dynamic” mode.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new R 1300 RS comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 RS can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nStandard full LED headlight with separate high beam and state-of-the-art LED light units all round. For the first time on a BMW RS, Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light is available as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 RS comes as standard with a newly designed twin-chamber LED headlight in a very slim, sporty design featuring a distinctive light icon. The lighting unit comprises two LED elements for the low beam and two additional, separately positioned LED elements for the high beam. Two more LED units are provided for the daytime running light and side light. State-of-the-art LED light units with newly designed LED rear light round off the lighting concept of the new R 1300 RS.\n\nWith the optional Adaptive Turning Light, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimised for cornering, depending on the banking position, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimising the light pattern, the dipped beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW) for more convenient and safer motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new R 1300 RS comes as standard with Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) with braking function, while the Riding Assistant as optional equipment ex works offers a significantly wider range of functions, including Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW), and the new Rear End Collision Warning (RECW).\n\nFor the first time, navigation preparation now features electric locking for maximum operating comfort as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThis item of ex works optional equipment allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a mount cradle. For the first time, this mount no longer requires a key – it unlocks electrically for maximum convenience.\n\nOptional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 RS.\n\nAn extensive program of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 RS.\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW R 1300 RS:"}

Right in the middle of it all is BMW M Motorsport and two pairs of racing brothers navigating the tension between family and competition on the track. This one-hour documentary vividly and emotionally captures June 2024 and its legendary endurance events at the Nürburgring (GER), Le Mans (FRA), and Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). Central to the story are Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde (both RSA), as well as Dries and Laurens Vanthoor (both BEL). The film has been available since 14th April 2025 on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, YouTube Movies, and Apple TV.\n\nThe tight scheduling of the world’s three biggest 24-hour races within a single month in June 2024 pushed manufacturers, teams, cars, and drivers to their absolute limits. Produced by ffilmworx on behalf of BMW M Motorsport, the documentary focuses on two main storylines: the behind-the-scenes perspective of BMW M Motorsport and its staff, who rode a wave of highs and lows on the path to podium finishes at all three races, and the dynamic between BMW M works drivers Sheldon van der Linde and Dries Vanthoor and their brothers – Kelvin van der Linde (then racing for Lamborghini and Lexus) and Laurens Vanthoor (Porsche) – both on and off the racetrack.\n\nThe film is being released just in time for June 2025, when all participants will face the same challenges once again – only this time, even more intense. The three 24-hour races are scheduled even closer together, and now, with both Kelvin and Sheldon van der Linde competing as teammates for BMW M Motorsport, “72hellride” gains even more topical relevance.\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The documentary offers a fantastic insight into the emotional rollercoaster that these three major 24-hour races take everyone on. I remember that month very clearly – it was mentally and emotionally demanding for me and for everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport. Seeing podium finishes in all three races on paper looks great, but we all felt there was even more potential. I think the documentary does a brilliant job of capturing this emotional ride. It also gives a beautiful look into the relationships between the van der Linde and Vanthoor brothers. Now, June 2025 is just around the corner, and with its even tighter schedule, it's sure to deliver more unforgettable stories. As stressful as it’s going to be – I’m truly looking forward to it.”"}

Can artificial intelligence (AI) make quality control in vehicle production more efficient, faster and more reliable? A software solution developed at BMW Group Plant Regensburg as part of the “GenAI4Q” pilot project is making this a reality. At its core is an AI that delivers tailored inspection recommendations for the approximately 1,400 vehicles manufactured each day.\n\n“The use of artificial intelligence supports the digital transformation of BMW Group production towards an intelligently connected factory – for example, we are using AI for quality control in vehicle assembly. In this way, we are optimizing our production processes and creating added value for our products and, ultimately, for our customers” says Armin Ebner, head of BMW Group Plant Regensburg.\n\nBMW vehicles meet the highest standards of product quality. To ensure this, Plant Regensburg conducts numerous quality tests throughout the production process. Shortly before leaving the plant, vehicles undergo a final inspection: Trained specialists examine each finished vehicle once more to ensure it meets premium quality standards.\n\nA new vehicle rolls off the Regensburg assembly line every 57 seconds. Each vehicle is built to individual customer specifications for the global market. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on one production line – ranging from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models, as well as countless model and equipment variants. Virtually no two vehicles are alike. “Our AI tool generates an individual inspection catalogue for each specific customer vehicle,” explains Rüdiger Römich, responsible for Test Floor and Finish in Regensburg’s vehicle assembly.\n\nThe AI analyses vast amounts of data to create these custom specifications. This includes not only vehicle data, such as model and equipment variant, but also real-time production data for each specific vehicle. By recognising patterns and correlations, the AI system quickly and automatically determines the scope of the inspection and organises it intelligently, in the right order, within a smartphone app. Römich: “Intuitive usability makes it easy to record findings. Employees can also access additional functions when needed – for example, a microphone icon in the app activates voice recording.” The AI also manages speech recognition and transcription using standardised coding.\n\nAI-based quality inspection was developed at BMW Group Plant Regensburg in collaboration with Munich startup Datagon AI.\n\nSaskia Graser, head of Communications Regensburg and Wackersdorf\n\nMedia website: \n\nBMW Group Plants Regensburg and WackersdorfThe BMW Group vehicle plant in Regensburg has been in operation since 1986 and is one of more than 30 BMW Group production locations worldwide. Every workday, around 1,400 vehicles of the BMW X1 and BMW X2 models roll off the production line at Plant Regensburg, destined for customers around the globe. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on a single production line – ranging from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models.\n\nBMW Group Plant Regensburg was recognised as “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 in the category “excellent large-series assembly” of the prestigious industrial competition. As it implements the so-called BMW iFACTORY, the BMW Group is focused on digitalisation of the Regensburg plant site to create a digital and intelligently connected factory. It is already possible to experience in virtual form what the factory will look like a few years from now. Production of models for the NEUE KLASSE, BMW’s next generation of vehicles, will ramp up in Regensburg in the second half of the decade.The BMW Group plant in Wackersdorf is home to cockpit production and parts supply for overseas plants. With the opening of a new battery testing centre and commissioning of the first phase in autumn 2024, the location is also a key facilitator for electromobility. An entirely new area of expertise is the door and flap centre for Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe BMW Group core staff at the Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations in eastern Bavaria consists of around 9,250 employees, including about 350 apprentices."}

Solid start for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and Schubert Motorsport in the 2025 DTM season. At the team's home event at Oschersleben (GER), René Rast (GER) drove the #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO to the best result of the weekend, finishing fifth in Sunday's race. Marco Wittmann (GER) displayed consistently strong performances in the #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, collecting many valuable points with eighth place on Saturday and sixth on Sunday.\n\nAt the tight Motorsport Arena in Oschersleben, Rast and Wittmann impressed, especially on Sunday with strong comebacks. The track layout does not play to the strengths of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, and both drivers struggled in qualifying. Rast started the second race from P15 and, thanks to a very strong first pit stop, was even on course for a podium at one point. However, during the newly introduced second mandatory stop, he fell back slightly and ultimately finished fifth. On Saturday, Rast had to retire due to a technical issue.\n\nWittmann made a comeback in both races. On Saturday, he started from tenth place and finished eighth, and on Sunday, he did even better, moving up seven places from 13th to sixth thanks to equally strong pit stops by his crew. With 18 points, Wittmann leaves the first DTM venue in seventh place in the drivers' standings, while Rast is twelfth with eleven points. As the defending champions, Schubert Motorsport is in fifth place in the team standings after two of 16 races with 29 points.\n\nThe ADAC GT4 Germany also kicked off its season at Oschersleben. The BMW M Motorsport teams achieved a total of six top-ten finishes with the new BMW M4 GT4 EVO.\n\nReactions after the race weekend:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “A good start to the DTM season with fifth, sixth, and eighth places. Especially on Sunday, both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs were strong in fifth and sixth positions. Compliments to Schubert Motorsport for the strong pit stops. Unfortunately, there was a small issue during René Rast's second stop, otherwise even more could have been possible. Nevertheless, important points at the start, but generally, we of course want to fight for victories and podiums. That is our goal for the upcoming race weekends. I also congratulate ROWE Racing on their third place in the second season race of the Nürburgring Endurance Series on Saturday on the Nordschleife. That was an important and successful test for the 24-hour race in June.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “This weekend, my focus was on both the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. In the DTM, we had a mixed Saturday. More than eighth place for Marco Wittmann was simply not possible under the circumstances. Sunday went much better, and with fifth and sixth places, we collected important points for the championship. In the ADAC GT4 Germany, on Saturday, our BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler, together with Gabriele Piana, was the fastest BMW M Motorsport driver in race one, finishing sixth. Niels Tröger, another Academy participant, was also in action at Oschersleben. In race two, as on Saturday, three BMW M4 GT4 EVOs again made it into the top ten. This is a solid start that we can build on for the rest of the season.”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “I am satisfied that we can take some important points from Oschersleben and thus still have all possibilities in the championship race. On Sunday, René Rast also benefitted from having fresher tyres left after his retirement on Saturday. At times, it even looked like a podium was possible. Unfortunately, the second pit stops didn't go quite as well as the great first stops. But still, fifth and sixth places are a good yield.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: DNF, R2: 5th place): “I am very happy with the comeback to fifth place on Sunday. We had strong pace in the car and made significant progress through a great first pit stop. That there was a small issue during the second stop is not a big deal, as the guys generally always do a fantastic job. I am still very satisfied with the race result. Unfortunately, we had no pace on Saturday and also a small technical problem. That's a shame and means that overall, I look back on a mixed weekend. It would be nice if we could compete on equal terms with the others from the start of the weekend next time, not just on Sunday.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 8th place, R2: 6th place): “We can be very satisfied with the results this weekend. Considering that Oschersleben is not the ideal track for our car, and seeing where we started from, I am very happy with eighth and sixth places. Unfortunately, I lost some positions in the early stages on Sunday and was quite far back. Thanks to a good strategy and great pit stops by the guys, I was able to fight back very well.”"}

On the road to Neue Klasse, the BMW Group will be showcasing the outstanding innovations of future vehicle generations at Auto Shanghai 2025. \"Innovative strength, a pioneering spirit and sheer driving pleasure - these characteristics are deeply rooted in BMW's DNA,\" says Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. \"In the Neue Klasse, they can be experienced by our customers on a whole new level: the user interface is even more intuitive, the design even more progressive and the driving experience even more precise and dynamic. By the end of this year, we will be putting the mobility of the future on the road\".\n\nThe smart display and operating concept BMW Panoramic iDrive and the lightning-fast Heart of Joy central computer take centre stage at the auto show.\n\nBy the end of the year, the iX3 will be the first Neue Klasse model to roll off the production line at the new plant in Debrecen (Hungary). There will be a separate version for China in 2026, following the \"At Home in China\" strategy: The Shanghai design team is responsible for all China-specific models of the NEUE KLASSE, which will be produced at the Shenyang plant.\n\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience is presented to the public for the first time in Shanghai: It is a high-performance test vehicle with no connection to series production, which BMW has designed as a rolling laboratory for optimising the Heart of Joy drive and driving dynamics control system. \"The BMW Vision Driving Experience is equipped with the “Heart of Joy” – one of four super brains specifically developed for our software-defined Neue Klasse models,\" says Jochen Goller, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Customers, Brands and Sales. \"The Heart of Joy takes every aspect of sheer driving pleasure to the next level. Starting with the launch of the first Neue Klasse model, the “Heart of Joy” will beat in every all-electric BMW model\".\n\nThe four super brains combine the computing power for the most important customer functions: infotainment, automated driving, basic functions and driving dynamics. In this new, zonal electronics architecture, the Heart of Joy is responsible for drive, braking, charging, recuperation and partial steering functions. In conjunction with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the system, which was developed entirely in-house, calculates all driving dynamics functions. It processes information ten times faster than previous systems and achieves latencies in the millisecond range. There will be control units with comparable functions for combustion engines and hybrids.\n\nAs the \"world's fastest test rig\", the BMW Vision Driving Experience takes the Heart of Joy and BMW Dynamic Performance Control to their absolute limits. With a maximum torque of 18,000 Newton metres and active aerodynamics, it generates 1.2 tonnes of downforce and lateral forces of up to 3G - a dimension on par with Formula 1 and far beyond the requirements of conventional vehicles in road traffic. The logic behind this: If the hardware and software can tame the brute forces of this test rig, they can easily cope with the demands of everyday use.\n\nIn Shanghai, the BMW Vision Driving Experience shines in an innovative, fluorescent paint finish. The paint's special light-sensitive pigments recharge in daylight, with even the smallest amount of ambient light sufficient. In the dark, the colour varies from a whitish yellow to an expressive neon yellow, depending on the state of charge. In addition, the rear of the car has been fitted with a \"magic film\" which, when stimulated by UV light, creates an expressive gradient from yellow to orange to pink from the rear to the front of the car. These special looks underline the uniqueness and innovative power of the car. Like the vision vehicle, they are not intended for series production.\n\nThe BMW Panoramic iDrive display and operating concept will revolutionise interaction with the vehicle in all new BMW series models from the launch of the Neue Klasse. In Shanghai, it can be seen in a stand-alone version that will be available in BMW models on the Chinese market from mid-2026. The core elements of the innovative concept are the new BMW Panoramic Vision - a head-up display that projects content across the entire width of the windscreen - and the BMW Operating System X. Around 70% of the software in the Chinese version consists of locally developed and adapted source code.\n\nThe system offers a wide range of exclusive digital functions, including the AI-based BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant for China. For example, the Large Language Model (LLM), which is integrated in the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, is the result of a collaboration with Chinese technology pioneer Alibaba. Over the course of the year, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant* will gradually be enhanced with \"AI Reasoning by Deepseek\" for a seamless connection between the vehicle and the outside world.\n\nChina is of outstanding importance for innovation, including in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This is why the BMW Group is strengthening its partnerships with Chinese technology leaders as part of its 360° AI strategy. For BMW, \"China for China\" also means independent software development in the country where the BMW Group has its largest research and development centre outside Germany.\n\nThe MINI brand is showcasing the new John Cooper Works** model generation at the motor show. At the same time, MINI is paying tribute to the brand's racing history. On display in the highlight area, for example, is a classic Mini that competed in the legendary Monte Carlo Rally, as well as the MINI John Cooper Works Pro, which won the legendary 24-hour race at the Nürburgring last year. The other models of the new MINI family** complete the picture: The MINI Cooper Convertible, which celebrates its market launch in China at Auto Shanghai, as well as the MINI Cooper 3 door, MINI Cooper 5 door and MINI Aceman.\n\nThe Auto Shanghai at the National Exhibition and Convention Center has become the largest auto show in the world. More than one million visitors are expected from April 23 to May 2, 2025. Across almost 5,000 square meters, the BMW Group presents the latest products of the BMW and MINI brands. An oversized installation of the complete BMW Panoramic iDrive display and control system is the focus of the exhibition space. The road to Neue Klasse leads guests along a \"road\" across the exhibition. On display will be a BMW 1500, the historical model of the Neue Klasse from the 1960s, as well as the visionary vehicles BMW Vision Neue Klasse and BMW Vision Neue Klasse X. The BMW Group will showcase a total of 42 vehicles at its largest exhibition booth in the world.\n\nChina premiere of the BMW 3 Series 50 Years Edition**: Five decades of driving pleasure - the world's most successful premium car in a special anniversary edition. To mark the occasion in China, BMW is launching an exclusive special edition – the BMW 3 Series 50 Years Edition, limited to 2,500 units. Highlights include new paintwork, high-quality seat upholstery, specially designed 19-inch light-alloy wheels, carbon-fibre interior trim and a sports steering wheel with Alcantara trim and red 12 o'clock marker. These features combine to create a dynamic, stylish and personalised version of the iconic BMW 3 Series - offering customers in China an impressive combination of tradition and innovation.\n\nWorld premiere BMW M4 Edition Nürburgring**: BMW M celebrates more than 25 years of cooperation with the Nürburgring with the exclusive special edition BMW M4 Edition Nürburgring. This special edition vehicle, which is only available in China, is limited to just 53 units to mark the 53rd anniversary of BMW M. Specific design elements make reference to the world's most famous racetrack. The BMW Individual Frozen Deep Green metallic paint finish is a nod to the \"Green Hell\". The red Nürburgring Nordschleife logo is embroidered on the headrests and the frameless radiator grille is also framed in this striking red. The uniform \"nürburgring 1/53\" lettering in the door sills symbolises that the vehicle is part of an exclusive special edition. The edition based on the BMW M4 Competition with M xDrive has the familiar in-line six-cylinder engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and generates 390 kW/530 hp. This not only enables acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h (60 mph) in 3.5 seconds or 3.2 seconds according to the \"1-foot rollout\" method***, but also highly dynamic driving on the racetrack - tried and tested on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife, of course.\n\nBMW M235L Gran Coupé**: Luxury and sportiness are standard in the BMW M235L Gran Coupé, the second M Performance model to be produced in China and the first Gran Coupé from the plant in Shenyang. The vehicle has BMW's most powerful 2.0T four-cylinder engine, which was tuned by BMW M and delivers a peak output of 221 kW. In combination with a 7-speed DCT transmission, it accelerates the vehicle from 0 to 100 km/h (60 mph) in five seconds. M exclusive digital functions and design elements enhance the driving pleasure and sporty atmosphere. The new model's wheelbase has been extended by 110 millimetres for more rear legroom and the perfect combination of sporty driving pleasure and comfort.\n\nSensational designs: In Shanghai, BMW presents Art Car #20, designed by US artist Julie Mehretu and based on the BMW M Hybrid V8 racing car. Magical colour changes: The BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA combines the technology of changing exterior colours developed by BMW with the artistic language of South African artist Esther Mahlangu.

MINI John Cooper Works will compete again at this year's 53rd edition of the 24 Hours race at the Nürburgring. Last year, MINI achieved a spectacular triumph in the SP-3T class of the race with the near-production #317 MINI John Cooper Works Pro. The so-called \"Green Hell\" offers one of the toughest tests in motorsport with fast straights, demanding curves, and significant elevation changes. The successful cooperation with the Bulldog Racing Team will also continue this year.\n\nMINI x DEUS: Spectacular Appearance.At the starting line of this year's race, the MINI John Cooper Works will attract attention with a specially designed livery, while the Bulldog Racing Team will be exclusively dressed in the brands new season collection. The partnership is a glimpse into something the two brands MINI x DEUS are building toward.\n\n\"Our models have always been characterised by the combination of design and dynamics. Our MINI John Cooper Works, which will compete in the 24 Hours race at the Nürburgring, takes this combination to the next level: Thanks to this collaboration with Deus Ex Machina, we are setting new, exciting impulses for MINI fans and motorsport enthusiasts. Both brands are characterised by creativity and attention to detail, which allows the creation of exclusive designs with a distinctly individual style,\" explains Stefan Richmann, Head of MINI.\n\nRacing DNA meets exclusive design.For this year's 24 Hours race at the Nürburgring, the high-performance orientation of MINI John Cooper Works is combined with the passion and craftsmanship of Deus Ex Machina. The design team has pursued a consistent black and white approach in the design of the vehicle livery. The enlarged \"DEUS\" logo dominates the design as a graphic element and becomes more than just a wordmark. The unconventional, playful handling of the brand presence is typical of DEUS and gives the MINI 24 Hours race car its visual identity this year. The reduced black and white color scheme ensures that additional elements such as starting numbers or team logos are harmoniously integrated into the overall image. Hand-drawn logos on windows and other surfaces underline the raw, conceptual character of the race car, making it appear like a \"moving sketchbook\". This is intended to suggest that the Nürburgring 24 Hours race car is just a foretaste. It is the perfect first milestone in the MINI x DEUS cooperation.\n\nFor the design of the race car livery, MINI Design collaborated with Designworks. The BMW Group subsidiary has elaborated the creative idea of DEUS in detail. \"Successful brand collaborations arise when partners inspire and drive each other forward. With DEUS, MINI and Designworks, we were able to unleash a remarkable design dynamic. The DEUS livery of the MINI John Cooper Works at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is just the first proof of this,\" says Holger Hampf, Head of MINI Design.\n\nMINI Continues Its Racing Heritage.With its appearance, MINI is continuing its long-standing racing heritage. The brand has been considered an underdog in motorsports from the very beginning - and yet it has written motorsport history. The 1964 Monte Carlo Rally became a shining moment for the British Outsider. With its transversely mounted front engine and front-wheel drive, the classic Mini was the epitome of a practical small car - and proved to be a successful race car thanks to the ingenious racing engineer John Cooper. The victory in the Monte Carlo Rally was not a mere whim of fate, but the result of meticulous work. This was followed by two more victories in the famous rally in 1965 and 1967. The tradition and passion for MINI's racing heritage is still palpable and tangible in the current models. The latest MINI John Cooper Works models are characterised by their aerodynamic precision and performance-oriented four-cylinder TwinPower Turbo petrol engine.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications"}

Driving dynamics at the limits of physics: At the world's largest motor show in Shanghai, BMW presents the #BMW Vision Driving Experience, a driving experience of the highest order. Developed on the basis of the #BMW Vision Neue Klasse, the high-performance test vehicle will be unveiled to the public for the first time at Auto Shanghai 2025.\n\nInside, the lightning-fast #Heart of Joy control computer, which works in conjunction with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack to centrally calculate all driving dynamics functions, is visible in the centre console of the BMW Vision Driving Experience in Shanghai - unlike later in series production.\n\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience has been specially designed to challenge the Heart of Joy at the limits of driving physics. Test drivers Jens Klingmann and Elias Houndtonji, the main attraction of the BMW Brand Night, demonstrate the extraordinary potential of the car with spectacular driving manoeuvres. BMW presents the show's vision vehicle in a special luminescent paint.\n\n“This evening in Shanghai, BMW Group presented the most powerful prototype BMW has ever built. With up to 18,000 Nm of torque, the BMW Vision Driving Experience demonstrated Joy of Driving in its ultimate form. Equipped with our new super brain “Heart of Joy”, the VDX is converting the ultimate electric power into controlled driving pleasure - no wonder we’ve experienced overwhelming feedback from the audience” said Jochen Goller, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Customers, Brands and Sales.\n\nThe first all-electric Neue Klasse vehicles will roll off the production line at the Debrecen plant in Hungary from the end of the year. The Heart of Joy central computer, which ensures a new level of precision and driving dynamics, will be fitted as standard in every Neue Klasse vehicle.\n\nWith the visionary BMW Vision Driving Experience test vehicle, BMW is pushing the boundaries of familiar driving dynamics. With a torque of up to 18,000 Newton metres, the \"fastest test rig in the world\" is the ultimate endurance test for the Heart of Joy and BMW Dynamic Performance Control developed entirely by BMW. Thanks to active aerodynamics, the \"driving machine\" develops a downforce up to of 1.2 tonnes and lateral forces of up to 3g - a dimension on a par with Formula 1 and far beyond the requirements of conventional vehicles in road traffic. The logic behind this: If the hardware and software can tame the brute forces of this test rig, they can easily cope with the demands of everyday use.\n\nIn the new functional architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is the central computer responsible for driving, braking, recharging through recuperation and some steering functions. With fast information processing and direct control of the electric motors, the Heart of Joy not only achieves a new level of agility and driving stability with fewer system interventions, but also enables 98 per cent of braking operations to be carried out using brake energy regeneration. This represents a 25% increase in efficiency compared to today's architectures. The vehicle can also be brought to a standstill more smoothly than ever before.\n\nAlthough the BMW Vision Driving Experience was designed for development purposes only and is not intended for series production, its exterior is based on the design language of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse. The monolithic-looking body, powerful wheel arches, recessed greenhouse and \"shark nose\" front end are all part of the purist aesthetic that will also characterise the Neue Klasse. A new interpretation of the characteristic BMW radiator grille and twin headlights creates a striking, three-dimensional light signature at the front.\n\nFor the presentation in Shanghai, the BMW Vision Driving Experience, which had previously been covered in camouflage film and shown at a preview in the USA, was given an innovative, self-illuminating paint finish. The paint's special light-sensitive pigments recharge in daylight, with even the smallest amount of ambient light sufficient. In the dark, the colour varies from a whitish yellow to an expressive neon yellow, depending on the state of charge.

What a spectacular finale at the “6 Hours of Imola”, the second race of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season! Thanks to a tactical masterclass by BMW M Team WRT, the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), finished in second place. The crew of car #20 celebrated their first-ever podium in the FIA WEC – despite an early collision with another car and a repair in the pits. In the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, starting from pole position, battled for the win. After a penalty and a fantastic comeback at the end, drivers Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) celebrated a second-place finish on the podium .\n\nThe 6-hour Imola race was turbulent for all BMW M Motorsport crews. The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 started from 13th place but steadily moved up the order on the tight course. However, Rast collided with another car during an overtaking attempt, which was not his fault, severely damaging the rear wing. This required a complete rear section change during the subsequent pit stop, which the BMW M Team WRT crew accomplished in an extremely short time, thus limiting the time lost. Nevertheless, the journey from ninth place to the podium was long. To gain positions on the track, the team decided to shorten the penultimate refuelling stop, allowing them to take the lead. Van der Linde drove laps at qualifying pace to build enough time to overtake most competitors during their later final stops and cross the finish line in second place. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, with Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), started from third place and maintained that until the final hour of the race. However, the crew fell back due to performance issues and finished in sixth place.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO fought for the win right up to the finish line after an emotional rollercoaster. Al Harthy started from pole position and defended the lead during his double stint. Subsequent shifts in positions due to different strategies saw Rossi battling for first place with a Ferrari. During an overtaking attempt, he hit his opponent at the rear, for which the team received a stop-and-go penalty. That was followed by an impressive comeback by final driver van der Linde, who made up place after place and even closed the gap to the leading Porsche in the final laps. In a spectacular duel, he tried everything to snatch the victory but ultimately had to settle for second place. It was the second podium for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the second race of the season. The #31 crew with Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS), who had finished third in Qatar, experienced a troubled race this time and finished twelfth after several incidents and penalties.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to Team WRT, the drivers, and everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport on the double podium at Imola! The #20 crew did a fantastic job and, thanks to flawless performances by the drivers and perfect strategy, earned their deserved first podium in the FIA WEC. Car number 15 was performing very well for a long time after a strong qualifying, but unfortunately, it then lost performance. We need to investigate this. The podium for the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the LMGT3 class is also impressive. A podium finish in both classes and a generally strong performance of our cars – this gives us confidence for the upcoming races, where we will try to secure the first win of the year.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A great race weekend with a second place in both the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes! Additionally, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 finished sixth after encountering some issues towards the end of the race. We will investigate and find out exactly what happened. We also had various problems with car #31. It's unfortunate that it fell so far back because, by mid-race, the crew had moved up from twelfth at the start to second place. It's also frustrating for car #46, which led a large part of the race and had the speed to win – if it hadn't been for the penalty. Anyway, a double podium in the FIA WEC is always very satisfying. Next up is our home race at Spa-Francorchamps. Let's see what we can achieve there.”\n\nRené Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 2nd place): “A fantastic result – finally a podium! We didn't expect this after finishing 13th in qualifying, which didn't go as planned. But in the race, we showed how good our car and our team are. We made almost no mistakes, stayed calm, and executed well. In the end, a bit of luck was also involved, but we had so much bad luck in the last races that we now deserve to celebrate.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 6th place): “I'm happy for the #20 crew that they made it to the podium. They had a lot of bad luck last season. On our side of the garage, we can't be satisfied. Things were going well for a long time, but as the race progressed, we lost performance. Now we need to look at and understand how this happened. We all know how fast Dries is in the car. When I handed over to him, I thought it could be our day but then the problem occurred.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place LMGT3 class): “I have mixed feelings because a podium is a good result, but we could have won. It's very unfortunate because the team did a fantastic job, the car was very fast, and we managed the tyres well. Ahmad and especially Kelvin at the end drove brilliantly. Kelvin fought until the end and brought the podium home. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and hit the Ferrari in front of me during an overtaking attempt. The subsequent penalty cost us the win. I am sorry for that.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 12th place LMGT3 class): “There are races where everything just goes wrong. This was one of those races. We had a great car with great speed, but we just couldn't capitalise on it. That's hard to accept because it doesn't happen every time that you have such a strong package available. We made too many mistakes – and luck was also not on our side but the championship is still open. We now need to focus on the next race.”"}

In this eventful endurance marathon, the BMW teams demonstrated the potential of the BMW M 1000 RR. The private team ERC Endurance #6 celebrated a podium finish with third place. The factory team, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team (#37), was also among the top favourites and crossed the line in fourth place after 24 turbulent hours.\n\nAfter dry weather up until Friday, rain began right on schedule on race day Saturday. The track became extremely slippery, resulting in numerous crashes throughout the field. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with factory riders Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), Markus Reiterberger (GER), Steven Odendaal (GER), and reserve rider Hannes Soomer (EST) was not spared. The #37 BMW M 1000 RR led the field with a solid advantage during the chaotic early stages but over the following hours, the team – like nearly all others – suffered crashes and had to take a lengthy repair break. Nevertheless, Guintoli, Reiterberger, and Odendaal fought their way back, keeping their podium hopes alive.\n\nBMW Motorrad Motorsport was represented on the Le Mans podium by ERC Endurance #6, with riders Kenny Foray (FRA), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), and David Checa (ESP). The trio showed strong pace throughout race week with their #6 BMW M 1000 RR and rewarded themselves with third place.\n\nIn addition to these teams, four other private BMW squads competed at Le Mans. In the Superstock class, Team Étoile from Japan narrowly missed the podium, finishing fourth. On the #25 BMW M 1000 RR, riders Hikari Okubo, Kazuki Watanabe, and Motoharu Ito (all JPN) shared duties. The Hungarian Endurance Racing Team by Moto Jungle claimed the celebrated pole position in the Superstock class with the #713 BMW M 1000 RR. However, the race also proved to be eventful for this Hungarian trio – Bálint Kovács, Máté Számado, and Soma Görbe. On Sunday morning, the #713 had to head into the pits but returned to the track for the final lap, crossing the finish line to the cheers of the team. Team LRP Poland, with riders Danny Webb, Michael Dunlop (both GBR), and Enzo Boulom (FRA) on the #90 BMW M 1000 RR, was forced to retire late in the evening. The French team T2C Racing (#2 BMW S 1000 RR) also retired early in the evening.\n\nThe second race of the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship, the 8 Hours of Spa Motos at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), will take place on June 7.\n\nReactions after the 24h Le Mans:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This 24-hour race is one we’ll all remember for a long time. The challenge of riding a race like Le Mans under such conditions was immense for everyone involved. That makes the strong performance of the BMW teams and riders all the more impressive. Congratulations to the entire ERC Endurance #6 team who managed to reach the podium in their first race in this lineup. Our factory team also proved its podium potential right to the very end. Many thanks to the team and the riders for their hard work and strong performance. What we saw at Le Mans gives us a lot of confidence for the rest of the FIM EWC season.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an absolutely emotional experience all around. Le Mans is always impressive, and endurance racing is full of passion. I think that passion was evident from the first to the last lap. The riders had to take big risks in extremely difficult conditions. By hour 22, there had already been more than 145 crashes – surely a record, but a sad one. Teams put in so much work and heart, and only a few got the reward. It was a real sporting challenge, and we’re very happy to have a BMW M 1000 RR on the podium. Congratulations to Uwe Reinhardt and the ERC crew. Our Werner Daemen-led factory team fought right to the last minute. We had crashes with all three riders; it was just that tough out there. Plus, we had a follow-up repair that cost us about 15 minutes, which was likely the small margin that kept us from the podium. We were a bit unlucky, but we’re happy with the many points we’re taking home. It’s a solid foundation for the rest of the season, and we’re looking forward to Spa, Werner Daemen’s home race. I think that track suits our BMW M 1000 RR well. You could already see its potential here.”\n\nKenny Foray, ERC Endurance #6: “The feeling is just incredible. It was an absolutely crazy race. I think it is not possible to imagine how we feel on the bike when you watch so many crashes like this. And when you go to your hospitality to take some rest and you see more crashes on TV, and you know that you soon have to be back on the bike again – this was really, really difficult. We had some problems but we did not crash, we stayed on the bike, and I think that was the key of the race. It is just an incredible moment. This is the first race for the team with the BMW M 1000 RR and we start with a podium. That is fantastic!”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik, ERC Endurance #6: “It feels nice because when you change the team you also want to have good results. Despite the fact that we did not ride or test a lot this winter we showed immediately, without any track time, our performance. It was great to be so competitive during the weekend and in the end, we were on the podium. I want to say a big thank you to BMW for the support and to Uwe Reinhardt, the Team Principal. It was a nice present for him and also for David, who has his birthday today.”\n\nDavid Checa, ERC Endurance #6: “First of all, I am so happy to ride with BMW. It was my first experience with them and I was so excited because the engine is incredible. It has a lot of power from first to sixth gear and the bike is so easy to ride compared to the others I rode before. I just need to understand how to manage it but Ilya and Kenny have a lot of experience. They help me a lot to learn this bike. Step by step I will get to their rhythm because at the moment I am not yet on the level of Kenny and Ilya but I did my best. We did not expect to be on the podium as we did not test, but sometimes it happens! I am so happy to be back with Kenny and to be on the Le Mans podium with him.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I’ve done a lot of 24-hour races, but I’ve never experienced one as chaotic and slippery as today. There were so many crashes, and unfortunately, we went down three times as well. My teammates did a fantastic job. They were both really fast at the beginning but each had a crash. I then tried to bring it home but also slipped once. We were definitely in the fight, but it just wasn’t meant to be. Finishing fourth is a bit frustrating because we really wanted and deserved that podium. But it's clear we have the potential and we can fight for wins. Big thanks to my teammates and the entire team. It was an amazing week!”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was mad. It was really frantic from the very start because the track was very, very slippery. The 24 hours started really well. In the first one and a half hours, I felt really good and was leading. Then I got caught up with a backmarker and unfortunately crashed. The team did a fantastic job to repair the bike – and then again after Steven’s crash. They were really, really on point. Unfortunately we lost a bit too much time with the damage on the bike but I think everybody can be really proud of what we did today. It just wasn’t to be but we had speed, we were leading for quite a while and we were strong. There are still a lot of positives to take from this weekend and I think we are all very much looking forward to the next rounds.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “To be honest, it has definitely been the most difficult race of my life. I’ve never had to experience such terrible conditions during the night and during the day. A wet track drying and a dry track getting wet again, but I think the team did really well. We had some really big crashes and the team prepared the bike phenomenally well to get it back to working order. I am really happy, it was just unfortunate. It would have been nice to end up on the podium after all the troubles we had.”\n\nQualifying (combined).\n\nTati Team AVA6 Racing\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nCurrent World Championship standings (R01/04).\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team"}

We are particularly pleased to start the FUTURE ACES programme here at MTTC Iphitos with our partners by Pentecost. A total of 361 coaching hours for disadvantaged children and youth were earned through the aces hit during the tournament.“\n\nEach ace during the tournament results in a donated coaching hour for children and youths facing challenging circumstances. They are given the opportunity to learn tennis, develop personally in a safe and supportive environment, make connections, and gain valuable experiences. Participants are offered diverse opportunities to discover their potential and build skills, empowering them to start a self-determined life.\n\nTop-seeded Zverev started into the final highly focused, breaking Shelton's serve right at the beginning. He continued to control the match, winning the first set 6-2 after another break. The second set started like the first, with the American losing his serve. In front of his girlfriend, Trinity Rodman, daughter of former basketball star Dennis Rodman, a US national soccer player and 2024 Olympic champion, Shelton failed to earn even a single break point. Zverev, on the other hand, continued to play almost flawlessly and was celebrated by the enthusiastic spectators at his 12th BMW Open appearance for his third title, including a birthday serenade.\n\n“Without you, I wouldn't be here today with the trophy; you brought me back on Friday. It was a beautiful atmosphere and a great tournament week. Thank you,“ Zverev said to the audience, referring to the quarterfinal against Dutch player Tallon Griekspoor, who had served for the match in the second set but was ultimately defeated by Zverev. “It was wonderful to experience the premiere as an ATP-500 event, and I think it's great that the tournament officials are not standing still but always want to make everything even better. I will come back next year and am already looking forward to it.”\n\nThe BMW iX M70 in “Frozen Deep Grey“ was driven onto Center Court by former tennis pro and 2020 US Open winner Dominic Thiem (AUT). LAST NAME can now look forward to experiencing up to 25 percent increased drive performance, significantly improved efficiency, and a maximum range of 701 kilometres in the WLTP cycle in the new BMW iX M70. Like the winner's vehicle, the BMW courtesy car fleet during the tournament was also locally emission-free. It consisted of all-electric BMW i7, BMW i5, BMW iX, and BMW iX1 vehicles.\n\nA second German victory was prevented on the final Sunday by Swedish André Göransson and Sem Verbeek from the Netherlands with their triumph in the doubles competition. Göransson/Verbeek defeated the top-seeded German duo Kevin Krawietz and Tim Pütz 6-4; 6-4. At the Allianz Para Trophy, held as part of the BMW Open and featuring a world-class field, Alfie Hewett (GBR) celebrated a double victory. In the singles final, the world number one defeated Argentine Gustavo Fernandez 7-6; 6-3. With his partner Gordon Reid (GBR), he also secured the doubles title with a three-set victory (6-0; 5-7; 10-4) against Joachim Gerard (BEL) and Maikel Scheffers (NED).\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX M70 xDrive: WLTP combined (EnVKV): Energy consumption 23.5 kWh/100km; CO2 emissions 0 g/km; CO2 class A."}

As a long-term supporter of the fair, BMW will showcase the iconic 4th BMW Art Car, painted by Andy Warhol in just 28 minutes in 1979, on the fairground. The display of Warhol’s BMW M1 at Art Dubai is part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary BMW Art Car Collection this year.\n\nFounded in 2007, Art Dubai has established itself as the most significant global art gathering in the Middle East, playing a pivotal role in the rapid growth of the region’s art scene and creative economy. Each year, the fair features around 120 contemporary, modern, and digital galleries from over 40 countries, showcasing a diverse range of artistic talent and positions. The gallery programme is complemented by artist commissions, an ambitious education initiative, and the most extensive talks and conference programming of any international art fair, including the renowned Global Art Forum and the annual Digital Summit. Art Dubai continues to champion galleries and artists from less-represented geographies, serving as a vital gateway for discovery, learning, and cultural exchange.\n\nAs part of the fair’s talk series, BMW will host the exclusive Art Talk “Driven by Art: Are Commissions and Co-creations the Future?” on 17th April at the Auditorium of Art Dubai. The international panalists Azu Nwagbogu (Founder and Director African Artists' Foundation and LagosPhoto Festival), Hans Ulrich Obrist (Artistic Director SERPENTINE) and Dr Stephanie Rosenthal (Director Guggenheim Abu Dhabi Project) will explore the rise of co-creation as cultural phenomenon. Taking the iconic BMW Art Car Initiative as a point of departure, the panelists will reflect on decades of artistic collaborations they themselves initiated through their curatorial practice and institutions, moderated by Prof Dr Thomas Girst (Global Head of BMW Group Cultural Engagement).\n\nThe BMW Art Car World Tour and its stop in DubaiThis year marks the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection – an unprecedented mix of technology, art, and design that began in 1975 when French racing driver Hervé Poulain invited artist Alexander Calder to paint a BMW 3.0 CSL. Since then, the project has brought together visionary artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Esther Mahlangu, Jeff Koons, and Julie Mehretu, each transforming a BMW vehicle into a “rolling sculpture“. To celebrate this milestone, BMW has launched a global BMW Art Car World Tour to showcase the collection at cultural institutions, museums and platforms on all five continents.\n\nIn 1979, Andy Warhol transformed the BMW M1 into a radical canvas - a car that blurred the lines between art, performance and design. The exhibition of Warhol's BMW Art Car at this year's edition of Art Dubai underlines BMW's ongoing support for the arts and its commitment to fostering artistic dialogue and cultural exchange in the region. As part of the BMW Art Car World Tour 2025, Dubai joins this historic celebration of the series on tour."}

As it pulls back the curtain on a new era in 2025, fuelled by the all-electric Neue Klasse models, BMW is creating a holistic driving and user experience that breaks genuinely new ground. One of the elements of the far-reaching BMW Panoramic iDrive concept is the new HypersonX soundscape. Developed by the BMW Group Sound Design Studio, it comprises 43 sound signals and special driving sounds for Personal Mode and Sport Mode. The multi-dimensional spectrum adapts the sounds precisely to the driving situation at hand and, in so doing, creates an emotional interaction between the driver and their vehicle.\n\nThis new stage in the evolution of the automotive sound experience has been made possible by the technological advances in hardware and software brought by the Neue Klasse. The revolutionary BMW Operating System X and a newly developed control unit pave the way for an innovative audio architecture. This allows the overall experience offered by the Neue Klasse to be perfected at an acoustic level, as well as in terms of vehicle character, driving experience and functional range.\n\nA new dimension in drive sounds: distinctive and precisely honed.\n\n“The unique sound spectrum of HypersonX plays a major role in giving a Neue Klasse model its own, highly distinctive character acoustically. Through our focus on precision, warmth and lightness, we can create a direct emotional connection between the driver and their vehicle,” emphasises Renzo Vitale, Creative Director of Sound Design BMW Group. In both Personal Mode and Sport Mode, the drive sounds focus on the essentials and are inspired by tones from nature and structures from the worlds of art and science. HypersonX has fewer basic notes than the sound experience previously employed. But at the same time, the acoustic spectrum has grown to include a new dimensional level. This gives the sound more “colour”, depth and precision, and it embodies more than ever the pleasure of driving for which BMW is renowned.\n\nOne of the main elements underpinning this capability is the audio control unit developed for the Neue Klasse, which enables a significant expansion of the dynamic range.\n\nAdded to which, the spatial modulation of the drive sound achievable in the Neue Klasse ensures that the vehicle occupants are thoroughly immersed in the soundscape generated by HypersonX. Under acceleration, for example, the vehicle gives the impression of moving between different three-dimensional layers of sound, thus transporting the feeling of speed and BMW-typical driving dynamics authentically into the cabin.\n\nHumanity is a central design element of the welcome sound.\n\nAs well as intelligent reduction to the essential elements, the human aspect played an important role in the development of the soundscape for the Neue Klasse. The middle and lower frequency ranges of the BMW HypersonX sound spectrum have been brought to the fore to create a well-balanced acoustic ambience. In conjunction with intuitive operation, precisely adjusted light effects and homely interior design, this gives those on board a fine sense of wellbeing.\n\nA choir made up of BMW Group Design Studio employees brings voice – in their respective native languages – to moments of driving joy, infusing the welcome sound with a particularly empathetic flavour. Carefully isolated elements of these recordings enhance the overall composition of the welcome sound to excellent effect and treat the driver to moments of joy and human warmth.\n\nBMW HypersonX gives the sounds for the Neue Klasse an expressive and distinctive, but also understated and sensitive feel. To this end, more than nine million sound instances based on BMW’s sound DNA were generated using a new algorithm. At the BMW Group Sound Design Studio, these were then filtered into a brand-typical essence that in turn generates a cohesive and multi-dimensional acoustic experience. The result is a sound that creates an emotional connection between human and vehicle in all driving situations and brings a positive, congenial and inviting aura to the acoustic presence of the Neue Klasse."}

For BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, the FIM Superbike World Championship round at Assen (NED) was an eventful weekend highlighted by an outstanding victory from Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) in the Superpole Race and valuable points for the championship standings. “El Turco” won the Sunday morning sprint on his BMW M 1000 RR with a commanding lead, celebrating his first-ever rain victory in WorldSBK. His teammate and local hero Michael van der Mark (NED) put on a sensational charge in the sprint race, fighting his way from 13th on the grid to finish fifth. In the two main races, however, both riders struggled with issues. Razgatlioglu had to settle for fourth and eighth places, while van der Mark came home ninth and seventeenth. Despite that, Razgatlioglu, second overall in the standings, managed to reduce his deficit to championship leader Nicolò Bulega (ITA), who failed to score points on Sunday due to technical issues. The fourth round of the 2025 WorldSBK season will take place in three weeks’ time (2nd to 4th May) in Cremona, Italy.\n\nReactions after the Assen round:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a weekend of great highs, but also of tough setbacks. I think we need to stay positive and look ahead. We’re still at the beginning of the season. We showed in the Superpole Race that we are fundamentally capable of winning, but our overall package isn’t yet at the level where we can perform consistently. Toprak and Mickey both did a great job, especially under mixed conditions. The sprint race was really impressive, and I believe it gave us a real energy boost. On the other hand, the second main race in particular showed us that there’s still a lot of work to do. We now need to use the time until Cremona to take the next step. I’m confident that although the team had a tough afternoon today, we’ll push hard again tomorrow to prepare for Cremona.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “In the Superpole Race in wet conditions I felt very good on the bike and the grip also seemed to be not bad. It was special because it was also my first win in my WorldSBK career in wet conditions. That makes me very happy. For race two in dry conditions we tried a different setup but it was still not working. Yesterday, we had a very big drop on the rear tyre, so this time we used the standard SC0 tyre but it started to get blisters on the right side. It was not easy to ride the bike. For some laps I thought if it would be better to enter the box but I also thought about the points so I just tried to get the best possible position, and then I also saw that Nicolò Bulega’s bike was stopping in the first corner. I am not happy for this, even if it was good for me as I am now 21 points behind him. But the season is very long and we have still many races to go. I just focus on my job and hope we come back stronger because we need to improve the bike and to fight again for the win. Now we are going to Cremona. Last year I was just riding there for one day during the test. I did 40 or 50 laps, not more. I missed the races there, I just watched them on TV so I don’t know what to expect there. I will just try to do my best again and hope we will find a good setup immediately.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The weekend started off alright on Friday. I was able to improve here and there and was quite happy with the bike. Then on Saturday, we had an issue in the morning so we stayed in in FP3. In Superpole, I felt good but I was not fast enough. In yesterday’s race, coming from P13, I had a good start and really enjoyed the first half of the race but then had a massive drop in the tyres and just stumbled back. In the end, I finished ninth, which wasn’t bad but also not fantastic. This morning’s Superpole Race was in wet conditions with the track drying. I was looking forward to it and to use my experience. I had a good start and a really enjoyable race. I made a mistake and ran off track in a big battle and finished fifth. That was quite positive and I enjoyed it. I wish I could have been on the podium in the Superpole Race but I just messed it up a little bit. I then had a good starting position for race two. Another good start, but I just didn’t have the right feeling with the grip. I tried to stay with the group for a long time but then I made a mistake. So I pushed to stay with the other group but for some reason there was no performance in the bike in the afternoon.

In terms of qualifying speed, the BMW M Hybrid V8 remains the benchmark in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) season after three races. Dries Vanthoor (BEL) completed the pole position hat-trick at the street circuit in Long Beach (USA), following Daytona and Sebring (both USA), driving car number 24. In the race, Vanthoor's teammate Philipp Eng (AUT) crossed the finish line in third place after 100 minutes, securing the first podium for BMW M Team RLL this season. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER) finished fifth in the sister car after a strong comeback .\n\nIn qualifying, Vanthoor once again shone with an impressive lap time that secured him the pole position. Only van der Linde in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 could match the pace, finishing second to complete the front row entirely in BMW M Motorsport's hands. In the race, both BMW M Team RLL cars initially took the lead, but they lost valuable positions during a pit stop in the first yellow phase. Particularly Wittmann, who took over the number 25 from van der Linde, had to fight hard to move up from tenth to fifth place. Eng only had to let the two Porsches at the front go and ultimately drove home a solid third place.\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport competed with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) finished in fifth place.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The third pole position in the third race of the season for Dries Vanthoor and the complete front row in BMW M Motorsport's hands – that was fantastic. We have the speed, but unfortunately, we were not completely error-free in the race, which cost us the chance of winning. We lost valuable positions during the pit stops. Nevertheless, the first podium of the season for Dries Vanthoor and Philipp Eng is a success we can build on. The comeback by Marco Wittmann and Sheldon van der Linde after losing time during the pit stop was strong. Now we need to work even harder to convert our pace into the first win of the season next time.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 3rd place): “Starting from the first and second positions, this is obviously not the result we had hoped for. Unfortunately, we had a small issue during the pit stop, which caused us to fall behind the two Porsches. If we had stayed ahead, I think we could have kept them behind us. It's still a podium, but it's a pity because more was possible. Nevertheless, we are on the right track, and we will come back stronger in Laguna Seca.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 5th place): “Even though I managed a good comeback to fifth place, the disappointment prevails after this result. We were in first and second place in all practices and qualifying, so you naturally expect more than third and fifth places in the race. We made a strategic mistake with the timing of our pit stop during the yellow phase with our number 25, which almost threw us to the back of the GTP field. We need to learn from this and convert the strong pace that the BMW M Hybrid V8 has into top results next time.”"}

The start of the Endurance Cup season of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS could hardly have gone better from the perspective of BMW M Motorsport. The new BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved an overall victory, a class win, and a podium finish in every category at the 6 Hours of Paul Ricard at Le Castellet (FRA). The Team WRT trio of Charles Weerts, Ugo de Wilde (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) celebrated their race win on the podium. In the Silver Cup, Paradine Competition drove the #992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO to victory, while car #991 finished second in the Bronze Cup. In the Gold Cup, AlManar Racing by Team WRT secured third place .\n\nThe #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO started the race from ninth position but steadily improved throughout the race. As darkness fell and the track cooled down, the car got faster, and about 1:45 hours before the end, van der Linde took the lead which he confidently maintained until the finish. The South African celebrated his second prestigious victory with Team WRT after the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS). It was also a particularly special triumph for Ugo de Wilde, as he managed to win right away in his debut as a BMW M works driver.\n\nThe Le Castellet race was a complete success for the BMW M Motorsport teams beyond the overall victory. Paradine Competition had double reason to celebrate. In the Silver Cup, the victory went to the #992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO driven by James Kellett, Charles Clark (both GBR), and Pedro Ebrahim (BRA). In the Bronze Cup, BMW M works driver Dan Harper, team owner Darren Leung (both GBR), and Sean Gelael (INA) in the #991 car finished second.

The drivers Charles Weerts, Kelvin van der Linde, and Ugo de Wilde can be very proud of their performances. Ugo de Wilde won his first race as a BMW M works driver right away – that's fantastic! Overall, our BMW M4 GT3 EVO made an excellent debut in this prestigious racing series. Many thanks to everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport and the teams that made these successes possible! We celebrated the overall win and a class victory, and stood on the podium with a crew in every class. Congratulations to Paradine Competition and AlManar Racing by Team WRT. Our record in Le Castellet is truly impressive.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am thrilled; it was a fantastic race for customer racing with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. This morning in qualifying, it didn't look like we would be going home with a podium in almost all classes. Jens Klingmann fought for the win in the Gold category until the end, and Darren Leung's team can be proud of their victory in the Silver class and second place in the Bronze category. All teams and drivers did a great job at the start of the GT World Challenge. I hope it continues like this.”\n\nVincent Vosse (WRT Team Principal): “Again, it was great teamwork! For a bit of history, we haven’t won here since 2012 and we’ve been close a few times but always a bit unlucky. To be able to achieve this strong result is mega. I’m super happy for Ugo who did his first race with us! It is such a nice way to start and to take off a little bit of pressure. I’m of course very sorry for car #30, those things happen in racing. Until then they were doing quite well. A great job from #777 with their 3rd place in Gold Cup. A great start of the season!”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1st place): “A very good weekend, I’m very happy! We didn’t expect it at all but it’s the kind of surprise we love to have. The team did an amazing job, our car was really nice to drive, so a big thank you to the team and to BMW M Motorsport but also my two teammates. First time we drove together, and we got a win straight away. Super proud and super happy to be driving with them. Let’s try to keep it going like we did and I’m sure we will have a successful year.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1st place): “It was a very surprising win for us. After qualifying our main target was to finish in the top-five and to score points, but to be fighting for a podium and even a win was unexpected and makes it even sweeter. Big shout out to Charles, he’s been really good. I think it’s one of hist best drives. Same for Ugo that we threw in a deep end in such a competitive championship, and he did really well. He made no mistakes, and he established him well this weekend. I’m looking forward to seeing how he progresses throughout the season.”\n\nUgo de Wilde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1st place): “Round one is done, and I can’t believe what has just happened! It’s amazing to start my journey with BMW M Motorsport with a win. It was a really educational weekend for me, it was great to finally start racing with Charles, Kelvin and Team WRT. It was not easy at the start and we were not expecting to finish on the podium. We will keep working and try to focus on Monza then on the biggest one, 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Thanks a lot to BMW M Motorsport and to WRT!”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 6th place): “We had literally everything in this race. All kinds of possible things did not go our way but in the end we brought it home despite the issues that we had which was good. But for BMW M Motorsport it was an incredible weekend. The wins and podium finishes show how strong the EVO car is and we have enough reason to celebrate.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT, 3rd place Gold Cup): “Super happy to kick off the season with a podium. I think the top-ten overall with our Gold Cup car is an amazing result. We didn’t have the pace in the end to fight for more even though we were so close to P2, but P1 was out of reach. I think we can be proud and happy with what we achieved tonight. We executed everything very well. The harmony in the team and in our driver crew is really good. I can’t wait for the rest of the season.”\n\nDarren Leung (Team Principal and driver Paradine Competition): “First race for our Silver car and the first time we were running two cars, so I am extremely happy that the first result is a class win. I am very proud of everyone involved. Unfortunately for the 991 we had three full course yellows that helped our competitors otherwise we could have won that, too. All in all todays results I think are a very good sign for the season to come.”\n\nDan Harper (#991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition, 2nd place Bronze Cup): “It was a challenging weekend from the start. We lacked a bit of pace at the beginning of the weekend. However, in the end, we had a brilliant race, securing a podium finish. We came close to a victory, but the full course yellow periods played in favour of our competitors. That's how it goes sometimes, but considering our practice sessions and qualifying performance, we can be very pleased with this podium result. Thank you to the whole Paradine team, they did a great job.”"}

With one day to go before the first serve at the BMW Open by Bitpanda (April 12-20, 2025, MTCC Iphitos), further key details for the premiere of the iconic tournament as an ATP 500 event were presented this Friday: the Winner's Car and the FUTURE ACES program initiated by the BMW Group.\n\n“As with the BMW Open by Bitpanda, the BMW iX is a success story that has been significantly enhanced for the year 2025. The new BMW iX impresses with up to 25% higher drive power, significantly improved efficiency and a range of up to 701 kilometres in the WLTP cycle,“ said Ach. “More performance, more sportiness, a more dynamic design than ever before– making it the perfect Winner's Car for the ATP 500 premiere.“\n\nStarting this year, there will be additional winners at the BMW Open by Bitpanda, beyond the singles and doubles champions. This is ensured by the long-term programme FUTURE ACES, which aims to provide socially disadvantaged children and youths from Munich with access to tennis and open up expanded future prospects for them. For FUTURE ACES, partners of the BMW Open by Bitpanda have come together, initiated by the BMW Group, foremost among them MTTC Iphitos and organizer MMP.\n\n“It is important for the BMW Group to make a relevant contribution to the common good and to actively shape social projects – especially in sports. We keep a firm focus on participation and equal opportunities because they are decisive factors for the prosperity and cohesion of our society,“ said Ach. “We are very pleased that FUTURE ACES – a programme that will work precisely in this direction – is now launching, and that our BMW Open partners are supporting it with great enthusiasm. This wonderful collaboration has made the growth of the tournament possible and will now hopefully also sustainably improve the future prospects of many young people.“\n\nEvery ace during the tournament results in a donated coaching session at MTTC Iphitos for children and youths with challenging starts. They get the opportunity to learn tennis, develop personally in a safe and supportive environment, make connections, and gain valuable experiences. They are accompanied by mentors from the partners, who act as motivators and provide guidance for their professional and personal future. This is complemented by offerings such as information days and internships in the club and BMW Open environment. Thus, participants receive various opportunities to discover their potentials and develop skills, thereby starting a self-determined life as FUTURE ACES.\n\nTherefore, every ace in the singles and doubles competitions of the BMW Open by Bitpanda is doubly important.

Focused uncompromisingly on riding dynamics, it delivers a far sportier experience than its predecessor thanks to a completely redesigned engine and chassis, while still retaining core BMW values such as touring capability and comfort.\"Christof Lischka, Head of Development BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R: the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is noticeably sportier both technically and visually, featuring dynamic styling for an aggressive, athletic design. Four attractive model variants.\n\nThe goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 R was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the dynamic roadster with boxer engine. Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 R remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 1300 R is offered in Snapper Rocks metallic, with additional variants including the Exclusive variant in Racing blue metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium Option 719 Kilauea in Blackstorm metallic.\n\nSporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun and touring comfort.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 R significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new BMW R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. Optional Comfort handlebars are also available.\n\nA range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height, while a newly developed luggage system with electrified cases and a clever tank bag makes the bike ideal for comfortable touring and holiday trips.\n\nFor many years, BMW’s roadsters with boxer engine have enjoyed an excellent reputation among female customers and restarters in particular. This is thanks to their good accessibility and low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 R again placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of well below 790 mm. In addition to the standard seat, several others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor touring and holiday rides, the new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with a newly developed case system and case holders from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment ex works. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 R has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 R has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 R can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 R has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 R has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 R also features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels. The reduced rotational masses result in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimised handling qualities.\n\nNew electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA), with dynamic adjustment of the damping, spring rate and load compensation as optional equipment. The world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.\n\nWith its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear, the standard electronic Dynamic ESA itself offers a high level of riding safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. This makes the new BMW R 1300 R the first series production motorcycle with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring rest. With DSA, the rider benefits from even more refined handling and increased banking freedom.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 R comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nStandard full LED headlight in dynamic octagonal design and state-of-the-art LED lighting throughout. Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 R comes as standard with a newly designed LED headlight in a dynamic octagonal shape, featuring a distinctive light icon.\n\nWith the optional Adaptive Turning Light, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimised for cornering, depending on the banking position, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimising the light pattern, the dipped beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW) for safe and comfortable motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R can be equipped with the Riding Assistant for even safer and more comfortable motorcycling. This includes Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW).\n\nFor the first time, navigation preparation now features electric unlocking for maximum operating comfort as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThis item of ex works optional equipment allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a mount cradle. For the first time, this holder no longer requires a key – it unlocks electrically for maximum convenience.\n\nOptional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nAn extensive program of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW R 1300 R:"}

Success is teamwork – this applies to the BMW Group in close collaboration with its external partners as much as it does to successful athletes. Continuous training, constant optimisation and the will to develop are essential in both worlds. With the Partner Academy, the BMW Group is focusing precisely on that. Qualifications and further education are the keys to achieving top performances together with its partners and suppliers, and to securing long-term success.\n\nSuperbike world champion and BMW Motorrad factory rider Toprak Razgatlioglu knows that continuous development and collaboration take quality to the next level. He has benefitted from targeted training and a strong team on his way to the top of his sport, while the BMW Group also relies on perfect collaboration with excellent partners.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu: The world title – a joint project\n\n”Everything is teamwork,” Razgatlioglu explained when asked about the secret of his success in the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship. “Working hard on the racetrack every day is not enough to win, but if your team is working hard every day, this is the perfect package.

This will be the first time that all of the still-surviving original body variants of the BMW 328 that lined up for the 1940 Mille Miglia have come together to be displayed – so it is a truly unique occurrence. The cars include the victorious BMW 328 Touring Coupé and the legendary BMW 328 “Mille Miglia” Series 1 roadster (nicknamed the “Trouser Crease Roadster”). BMW finished the race in 1st, 3rd, 5th and 6th places, and also won the prize for regularity and the team award in all classes.\n\nBMW Group Classic will bring a number of cars from its collection to Cernobbio to help mark a handful of other anniversaries.

Meanwhile, a pair of BMW icons from the 1950s – the BMW 507 and 503 – notch up their 70th birthdays this year and will be integrated across the event programme in fitting style. Not to be forgotten and likewise on the Lake Como bill will be the BMW Isetta, itself turning 70 in 2025. The 50th anniversary of the legendary BMW Art Cars will be embodied by Sandro Chia’s Art Car no. 13 (a BMW M3 GTR). Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is also celebrating a special milestone, the centenary of the launch of the very first Phantom – the pinnacle model in the marque’s portfolio.\n\nOn Sunday, 25 May, the “Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este Public Day – Il Festival” will once again give the wider public the opportunity to experience the parade of all the cars in the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. This fascinating day in the divine gardens of the nearby Villa Erba will lay on an automotive feast for all ages.\n\nThe “Amici & Automobili – Wheels & Weisswürscht” event format familiar to many from its Munich roots and now also an established fixture on the shores of Lake Como will also be part of the festival weekend in 2025. On Saturday, 24 May, automotive enthusiasts, and car clubs & communities from around the world will show off their automotive gems in the grounds of Villa Erba. 150 vehicles are expected – rich in variety, spread across brands and including Italian classics from the Veteran Car Club Como.\n\nThe “Trofeo BMW Group – Best of Show” winner will be the recipient of a special timepiece from A. Lange & Söhne: the unique 1815 CHRONOGRAPH in 18-carat white gold with solid pink gold dial and hand-engraved Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d‘Este crest on the hinged cuvette.

The special exhibition of all the surviving cars that raced to glorious overall victory for BMW in the 1940 Mille-Miglia is particularly close to my heart. Guests can experience this and much more – not only at Villa d’Este but also once again on the public days in the gardens of Villa Erba.”\n\nDavide Bertilaccio, CEO Villa d'Este Hotels:\n\n“The Concorso d'Eleganza has been part of the history and tradition of Villa d'Este for almost a century now, and we feel honoured to be able to welcome vehicle owners from around the world – together with cars of rare beauty and value – year in, year out.

Schubert Motorsport gathered valuable experience with its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs and BMW M factory drivers René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER). At the end of the two sessions on Wednesday, more than 250 test laps were recorded.\n\nThe focus of the tests for the team and both drivers was to familiarise themselves as much as possible with the EVO version of the BMW M4 GT3 in combination with the new Pirelli tyres that are used in the DTM. Rast completed 129 laps in the #33 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, which featured a new design from BMW M Motorsport partner RoboMarkets, and recorded a personal best time of 1:23.394 minutes. Wittmann completed 132 laps in his “Green Machine”, the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in Schaeffler colours, achieving a best time of 1:23.091 minutes.

The focus was on completing as many laps as possible and working through the extensive test programme. The Pirelli tyres are new to everyone, and it's particularly important to test how they perform on a long run. We will only find out where we stand in terms of lap times compared to the competition during the race weekend. Generally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, we aim to achieve victories and titles in the biggest GT racing series and at the most important single events worldwide. Endless, as a brake specialist with outstanding expertise, assists us in this endeavour. Together, we have worked on optimising our GT3 car, and we have already celebrated our first successes. I am very pleased that we were able to further expand our partnership with a view to the coming years and join forces worldwide.”\n\nLucas Nylund (CEO Endless Brake Technology Europe): “Since we started to collaborate with BMW M Motorsport in 2020, we have always felt very welcome within the BMW M Motorsport family as the supplier of high-quality racing brake technology, and we are happy to match the high expectations of BMW M Motorsport on all parts of their GT3 cars. To extend our partnership with BMW M Motorsport is a fantastic opportunity which we are very proud of, and we are looking forward to continuing our shared success story and to work even closer together with BMW M Motorsport by supporting their global GT3 programme. We would like to thank Andreas Roos, the drivers, the engineers, and the entire staff at BMW M Motorsport for their trust in Endless and for the further expanded partnership for the coming years. We will do our very best to achieve even more victories and to further continue our long-lasting success story.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “The anticipation for the DTM season is high, and the official test drives are always a great start to the intensive phase. We completed a full test programme, and I was able to spend a lot of time in the car. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt good. Compared to its predecessor, it offers a larger operating window, which will hopefully help us to better adapt the car to the specific challenges that the DTM presents than last year. We are currently experimenting in this area so that we can benefit from it from the first race weekend onwards.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I drove the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time and used the test day to get accustomed to the car. Even though there are few external changes, there are quite a few new features under the hood. Lap times have not yet played a role for us. That will be the focus in a few weeks when we compete in our first races at Oschersleben. I am hoping for good results and am very excited to participate in this high-class DTM field.”"}

With a total of six victories for the first time in the categories “Sports Bikes”, “Crossover”, “Power Nakeds, “Adventure Touring” “Tourers/Sport Tourers” and “Enduros/Supermotos” as well as a second place and two third places, BMW Motorrad achieved another outstanding result in MOTORRAD magazine’s readers' choice \"Motorcycle of the Year 2025\".\n\n\"Together with the entire BMW Motorrad team, I am very pleased to have won nine awards and to have won six categories for the first time. The fact that three M models once again came out on top in the readers' choice is a strong endorsement of the appeal of our M model range. And the victory of our F 900 GS/Adventure for the first time is clear proof of the high level of acceptance of this off-road all-rounder. On behalf of the entire BMW Motorrad team, I would like to thank the readers of MOTORRAD magazine for their tremendous support. These awards are also a great confirmation of our claim to inspire our customers and fans with the best offers in the various segments with a highly attractive product range and to further consolidate our leading position in the premium motorcycle market,\" said Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW Motorrad, commenting on the results of this year's readers' choice.\n\nIn the \"Sports Bikes\" category, the BMW M 1000 RR continues to dominate this highly competitive and fascinating segment for the fifth year in a row. With its unique mix of sporty riding dynamics on country roads, top racetrack performance and state-of-the-art ride safety systems as well as its highly emotional design, it is once again in first place in the readers' favour for 2025. BMW Motorrad's leading position in the sports bike segment is also underpinned by the third place of the S 1000 RR.\n\nWith the uncompromisingly dynamic BMW M 1000 R powerhouse, a second M model from BMW Motorrad has once again taken the top spot. With its unrivalled chassis technology and aerodynamics, the BMW M 1000 R opens up dimensions of riding dynamics previously reserved for purebred super bikes in its segment, taking the top step of the podium in the Power Naked category. The BMW R 1250 R - with its strong character - also took third place in this category.\n\nFor the second year in a row, the powerful long-distance sports bike BMW M 1000 XR is the top M model from BMW Motorrad. With an engine output of 148 kW (201 hp), an empty weight of just 223 kg and chassis technology and aerodynamics designed for high performance on the open road, long distance touring and fast laps on the race track, the BMW M 1000 XR is the benchmark in its segment and immediately secured first place in the \"Crossover\" category as it did last year.\n\nTogether with its sister model, the R 1300 GS Adventure, the BMW R 1300 GS further cemented the cult status of the BMW boxer GS models by taking first place in the Adventure Touring category. With their new design, powerful engine, outstanding handling and convincing on-road and off-road riding characteristics, both models once again confirm the Bavarian dominance in this hotly contested segment.\n\nWith the new F 900 GS, BMW Motorrad takes the top spot in the Enduro/Supermoto category for the first time.

The American abstract painter, born in Ethiopia in 1970, first presented her artistically designed BMW M Hybrid V8 to the public at the Centre Pompidou in Paris in May 2024. After its race deployment in Le Mans a month later, this year marks the next chapter of the project in cooperation with the BMW Group: the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC).\n\nThe idea for the pan-African artist network was developed by Julie Mehretu together with her longtime friend, Mehret Mandefro, an Emmy-nominated film producer—also born in Ethiopia and living in the USA—and co-founder of the Realness Institute for the training of African filmmakers in conversation with artist Paul Pfeiffer and architectural historian Lawrence Chua. Under the guidance of a group of African and international artists, including French-Senegalese filmmaker and 2024 Berlinale winner Mati Diop, American poet Robin Coste Lewis, and Kenyan performance artist Jim Chuchu, workshops will be held in Lagos, Dakar, Tangier, Nairobi, and Cape Town for around 50 artists. AFMAC will connect with local host cultural institutions on site and workshop participants will be selected through open calls with the partners. The kickoff will take place from April 15–19 in Lagos with the cultural non-profit organization \"Angels & Muse\".\n\n“BMW is working for the first time in the 50-year history of the BMW Art Car Collection with an artist to develop the idea far beyond the car as a pure art object. This collaboration is particularly close to my heart. It expands BMW’s long-term global commitment in the film sector with an outstanding initiative that stands for exchange, creativity, and cultural diversity—values that we, as a company, also embody,” says Ilka Horstmeier, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources, and Real Estate.\n\nEach workshop results in a new film production. Once completed, the films will form an anthology of contemporary African filmmaking, which will complement exhibitions of Mehretu’s 20th BMW Art Car. In 2026, the anthology will debut in a major exhibition dedicated to AFMAC along with the 20th Art Car at Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town. The former Executive Director Koyo Kouoh (1967-2025) played a key role championing the project before her sudden and untimely death. The BMW Group has been a partner of the museum for many years, contributing its extensive network of cultural professionals and charitable institutions in Africa to establish AFMAC on a long-term and sustainable basis.\n\nInternational collaboration and access to African film historySocial engagement and engaging with peers in collectives have always shaped Mehretu's work. In 2004, she founded the artist residency Denniston Hill in North New York with Pfeiffer and Chua. Meant as a place for exchange, reflection, and retreat, artists of various disciplines and backgrounds further develop their practice there. Workshop methods conceived at Denniston Hill form the foundation for AFMAC’s workshops, where artists from various African countries and the global diaspora come together to engage with questions of cultural, political, and historical identity. The forms of experimentation that a translocal collective enables, how cultural and political heritage can be negotiated, and the role different media play in the attribution of identity forms are examined.\n\nUsing archival material of African film and media works, participants are given the opportunity to develop their own creative approaches and create new forms of media art. Accordingly, a key component of the workshops is the screening of hard-to-access African films to expand historical and cultural perspectives. The goal is to create sustainable infrastructures that last beyond the workshops and strengthen the artistic community in Africa. A central point of approach is the provision of an online film archive that African artists can continuously work with in the future.\n\nArtist talks and public presentations of AFMAC will also take place outside of Africa in 2025 and 2026. An event calendar and further detailed information, including photo and film material, are available at a digital platform documenting the project and archive for African cinema, created by New York-based creative agency Pacific.\n\nAfrican Film and Media Arts Collective – stationsApril 15–19, 2025: Lagos, Nigeria, in partnership with Angels & Muse Lead artist: Coco Fusco\n\nJuly 2025: Tangier, Morocco, in partnership with Cinematheque de TangerLead artist: Zeresenay Berhane Mehari\n\nSeptember 2025: Dakar, Senegal, in partnership with Fanta Sy and Raw Material Company Lead artist: Mati Diop\n\nOctober 2025: Nairobi, Kenya, community partner to be determined Lead artists: Jim Chuchu and Wanuri Kahiu\n\nDecember 2025: Cape Town, South Africa, in partnership with Realness Institute Lead artist: The Otolith Group\n\nBiographies of the founders and lead artists\n\nJulie Mehretu is a world-renowned American artist, born in Addis Ababa in 1970.

Standing ovations after a perfect weekend were given by over 53,000 celebrating fans at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve in Portimão (POR), when reigning world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) claimed the maximum points haul at the second round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Starting from pole position, he rode the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team #1 BMW M 1000 RR to victory in all three thrilling races. Over the weekend, he secured P1 in Superpole, Race 1, the Superpole Race, and Race 2. Additionally, he set multiple new lap records. His teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) was also among the frontrunners in Portugal, finishing the races in fifth, sixth, and seventh places. From the first free practice session onwards, he impressed with an extremely consistent and strong performance.\n\nReactions after the Portimão round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This weekend in Portimão was a milestone for BMW Motorrad Motorsport – a triumph of team spirit, technology, and unwavering dedication. With his hat-trick and new lap records, Toprak impressively demonstrated the full potential of our M 1000 RR, and Michael rounded off the strong overall performance with his consistent and very strong riding. I am incredibly proud of our entire team – both on the track and in the garage. This was more than just a victory – it was a statement. Now we turn our focus forward: Assen is waiting, and we are coming with momentum!”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “It was a very intense weekend. First of all, apologies to Toprak for having to miss the first free practice on Friday due to a technical issue, but as a team, we stayed focused, worked cleanly, and were ready with both riders from FP2 onwards. I think you could see in almost every session that both performed well. Lap records, pole position, three wins for Toprak, and Mickey consistently in the top positions – it has been a very strong weekend for BMW. It was great to be back in Europe and to see on this track layout that our 2025 bike package is working very well. That means what was discussed in the past is in the past, and we can now focus on the present. With many dry sessions both during testing and the race weekend, we had the opportunity to perfect and fine-tune the bike. The engineers, mechanics, and riders got the absolute maximum out of the bike, and the package is competitive. Now we’re looking forward to Assen.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We have been pushing really hard this weekend, in every corner. A big thank you to the team, everyone is working really hard and we improved the bike in every session. Congrats also to Nicolò Bulega, he did a great job this weekend, he is really strong. I am really happy; we were fighting with Nicolò here and I think everybody enjoyed to watch the races. I am a fighter, I love to fight and I never give up. The bike is not 100 per cent yet, but I was only pushing for the win. Yesterday’s race was harder for me because I often lost the front. I just tried to follow Nicolò and to win the race. It has been a good battle. In today’s races, the pace was incredible and I was pushing really hard, but I felt a little bit better because we had improved the bike and I felt more grip. I came here with the target to get pole and three wins. We achieved all of that and for me, it has been an incredible weekend. After Phillip Island, we came back and have been really strong here. Now we will see how the next races will be.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had a good weekend. We were pretty fast on Friday so we were really happy with how we started the weekend. In Superpole I was happy, I made some small mistakes and qualified seventh. I did not want to be there but it was not bad. In race one, I just had no feeling with the bike. I struggled a lot and it was just a long race but I finished sixth so that wasn’t too bad but I just did not enjoy it. For today, we made some changes and in the Superpole Race, I was a bit unlucky. I wasn’t precise on the first lap so I lost a couple of places. Then I fought my way back to P7 which was okay coming from where I was after lap one. In race two, I had a good start, a good rhythm. I was just not fast enough to fight for the podium but overall, it has been a good end of the weekend.”\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 26°, humidity: 37%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* new all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 25°, track temperature: 37°, humidity: 35%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 4, 1:40.351\n\nAir temperature: 21°, track temperature: 25°, humidity: 39%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:39.441 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 36°, humidity: 27%, conditions: dry, laps: 11 after red flag.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 5, 1:39.614\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R02/12, after 6 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R02/12, after 6 of 36 races)."}

Today, BMW Group Plant Regensburg commissioned a new body shop at Plant Site 6.12 (Neutraubling), attended by Regensburg’s local commissioner, Tanja Schweiger, and Neutraubling mayor, Harald Stadler. Plant Director Armin Ebner: “The BMW X1 and BMW X2 produced in Regensburg remain extremely popular with customers worldwide. In the new production hall in Neutraubling, we currently manufacture over 120 vehicle bodies per day, helping us meet high market demand.” Once completed, the bodies from Neutraubling are transported to the vehicle plant in Regensburg, where they are assembled into finished cars around the clock in three-shift operation.\n\nLocal Commissioner Tanja Schweiger: “In these increasingly challenging times, BMW continues to be a key player in the automotive industry. The decision to expand the body shop for these two best-selling models represents a clear strategy for the future and marks a significant positive development for the Regensburg district’s status as a location for industry.” Neutraubling Mayor Harald Stadler added: “The fact that you are expanding your plant here is a strong commitment to the location and shows that the economy feels at home with us. As mayor, I am also very proud when BMW vehicles with bodies 'made in Neutraubling' are on the roads all over the world.”\n\nRegensburg: the BMW Group’s highest-volume European vehicle plant\n\nEvery 57 seconds, a new vehicle rolls off the Regensburg assembly line – adding up to more than 1,400 vehicles per day. With an annual production of 342,521 cars, Plant Regensburg was the BMW Group’s highest-volume vehicle plant in Europe in 2024, exceeding its 2023 production (238,301 units) by more than 100,000 vehicles. Over a third of the vehicles manufactured in Regensburg in 2024 were electrified, either as plug-in hybrids or fully-electric models. “We build our vehicles for the global market and contribute to the growth of electromobility,” emphasised Ebner.\n\nBody shop expanded to approx. 40,000 m² – with about 150 employees\n\nAn approx. 40,000-square-metre hall on Berliner Straße was remodelled to accommodate the new body shop in Neutraubling. To the north, four smaller extensions were built, covering nearly 1,000 square metres. Around 150 employees currently work in the hall in a single shift. The production hall, which was built in 2003, is located on premises owned by the firm Preymesser. BMW previously rented this facility, using the space for logistics purposes. In April 2024, the company successfully applied for a change of use from the town of Neutraubling and the Regensburg County Administration Office. “I would like to say a big thank to the authorities for approving this request and for the excellent support from the town and County Administration Office,” underlined Ebner.\n\nImplemented in record time of less than 12 months – thanks to “tremendous team effort”\n\nThe new body shop was constructed in a record time of less than 12 months. “What we have achieved here in recent months is not only impressive because of the speed. The cooperation with all internal and external partners has been outstanding,” said Ebner, praising the “tremendous team effort of everyone involved”. Dismantling of the previous logistics facilities and construction of the new body shop went hand in hand. The first test bodies rolled off the assembly line in January and production ramped up in early March. A total of 294 robots are in use. 238 welding guns set up to 4,771 welding points per vehicle body. As part of the capacity expansion, BMW X1 bodies will no longer be produced solely in the existing body shop in Regensburg, but also in Neutraubling.\n\nPreparations for next model generation\n\nWith an investment of over 550 million euros in the past two years, the BMW Group has also secured the long-term future of both Upper Palatinate locations: Regensburg and Wackersdorf. Plant Director Armin Ebner: “This signals our firm commitment to Upper Palatinate as as location for industry.” At the same time as building current models, BMW Group Plant Regensburg is already preparing for production of the next model generation. “With the NEUE KLASSE, the company aims to set new standards for digitalisation, electrification and circularity – and we are gearing up for this in Regensburg as well,” said Ebner. During the production break over the New Year period, remodelling at the plant continued in the body shop, paint shop and vehicle assembly. Further, more extensive structural measures will follow during a five-week production downtime in summer 2025.\n\n“FACTORY OF THE YEAR” award recognises outstanding performance\n\nNumerous accolades for the plant and vehicle models built in Regensburg have confirmed the location's outstanding performance in recent years. Just a few days ago, the Plant Regensburg team was presented with the “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 award in the category “excellent large-series assembly” at a congress in Ludwigsburg. The award is regarded as one of Germany’s most prestigious industrial competitions. The judges noted that “the innovation and dynamism with which Plant Regensburg is implementing the transformation towards the iFACTORY, together with the entire workforce, is highly impressive. In particular, the flexibility in both the factory set-up and among its employees is exemplary and serves as inspiration for successful production in Germany.”\n\nMedia website: \n\nBMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf\n\nThe BMW Group vehicle plant in Regensburg has been in operation since 1986 and is one of more than 30 BMW Group production locations worldwide. Every workday, around 1,400 vehicles of the BMW X1 and BMW X2 models roll off the production line at Plant Regensburg, destined for customers around the globe. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on a single production line – ranging from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models. BMW Group Plant Regensburg was recognised as “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 in the category “excellent large-series assembly” of the prestigious industrial competition. As it implements the so-called BMW iFACTORY, the BMW Group is focused on digitalisation of the Regensburg plant site to create a digital and intelligently connected factory. It is already possible to experience in virtual form what the factory will look like a few years from now. Production of models for the NEUE KLASSE, BMW’s next generation of vehicles, will ramp up in Regensburg in the second half of the decade.The BMW Group plant in Wackersdorf is home to cockpit production and parts supply for overseas plants. With the opening of a new battery testing centre and commissioning of the first phase in autumn 2024, the location is also a key facilitator for electromobility. An entirely new area of expertise is the door and flap centre for Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe BMW Group core staff at the Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations in eastern Bavaria consists of around 9,250 employees, including about 300 apprentices."}

The artist Raphaëlle Peria and the curator Fanny Robin were named winners of the BMW ART MAKERS programme to develop their project “Traversée du fragment manquant”. This artistic project is a new experiment, the result of their collaboration, which will lead to an unprecedented exhibition. This exhibition will be presented as part of two major photography events, the Rencontres d'Arles and Paris Photo. This is part of the long-standing partnerships that BMW is developing with these two cultural platforms.\n\nThe jury was composed of Simon Baker, director of the Maison Européenne de la Photographie, Florence Bourgeois, director of Paris Photo, Andreina de Bei, journalist for Sciences et Avenir, Hervé Digne, president of Poush-Manifesto, Chantal Nedjib, founder of L'Image par l'image, Christoph Wiesner, director of Rencontres d'Arles and Maryse Bataillard, head of corporate communication and CSR BMW Group France.\n\nThe project: “Traversée du fragment manquant”For the BMW ART MAKERS programme, the artist Raphaëlle Peria and the curator Fanny Robin propose a project on the transformation of the territory.\n\nBased on a childhood trip made by the artist on the Canal du Midi, marked by the image and the presence of the plane trees that border the canal and stabilize its banks, the artist returns to this site classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site. Since 2006, the plane trees that dot the landscape have been affected by a disease caused by a microscopic fungus, causing them to wither away. Their absence will profoundly change the landscape.\n\nWith “Traversée du fragment manquant”, the artist Raphaëlle Peria, who compares her approach to that of an ecologist studying a landscape and how it works, proposes to immortalize this endangered ecosystem by mixing personal archives and current photographs of the banks of the canal. These images are printed on large-format glass plates, unprecedented in her artistic practice. Using a unique engraving and scraping process, she fuses photographs, drawings and prints to illustrate the evolution of this landscape in order to preserve its memory.\n\nRaphaëlle Peria and Fanny Robin declared upon the announcement of their nomination: “A huge thank you to the members of the BMW ART MAKERS programme jury for their confidence in our project. This programme recognizes our partnership started several years ago and will allow us to go further in the research and experimentation of new forms and new materials. This project, which we want to be unique and daring, and which will be thanks to the support and guidance of the BMW teams, is a real opportunity to explore and engage in new directions. With ‘Traversée du fragment manquant’ we invite viewers to experience a poetic escape, at the heart of the photographic image”.\n\nThe BMW ART MAKERS programme will make this project possible.“We believe that the association of an artist and a curator is key to giving birth to large-scale projects, from the first idea to the final work. We believe that dialogue and diverse perspectives are essential for creation and innovation. We give artists total creative freedom, while providing the artistic and technical expertise of our network. With the decisive support of the BMW ART MAKERS programme, this ambitious project will be able to fully materialize and shine on the national and international artistic scene” - Maryse Bataillard, Head of Corporate Communication and CSR, BMW Group France.\n\nMore than 180 applications received for this new edition.Each year, the projects received during the call for applications reflect the trends and topics invested by artists. Among more than 180 applications submitted, the six selected finalist duos had to provide a note of intent, a budget, a production schedule, a scenography proposal and images of their previous work.\n\nThese projects presented revealed a great diversity of profiles and works, with 55% of mixed-gender duos, 35% of female duos and 10% of male duos. 58% of the duos were French, 42% were international, coming from more than 26 countries.\n\nSeveral major trends have emerged, reflecting current societal challenges. Numerous proposals addressed themes related to the environment and ecological transition, inviting contemplation and meditation on the relationship between man and nature.

The abbreviation borrowed from the legendary R 80 G/S stands for 'Gelände / Straße' (Off-road / Street) and signals that the new member of the BMW R 12 family masters both equally. We know that numerous fans have been eagerly waiting for this motorcycle.\"Markus Lederer, Head of Boxer Series.\n\nThe new BMW R 12 G/S: Classic enduro design inspired by the legendary BMW R 80 G/S. Ideal ergonomics for ambitious off-road riding.\n\nBMW Motorrad and off-road sport. This motorsport success story runs like a red thread through the company's history. The high-torque boxer engine in combination with the cardan drive has proven its winning ability and durability in countless competitions.\n\nHowever, it was not until 1980 that BMW Motorrad took the concept of an enduro with a boxer engine into series production. The BMW R 80 G/S was born. A series-production off-road bike that had never been seen before. Blessed with off-road expertise, touring ability and dynamic on-road qualities in equal measure. In short: The abbreviation G/S (“Gelände / Straße” meaning off-road / street) summed up the all-round qualities of the new motorcycle perfectly.\n\nThe new BMW R 12 G/S skilfully captures the spirit of the off-road enduro with a boxer engine in the style of the R 80 G/S in terms of design and perfectly transfers it into the present day with modern technology. With long suspension travel, cross-spoke wheels, and a small, compact cockpit fairing.\n\nThree different seat options, sure-footed enduro footrests and handlebar risers for dedicated off-road adventurers.\n\nThe new BMW R 12 G/S comes with a flat solo seat as standard (standard seat height with 17\" rear wheel: 860 mm / seat height in the Enduro Package Pro with 18\" rear wheel: 875 mm).

The optional Pillion Package includes a seat for two (standard seat height with 17\" rear wheel: 860 mm / seat height in the Enduro Package Pro with 18\" rear wheel: 875 mm). The rider's seat height is increased by 20 mm with the Rallye Seat option (standard seat height with 17\" rear wheel): 880 mm / seat height in the Enduro Package Pro with 18\" rear wheel: 895 mm). The new R 12 G/S comes as standard with two practical steel eyelets on the rear frame, which can be used as lashing points.\n\nThe basic version of the new BMW R 12 G/S is equipped with a footrest system designed primarily for on-road use, but also suitable for off-road use thanks to its serrated profile. As part of the \"Enduro Package Pro\", the R 12 G/S is equipped with an enduro footrest system which, thanks to the enlarged contact area of the footrest body in combination with three rows of spikes, provides optimum grip for enduro riding.\n\nThe butted aluminum tubular handlebars allow further ergonomic adjustment. The optional Enduro Package includes a 20 mm riser.\n\nA powerful boxer engine with a superior power and torque output and a single-flow exhaust system.\n\nEver since the first BMW motorcycle - the R 32 - was launched in 1923, BMW Motorrad boxer engines have been synonymous with unmistakable, original and authentic design, a full torque curve and a unique sound character. The same is true of the new BMW R 12 G/S. The air/oil-cooled 101 mm bore, 73 mm stroke, 1,170 cc capacity boxer engine from numerous BMW motorcycle models delivers 80 kW (109 hp) at 7,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 115 Nm at 6,500 rpm. The left-hand exhaust system with high-mounted rear silencer meets the requirements of a classic enduro.\n\nStandard riding modes \"Rain\", \"Road\" and \"Enduro\" as well as additional riding mode \"Enduro Pro\" as part of the Enduro Package Pro. Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and engine drag torque (MSR) control as standard.\n\nThe new BMW R 12 G/S already features the \"Rain\", \"Road\" and \"Enduro\" riding modes as standard.

For off-road use, DTC can be switched off completely on the new BMW R 12 G/S. In addition, the 12 G/S is equipped with engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nOptional factory-installed Shift Assistant Pro for upshifting and downshifting without clutch operation for more dynamics, comfort and acceleration with almost no interruption of pulling power.\n\nThe Shift Assistant Pro, available as optional equipment ex works for the new BMW R 12 G/S, allows for clutchless shifting in almost all load and speed ranges. It offers increased dynamic performance and comfort compared to manual shifting, with extremely short shift times that enable acceleration with minimal interruption of pulling power.\n\nOne-piece tubular bridge steel spaceframe with bolted-on rear frame provides the ideal basis for an enduro. Optimised steering head section for perfect off-road ergonomics and a wide steering angle.\n\nThe one-piece tubular bridge steel spaceframe of the R 12 family is at the heart of the new BMW R 12 G/S. The rear frame, also made of tubular steel, is bolted to the main frame. The steering head is slightly higher and further forward on the new BMW R 12 G/S.\n\nLarge 21-inch front wheel as standard for optimum off-road performance. Optional Enduro Package Pro with 18-inch instead of 17-inch rear wheel for maximum off-road performance.\n\nThe new BMW R 12 G/S with its cross-spoke wheels is a fully fledged enduro. Accordingly, it is equipped with a 21-inch wheel at the front. A 17-inch wheel is fitted as standard at the rear. An 18-inch rear wheel is available as part of the Enduro Package Pro for even greater off-road capability.\n\nFully adjustable upside-down telescopic fork at the front and Paralever swingarm with angled, also fully adjustable rear shock absorber paired with long spring travel for superior off-road capability.\n\nIn addition to a stiff and stable main frame as the basis, long suspension travel is essential for ambitious off-road riding.On the new R 12 G/S, the front wheel is guided by fully adjustable upside-down telescopic fork with a 45 mm diameter and a generous 210 mm of travel.\n\nAs with the other models in the BMW R 12 family, the rear wheel is guided by a Paralever swinging arm. Suspension and damping are provided by a 200 mm travel, angled spring strut with travel-dependent damping and full adjustability.\n\nPowerful braking system in conjunction with BMW Motorrad ABS Pro for safe braking even when cornering.\n\nThe front wheel of the new R 12 G/S is fitted with a twin disc brake with two axially bolted, 2-piston floating calipers and a disc diameter of 310 mm. A single disc brake with 2-piston floating caliper and 265 mm diameter is used on the rear wheel.\n\nThe new R 12 G/S is already equipped with BMW Motorrad ABS Pro (part-integral) as standard. ABS Pro also offers more safety when braking in bends by enabling ABS-assisted braking when leaning into corners.\n\nClassically designed, centrally positioned round instrument and 12 V socket.\n\nThe new BMW R 12 G/S is equipped as standard with a centrally positioned round instrument and a 12 V socket for the on-board power supply on the right-hand side of the cockpit.\n\nPowerful LED light units as standard and Headlight Pro as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 12 G/S features a compact LED round headlight with a diameter of 5 ¾\" and an iconic light signature in the shape of an \"X\" as standard. Furthermore, the turn indicator and control lights of the new R 12 G/S also use LED technology.\n\nThe adaptive headlight, part of Headlight Pro optional equipment, offers even more safety when riding at night.\n\nThree attractive colors for the new BMW R 12 G/S.\n\nBMW R 12 G/S basic version.\n\nNight black matt paint for front wheel cover / cockpit fairing / fuel tank / airbox cover / rear end.\n\nDecals: Airbox cover.\n\nBMW R 12 G/S optional color.\n\nLight white paint for front wheel cover / cockpit fairing / fuel tank / airbox cover / rear end.\n\nDecals: Fork protectors / fuel tank / cockpit fairing / airbox cover.\n\nBMW R 12 G/S Option 719 Aragonit.\n\nSandrover matt paint / Racing red matt paint / Mineral grey metallic matt for fuel tank / front wheel cover / cockpit fairing / airbox cover / rear end.\n\nSeat: Black / Sandrover / Red.\n\nDecals: Fork protectors / fuel tank / cockpit fairing.\n\nHighlights of the new BMW R 12 G/S:\n\n• Classic, purist enduro design.\n\n• Original air/oil-cooled two-cylinder boxer engine with 80 kW (109 hp) at 7,000 rpm and 115 Nm at 6,500 rpm.\n\n• Left-hand single-flow exhaust system with high-mounted rear silencer and conical tailpipe.\n\n• One-piece tubular spaceframe with raised and forward-positioned steering head section.

The future BMW Group plant in the Hungarian city of Debrecen is on the finish straight as the ramp-up of the assembly line sees the heart of the plant come to life. This is the beating heart of all the technologies in the plant, and also where the most employees work. The assembly launch thus marks the reaching of another milestone.\n\n“Our highly efficient and ergonomic assembly line immediately started running without any issues,” said Hans-Peter Kemser, Managing Director BMW Group Plant Debrecen. “We achieved this thanks to virtual planning and tests, as well as the outstanding collaboration between our new, highly motivated employees in Debrecen and our experts within the BMW Group’s global production network.”\n\nIn assembly, the individual components and systems are installed in the painted body – at the end of the process, a car ready to drive rolls off the production line. The innovative vehicle architecture of the Neue Klasse opens totally new possibilities with regard to assembly: greater efficiency thanks to modularisation, fewer different connecting elements, and a simplified installation of the wiring harness. An innovative cockpit assembly also accelerates the process.\n\nThe BMW Group Plant Debrecen is already producing test vehicles for the first model of the Neue Klasse: the new BMW iX3.* Thus, the new plant is gradually ramping up for series production.\n\nNeue Klasse allows simple, fast assembly process\n\nA number of features of the Neue Klasse are new territory for everyone. Unlike in previous models, the cable harness is divided into multiple parts, making it easier and more ergonomic to install. The zonal wiring harness architecture requires 600 fewer metres of wiring and weighs 30 percent less than the previous generation.\n\nOn the other hand, some components are modularised when one module is formed from many small individual parts. The variation of connecting elements has also been radically reduced for the Neue Klasse. This in turn reduces the number of different plugs, screws and clips. All of this makes assembly significantly more simple.\n\nFurthermore, with the Neue Klasse, a wide range of quality checks can be performed digitally whilst still on the production line. This procedure will also be implemented at other sites after its initial use in Debrecen. The next point of use will be the home plant in Munich, which will produce the sedan model of the Neue Klasse as of 2026.\n\nThe innovative cockpit assembly accelerates processes at Plant Debrecen. It is one of the most compact in the BMW Group’s production network, yet still allows full flexibility and variety. As at Plant Lydia in China, cockpit pre-assembly is located right next to the main line. Once the cockpit has been pre-assembled, it is then installed directly in the vehicle just a few metres ahead.\n\nAssembly in Debrecen adopts innovations from existing plants\n\nWhen planning the new production site in Hungary, the BMW Group used a completely virtual design process. In line with the principles of the BMW iFACTORY, the tried-and-tested standards and high-tech solutions from existing plants were referred to many times. For example, many ideas and proven structures from Plant Lydia in China and Plant Leipzig can be found in the assembly in Debrecen.\n\nFurther development of the finger structure from Leipzig\n\nThese structures include the so-called finger structure, or comb structure, which the BMW Group developed specifically for Plant Leipzig, which opened in 2005. This structure allows supply parts and preassembled modules to be transported directly to the assembly lines. A record proportion of parts, up to 80%, can be delivered directly in Debrecen, as the fingers will enjoy logistics supply from both sides for the first time. This is the highest ratio in the BMW Group’s production network. The finger structure allows subsequent extension and the integration of further assembly steps – flexibility is a characteristic of production at the BMW Group.\n\nProduction processes, as at Plant Lydia in China\n\nPlant Lydia in China was also an inspiration for many structures and processes in the assembly. The plant opened in 2022 and was the first BMW Group site to be completely planned and simulated in the virtual world from the outset. The shop floor for the assembly line and complete conveyor system in Debrecen are set up identically. Therefore, the technology was available quickly and had already been tried and tested, simplifying the commissioning of a completely new production line.\n\nSeries production of the new BMW iX3 set to start at the BMW Group Plant Debrecen in late 2025. The Hungarian plant has been designed specifically for the production of all-electric vehicles. As with the start of any new model or new plant, production capacities are increased gradually after start of production. The plant in Debrecen will be the first automobile plant in the BMW Group to operate entirely without the use of fossil fuels during normal operation.\n\n*Since this is a pre-production model, consumption data for the new BMW iX3 is not available at this time."}

Visitors to the event venue in the historic Palazzo Borromeo d'Adda in the heart of Milan will be invited to explore thematic worlds from BMW and MINI illustrating the variety and scope of individual design.\n\nShaping the future with positivity\n\nOpenness and individualisation are the focal points of the BMW Group’s presence at this year’s Salone del Mobile. The designers are looking to the future with an optimistic eye and with an open mind to crossovers between disciplines and brands. For the first time at this prestigious event, the design team is interpreting technology and mobility solutions across different brands. The atmospheric presentation of the installation shines a spotlight on current analogue and digital design aspects of the BMW and MINI brands – first and foremost customisable driving experiences. Material and colour worlds, light and sound experiences have been created to generate the desired effect. “Our mobility design is becoming ever broader in scope,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. “Colours, materials, light, sound, geometry and digital experiences are brought together over the course of each project to create exciting and emotional customer experiences. With this in mind, our ‘Vibrant Transitions’ installation provides visitors to the Salone del Mobile with some inspirational insights.”\n\nSeeing, hearing, feeling: as they enter the Palazzo Borromeo d'Adda, visitors can decide for themselves which route they would like to follow. Colour- accentuated corridors lead to the individual thematic areas and use translucent lamella structures to create distinctive visual perspectives both outwards and inwards. “Vibrant Transitions” explores light, colour, geometry and permeability. The installation shows how the BMW Group is channelling the spirit of openness and the allure of design as it enters a new era. The creative blueprint for the installation was to make transitions something visitors could experience. This is made possible by spatial flows, the interplay of day and night, and the fusion of materiality and digitality. Its execution delves into the intriguing contrasts between the MINI and BMW brands.\n\nIndividualisation as an expression of our personalities\n\nOccupying centre stage in the installation’s three design worlds are the all-new BMW Panoramic iDrive (the revolutionary display and operating concept for the Neue Klasse), the BMW X3 “Designer's Choice” curated specially for the Salone del Mobile and the BMW CE 02 by MINI Design – a fresh and stylish, colour-rich version of the fully electric scooter. The perspectives generated through this spatial dialogue emphasise the vibrancy and positivity with which BMW Group Design is approaching the changing demands placed on future-oriented vehicle design. Everything is linked together, things can no longer be viewed separately from one another. It is about the blending of material, colour, form, digitality, sound and light. And behind it all is the newly created, cross-brand design team who have developed the creative concept in collaboration with Designworks, subsidiary of the BMW Group\n\nThe all-new BMW Panoramic iDrive represents the ideal symbiosis of technologies at the cutting edge of innovation and intuitive design. It has been designed with pixel precision to provide a holistic experience, customisable yet always with a clear BMW identity. In Milan, it is presented in an arcade created from a variety of materials, textures, light and sound accents which visitors wander through intuitively.\n\nThe BMW X3 “Designer's Choice” in the courtyard shows how individualisation through colour and material design can be used to maximise the expression of personality. Top-quality materials and appointments generate a new level of exclusivity in the interior, e.g. through the interplay of hard and soft surfaces. The exterior colour FROZEN TANZANITE BLUE lends the car an incomparable presence and brings sporting dynamism together with timeless elegance. The matte finish underscores the clear lines and contours. The dark blue shade subtly absorbs the light and creates a mysterious, luxurious look.\n\nThe MINI Neon Garden City invites visitors to linger for a while in the open air. Here, the BMW Group is showcasing its vision for urban spaces and its commitment to electric mobility – with the MINI Cooper Electric and the fully electric BMW CE 02 by MINI Design, whose colour concept was developed by the MINI Design studio specifically for the event in Milan. MINI stands out with its intelligent integration of characteristic design elements that give its\n\nvehicles their unmistakable appearance. From unique colour accents to meticulously selected textiles – every detail of a MINI is defined by a certain personality. With their well-chosen graphical design elements in green, the two exhibits celebrate city living – appropriately so, given the setting for the Salone del Mobile in Milan. Agile, compact and electric, a healthy dose of driving/riding fun is guaranteed.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n“Vibrant Transitions” in the new House of BMW will open its doors on 8 – 13 April as part of the Salone del Mobile in Milan.

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection, the BMW Art Car World Tour is taking place on all five continents with numerous accompanying activities and kicks off in Europe and Asia. The official start of the world tour was celebrated yesterday as part of the “(R) EVOLUTION OF ART” event at the BMW Group Niederlassung Wien. A total of five BMW Art Cars will be shown in Vienna at the Museum of Applied Arts and at the SPARK Art Fair from March 20-23: the cars by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Jeff Koons. The latest and 20th BMW Art Car – the BMW M Hybrid V8 by renowned American painter Julie Mehretu – will embark on an Asian tour and be displayed at Art Basel in Hong Kong on March 28-30.\n\n“We are honored to be able to host the start of the BMW Art Car World Tour in Vienna,” says Dr. Josef Reiter, Managing Director of BMW Group Niederlassung Wien. “As the BMW Group in Austria, we see it as our responsibility to promote art and culture. The (R) EVOLUTION OF ART event is part of our commitment to provide creative impulses and inspire dialogue between artists, their works of art and audiences. We believe that innovation and creativity are inextricably linked — just as in the development of our cars. Art appeals to emotions — just like a BMW. The moment in which a vehicle triggers enthusiasm, wonder or wonder is comparable to experiencing an impressive work of art. Designers and engineers are working to create not only functionality, but also an emotional bond — whether through iconic shapes, an unmistakable driving experience or the combination of technology and aesthetics,” says Reiter.\n\nDesign accelerates change: The BMW Vision Neue Klasse X and BMW Vision Neue Klasse together in Vienna for the first time.As part of the event, an insight into the Neue Klasse vision vehicles was also given. With the Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is making the mobility of the future a reality as early as this year. Vehicle dynamics, drive, battery technology, operating concept, digitization: Each of these aspects has been significantly further developed and, as with design, has sometimes skipped over a generation.\n\nWith the BMW Vision Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is giving a glimpse of what the next generation of vehicles from the core BMW brand will look like. The vision vehicle shows the BMW brand's new design language, which will be reflected in many other models from the brand. The new design language is clear, elegant and timeless. The new, all-electric vehicle architecture offers new interior design options.\n\nIn the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X, the aesthetics, technology and philosophy of the Neue Klasse are transferred to the sports activity vehicle sector. The vision vehicle offers a glimpse of the BMW iX3, which will go into series production at the Debrecen plant (Hungary) in 2025.\n\nBorn from passion: a brief history of the BMW Art Car Collection.On 14 June 1975, the BMW 3.0 CSL designed by American sculptor Alexander Calder took to the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The project was initially intended as a one-time collaboration between the artist and BMW. The audience cheered for the colourful racing car and children rejoiced. BMW decided this had to continue! It all began with the passion for art and motorsport of French auctioneer and racing driver Hervé Poulain. In 1975, Poulain found a visionary ally in Jochen Neerpasch, founder and Head of BMW Motorsport, for his plan to enter a BMW designed by an artist in the legendary Le Mans endurance race. Even though the first BMW Art Car retired from the race after seven hours, it became a true crowd favourite, laying the foundations for the collection.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement.With over 100 projects worldwide, the BMW Group's international cultural funding has been an essential part of corporate communication for almost 50 years. The BMW Group's long-term commitment focuses on contemporary art, music and film, and design.\n\nIn addition to its own formats, such as the BMW Art Cars, and the “Opera for All” concerts, the company supports leading museums and art fairs as well as orchestras and opera houses around the world. BMW Group's commitment to culture is always based on mutual curiosity and appreciation. Despite all its cultural commitments, the company takes absolute freedom of creative potential for granted — because it guarantees groundbreaking works in art just as much as it is for innovations in a commercial enterprise. The BMW Group in Austria is involved in various cultural projects in Austria and has maintained a long-standing partnership with the Albertina Art Museum. In the area of contemporary art, BMW in Austria accompanies the music festival in Steyr and the Lido Sounds in Linz."}

After the team secured BMW's 20th and most recent overall victory in the Eifel region in 2020, the 21st triumph is now the major goal. The new #BMW M4 GT3 EVO and a strong quartet of BMW M works drivers are taking on this mission.\n\nROWE Racing has been competing in #BMW M Motorsport race cars at the 24h Nürburgring since 2016 and boasts an impressive record. Besides the overall victory in 2020, the team, led by Team Principal Hans-Peter Naundorf, has finished second on the podium three times (2017, 2021, 2023). Last year, the BMW M Team RMG BMW M4 GT3 finished in third place.\n\nThis year, ROWE Racing aims for its second victory and BMW's 21st win at the endurance classic. Taking the wheel of the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO will be Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). Farfus (2010) and van der Linde (2017 and 2022) are already on the winners' list of the 24h Nürburgring, while it would be a first for Krohn and Marciello. To prepare for the highlight, ROWE Racing will compete in the first two season races of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on 22nd March and 26th April.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 EVO will also make its debut on the Nordschleife in the hands of BMW M Motorsport customer teams during the 2025 season. The BMW M2 Racing, which BMW M Motorsport will offer as a new entry-level car starting in 2026, will undergo test runs at the Nürburgring, including the 24-hour race. Additionally, many privately entered BMW race cars of various generations will excite the fans.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are highly motivated to clinch the 21st overall victory for BMW at this year's 24-hour race. Last year, we were very close, and this time we are doing everything we can to stand at the top of the podium for the first time since 2020. With a top team like ROWE Racing and four high-class works drivers, we have created the best possible conditions. The fact that the three most important 24-hour races of the year take place on three consecutive weekends is a massive logistical challenge and anything but ideal. Nevertheless, our goal is to make the most of the situation and provide a great show for our many fans at the Nordschleife. The many private BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers will also contribute to this, giving the event its unique character.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am very much looking forward to seeing the EVO versions of our BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 in action for the first time at the world's toughest endurance race. The 24 Hours of Nürburgring is an absolute highlight for customer racing at BMW M Motorsport every year. The 20 overall and countless class victories over the past 55 years speak for themselves: BMW and the Nordschleife are inseparably linked. Seeing our BMW M2 Racing, which is still in development, in race action is another highlight of what will surely be another great weekend.”\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): “Fundamentally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, our experienced team, and our strong driver line-up, we have all the prerequisites to win at the Nürburgring for the first time since 2020. That is our goal. ROWE Racing is competing for the 14th time, and our drivers, including former Nürburgring winners Augusto Farfus and Kelvin van der Linde, as well as Raffaele Marciello and Jesse Krohn, need not shy away from any other crew. At the same time, the race calendar gives us the unique opportunity to stand at the top of the podium at two 24-hour races within seven days. These are the positives, but it must also be said openly that the very unfortunate scheduling of the 24h Nürburgring presents us with unprecedented organisational challenges. It hurts us that we can only present ourselves with one car to the great fans at the Nürburgring, but given the double burden with the 24h Spa-Francorchamps, it was not possible otherwise.”"}

The two BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will sport the colours of BMW M Motorsport Premium Partners RoboMarkets and Schaeffler .\n\nBoth Rast and Wittmann remain loyal to their colours from previous seasons. Since his switch to BMW M Motorsport in the 2023 season, Rast has been starting in the blue and black of RoboMarkets. Wittmann's “Green Machine” from Schaeffler has been his trademark in the DTM since 2019. In 2024, Rast secured two victories, one second place, and one third place. Wittmann celebrated one victory and one third place.

The series is an important part of our history, and it's great to be involved again.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I am thrilled to be able to start again in the DTM with Schaeffler and the 'Green Machine' in 2025. In my second season with Schubert Motorsport, my goal is to fight for podium places and victories. If we manage to do this regularly, we can also have a say in the title race. Focusing on two cars certainly helps the team to concentrate its efforts even more. Additionally, we want to improve further compared to the past DTM season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “My goal for the upcoming DTM season is clear: I want to win my fourth drivers' title. Of course, we also want to be at the forefront in the team standings, but ultimately, winning the drivers' championship is of the highest importance – naturally for me personally, but also for the team. I haven't driven the BMW M4 GT3 EVO yet, but based on everything I've heard from my fellow drivers so far, I'm hoping for a leap forward.”"}

The anniversary weekend in #Sebring (USA), celebrating the 50th birthday of #BMW of North America, brought both highlights and setbacks for BMW M Motorsport. The 73rd edition of the famous Twelve Hours of #Sebring marked the second round of the #IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). As at the season opener in Daytona (USA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 of the BMW M Team RLL secured the pole position. In the race itself, the #24 fell far back due to an unavoidable collision. The #25 sister car finished fifth. The new BMW #M4 GT3 EVO celebrated a double podium in the GTD PRO class, with the two Paul Miller Racing cars taking second and third places. Additionally, there was a first victory for the new BMW M4 GT4 EVO in Sebring .\n\nFrom P10 on the grid, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER), and Robin Frijns (NED) in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 consistently moved forward. After a final yellow phase about 45 minutes before the end, Frijns was in sixth place and managed to gain one more position in the closing minutes.\n\nIn the pole car with number 24, Vanthoor, Philipp Eng (AUT), and Kevin Magnussen (DEN) started a comeback after a drive-through penalty and made their way back to the front of the field. However, about three hours before the end, there was a setback. The BMW M Hybrid V8 was hit on the right rear by another car after a pit stop. Magnussen initially returned to the track, but the car was so severely damaged that a lengthy repair was necessary. Only after more than an hour could the #24 crew rejoin the action and was classified twelfth in the GTP class.\n\nThe two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL have been sporting a special anniversary livery since this weekend in Sebring. Exactly 50 years ago, on 15th March 1975, BMW of North America was founded. A few days later, with the Sebring victory of the BMW 3.0 CSL, which was displayed over the weekend, came the first triumph of BMW Motorsport in North America. Jochen Neerpasch, co-founder and first CEO of BMW Motorsport GmbH, and Brian Redman (USA), Sebring winner of 1975, were also present at the anniversary weekend.\n\nGTD PRO: Paul Miller Racing celebrates a double podium.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT3 EVO added two more podium places to its already impressive success series in its debut season. The two Paul Miller Racing cars took second and third places in the GTD PRO class. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Jesse Krohn (FIN) narrowly edged out their teammates Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, and Connor De Phillippi (all USA). In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO finished sixth.\n\nFirst victory for the new BMW M4 GT4 EVO.\n\nAlready on Friday, a two-hour race of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge was on the schedule in Sebring. The new BMW M4 GT4 EVO is also in its debut season, and the BMW M Motorsport teams made a big impression with the new customer racing car in Sebring. The team from CarBahn Racing w/ Peregrine Racing achieved the first victory for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO with drivers Sean McAlister and Jeff Westphal (both USA). Dillon Machavern and Francis Selldorff (both USA) also reached the podium with Turner Motorsport, finishing third. Just behind them, the BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Auto Technic Racing, driven by Austin Krainz (USA) and Steven McAleer (GBR), finished fourth.\n\nComments after the 12h Sebring:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “The start into the Sebring weekend was very positive with the pole position by Dries Vanthoor. Unfortunately, the race itself in the GTP category was disappointing – we have to be honest. Car number 24 managed to fight back to the front after the initial penalty but was ultimately taken out of the race by an unsafe release by a competitor. After the accident, a lengthy repair was necessary, and all chances for a good result were taken away. Car number 25 also didn't have a completely error-free race. In the end, it managed to finish fifth, but that is obviously not what we had hoped for after the good performance of our BMW M Hybrid V8 in qualifying. However, we are now looking forward, as our cars were reliable and performed well. The double podium by Paul Miller Racing with the two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs in second and third places in the GTD PRO is definitely pleasing. It's a great result at the 12 Hours of Sebring, and I am very happy for the whole team and the drivers. Additionally, there was a first victory to celebrate in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge race for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. Congratulations to CarBahn Racing w/ Peregrine Racing and also to Turner Motorsport for the first podium with our new GT4.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 5th place): “It was a weekend of mixed feelings. On one hand, we were overjoyed after qualifying about the pole position for car number 24. This shows that we have a car that is extremely good in qualifying for one lap. Unfortunately, the race didn't go as well. It looked good for a while, we worked our way back to the front and were on course for a podium. But in the end, it was 'only' fifth place for car number 25. That's somewhat disappointing, as we were good in terms of speed, even though the Porsches were stronger in the end. Now, we need to make the car even faster in the race. It's a bit of a shame because we all had higher hopes after qualifying and thought we might make it to the podium. So the conclusion is that we drivers remained error-free and ended up in fifth place.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 12th place): “Our weekend started perfectly. Our car had a very good balance from the beginning, and Dries' qualifying was again great. We were also doing well in the race after a yellow phase that came at the right time. Then, unfortunately, a competitor took us out in the pit lane. That's extremely disappointing. We had a bad day today, but we also showed with both cars that we are fast and reliable. I am sure that better days will come soon.“\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 2nd place GTD PRO): “P2 for us and P3 for our sister car here in Sebring – a great result for the team. We can be delighted with the results as we also scored important points at the four and eight-hour marks for the Endurance Cup. After our bad luck in Daytona we were all a bit disappointed an knew that we need to get ourselves back up and running here. We achieved that. In the end, the winning Porsche was just a little bit too quick. Although we didn’t have a perfect race, we can be happy to spray some champagne.”\n\nNeil Verhagen (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 3rd place GTD PRO): “It's a great way to end the Sebring 12 Hours. We feel like it’s a little bit of redemption to be on the podium here now as we think we should also have been up there in Daytona. Big thanks to all the guys at Paul Miller Racing for all the hard work that gave us the opportunity to make it onto the podium. We gave it our all und just fell a little bit short. We’ll try even harder next time.”"}

Welcome to our annual conference. 2025 will be a milestone year for the BMW Group in many respects – as we set the course today for our success in the decade to come. Despite volatile global conditions, we remain firmly committed to growth in the current financial year. At the same time, we are bringing our largest future-focused project, the NEUE KLASSE, to the roads. We have a clear plan: We remain sharply focused on innovation and sustainable growth. In 2025, we expect sales figures to rise once again. At the same time capital expenditure will decrease, as planned. This will enable us to increase our free cash flow. There are four reasons for our confidence: First:Our strategy is robust and gives us a clear path forward. We are setting the pace in key areas. Our technology open approach remains successful and is gaining more traction. Policymakers and competitors are pivoting in our direction – which we continue to pursue systematically. Second:The BMW Group is one of our industry’s few true global players. Our extensive global footprint creates opportunities. It makes us resilient. And it provides the flexibility we need to respond effectively to external influences. Third:With BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, we have four strong brands. All of them are incredibly popular around the globe. Each has its own distinct identity and delivers emotionally compelling products for different target groups. And fourth:Our NEUE KLASSE: No other manufacturer has a project as ambitious and ground-breaking as ours about to enter production. I will come to this in the second part of my presentation. Let's start with the first topic: our strategic direction.Our technology-open approach is market-oriented. It allows us to fully leverage the available potential across all markets and regions. We make no distinctions – whether we are talking about combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, all-electric vehicles or, from 2028, a hydrogen-powered car. We consistently implement design principles, innovation and the latest technologies in all our vehicles. No one masters this technological diversity better than we do. Numerous national and international accolades confirm this. Our approach is also gaining increasing recognition in political circles. Even our competitors are pivoting towards our strategy. We have proven that technological openness, growth and CO₂ reduction are very much compatible. Let’s take a look at 2024: We met our adjusted targets for the year. We delivered more than 2.45 million vehicles and achieved an EBIT margin of 6.3 percent in the Automotive Segment. Our vehicles with highly efficient combustion engines remain in strong demand worldwide. At the same time, battery-electric vehicles continue to be our main growth driver. Several other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – saw a decline in sales. But we achieved growth with our all-electric vehicles. Even in challenging market conditions. In 2024, BEV sales once again climbed significantly year-on-year – increasing by more than 13 percent. Fully-electric vehicles accounted for over 17 percent of total sales last year. Including plug-in hybrids, nearly one in four vehicles sold was electrified. We are targeting further growth in e-mobility in 2025. We will hit two major milestones this year: We will reach the total of more than three million electrified vehicles and over 1.5 million BEVs sold since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8. Our customers can choose between over 15 BEVs across all our brands. One example is the new edition of the BMW iX*: The recently presented model update boasts an impressive electric range of over 700 kilometres in the WLTP cycle – with significantly more drive power. That is BMW EfficientDynamics.Our combination of electrified vehicles and highly efficient combustion engines also has a positive impact on our climate footprint. In 2024, the BMW Group once again outperformed its European CO2 fleet target – by more than 30 grammes. Based on our internal calculations, our fleet emissions fell below 100 grammes per kilometre in the WLTP cycle for the first time. We will continue to ensure that our customers always have access to the latest technology – across all drivetrains. The key to achieving this lies in our production network’s high level of flexibility. That brings me to my second point:our global footprint. The BMW Group is a true global player. Very few automotive manufacturers have such a comprehensive presence across all relevant economic regions as we do. Be it in sales, research and development, production or our supplier network. This combination gives us a strategic advantage that sets us apart from the competition in an increasingly fragmented world. We remain committed to expanding our local for local approach. We are constantly improving our access to different market regions and strengthening our resilience, especially along supply chains.One example of this is our high-voltage battery assembly plants in the three major sales regions: Europe, the Americas and China. In total, five new assembly facilities for the next generation of high-voltage batteries are being built near our production sites worldwide – complete with a local supplier network. In this way, we are already creating the necessary conditions today for successful growth in the future. We are gradually adapting our production network to rising sales of electric vehicles. Late this year, our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary will become our first facility to exclusively produce all-electric vehicles. Our main plant in Munich will follow in 2027. Our production follows the market and our product range aligns with demand. We build roughly the same number of vehicles in our three key market regions of Europe, the US and China as we sell there. This balanced distribution is another key differentiator for the BMW Group. At the same time, Germany and the US serve as key export hubs for us. In 2024, we manufactured over one million vehicles at our plants in Germany. This represents about a quarter of the country’s total car production. 56 percent of these vehicles are then exported outside the European Union.An impressive proof of the BMW Group's significant contribution to industrial value creation in Germany. In the US, one out of every two vehicles from our Plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is exported. Last year, we achieved an export value of over 10 billion US dollars. This once again makes the BMW Group the largest automotive exporter in the United States by value. We benefit from an integrated global economy. That is why we continue to advocate for open markets and free trade. Third point: the performance of our brands. The success of the BMW Group is built on the global appeal and resonance of our four brands. At the same time, we know how to fulfil the specific needs and preferences of our customers in different markets with our products. Last year, our core BMW brand leveraged its strength to the full: In three out of four regions, BMW grew sales and gained market share. This has enabled BMW to maintain its number one position in the global premium segment. BMW performed particularly well in Europe. Italy, Spain, France and the UK led the way, with all reporting double-digit growth rates.With a six-percent increase, the brand significantly outperformed the overall European market, which only grew by just over one percent. In the US market, we achieved record sales for the second consecutive year. Here, too, the strength of our market-driven approach to drivetrains is delivering results. Thanks to our steadily growing BEV portfolio, we sold more than 50,000 electric vehicles in the US for the first time. With this momentum, we are optimistic about the year ahead, as we celebrate “50 years of BMW North America”. In our markets outside the main sales regions, we also posted growth, in a declining environment overall. In this region, we lead the premium segment in total for the first time ever. The main growth drivers here included the South Korean, Australian and Indian markets. China remains a key market for the BMW Group. In 2024, we sold more than a quarter of all our vehicles there. The market is highly dynamic and characterised by increased competitive pressure. In this environment, BMW maintained nonetheless its position as the number one in its segment with a market share of three per cent. This put us within our target range. In 2024, we delivered over 100,000 BEVs to customers in China for the first time. This makes China our biggest single market for electric vehicles – even though our sales performance there was dampened last year by persistently low consumer sentiment. The high-margin vehicles built by BMW M once again played an important role in our market success in 2024. For the 13th consecutive year, M sales increased. Nearly one in ten BMWs sold carried the letter M. Demand for the sportiest BMW models has continued to grow, especially in China. 2025 is the first year with the complete New MINI Family available. And we will exploit this potential. There are a total of five unique models to choose from – three of them BEVs. The fully-electric MINI models – with the MINI Cooper Electric* leading the way – are being particularly well received. With an increase of 24 percent year-on-year, sales of MINI BEVs also saw highly dynamic growth last year. Nearly one in four MINIs is now powered by an electric heart. In the ultra-luxury segment, Rolls-Royce continues to set the benchmark. At more than 5,700 units, Rolls-Royce sales remain high.Most notably, the all-electric Spectre exceeded expectations in its first full year of sales. Every third Rolls-Royce sold is now fully-electric. BMW Motorrad also impressed in 2024, achieving a new all-time sales high of over 210,000 units. BMW Motorrad remains the undisputed number one in the global premium motorcycle segment. Ladies and Gentlemen, All of this shows that the BMW Group is well positioned across all brands, drive technologies and segments to continue on its growth path. With our global approach, we have the right answers to challenges worldwide. This has often enabled us to offset fluctuations in demand in individual markets. Now, it is time for Walter Mertl to present the Group Financial Statements for 2024 and look ahead to our goals for 2025. Part II: Ladies and Gentlemen, Growth and innovation – these are two of the main topics we will be focusing on this year. At the same time, we stand on the threshold of a new era. Late this year, we will launch our NEUE KLASSE: a project that is unprecedented in both form and significance in the history of the BMW Group. With the NEUE KLASSE, we will be turning the mobility of the future into reality. Driving dynamics, drivetrain, battery technology, operating concept, digitalisation: We have refined each of these aspects and, in the case of design, even skipped a generation. In this way, we are redefining not only the BMW brand, but also the future of individual mobility. Standing here next to me is the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X: the series version of this vehicle will kick off the NEUE KLASSE. Production will ramp up at our new plant in Debrecen late this year.After that, the rollout will continue in rapid succession, including a sporty sedan at the core of the BMW brand in 2026. We are deliberately starting out in high-volume segments: We want our innovations to have a broad impact, not just in niche segments. Between now and 2027, we will release more than 40 new or updated BMW models onto the market – from electric to plug-in hybrid to vehicles with combustion engines. Each will have the DNA of the NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE KLASSE is BMW and BMW is the NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE KLASSE is more than just a single vehicle. It marks the beginning of a completely new generation and introduces our technology boosters for the entire brand. Regardless of the drive technology, all future BMW models will benefit from the technologies of the NEUE KLASSE – and, of course, also from the new design language. Allow me to share a few examples of our groundbreaking advances in technology: With the BMW Panoramic iDrive, we are re-imagining our typical BMW driver orientation. The all new BMW Panoramic Vision is the centrepiece. This newly-developed additional Head-Up Display projects content across the full width of the windscreen. Seamless integration of various display and operating elements enables a completely new level of intuitive interaction. From the launch of the very first model of the NEUE KLASSE, all future BMW models will come with BMW Panoramic iDrive. The sixth generation of our BMW eDrive technology will make e-mobility even more appealing to our customers. The new BMW round cells promise 20 percent higher energy density, 30 percent faster charging and at least 30 percent more range. And within just 10 minutes, enough energy for another 300 kilometres can be recharged. For the first time, the Gen6 high-voltage batteries also feature the latest 800-volt technology and enable bi-directional charging. Compared to the current fifth generation, we will reduce the cost of the high voltage battery by 40-50 percent, on a comparable electric range basis. The electronics architecture has also been completely redesigned. Going forward, its four high-performance computers will control key customer functionalities. For example driving dynamics, automated driving and infotainment. These “super-brains” deliver more than 20 times the in-vehicle computing power than current systems. This makes our models future-proof for software and function updates, as well as new AI features. We have also greatly simplified the electrical system, dividing it into four zones, with intelligent control. 600 metres less wiring, a 30 percent reduction in weight and a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency are just some of the improvements we will achieve with this. And, of course, we are also harnessing technical opportunities to take driving dynamics to a whole new level. The BMW Vision Driving Experience showcases the potential of the technologies introduced in the NEUE KLASSE. We are pushing driving dynamics to its physical limits. This highly emotional driving machine will thrill more than just BMW fans. The VDX is the most powerful development prototype BMW has ever built. We are using it to test our “Heart of Joy” – one of the four super-brains in the NEUE KLASSE. We developed the software for the driving dynamics control system entirely in-house. This will be used in all future electric BMW models, setting new standards for dynamic performance and efficiency. It is hard to put into words exactly how it feels behind the wheel. You simply have to experience it. Take a look for yourselves at what our “Heart of Joy” can do, paired with a maximum torque of 18,000 Newton meters. You can't fake that kind of enthusiasm. Our Board of Management already had the chance to drive the series version of the NEUE KLASSE. Let me tell you: We were all equally excited about the driving experience – but not just in terms of pushing the physical limits. Most importantly, we were deeply impressed by the added value our technologies create for our customers in everyday situations. This is truly the next level of Sheer Driving Pleasure. Ladies and Gentlemen, We first announced the NEUE KLASSE at our Annual Conference back in 2021. Today, just four years later, we are entering the final stretch. Standing next to me is one of the prototype vehicles we have been producing in Debrecen since late last year. What is still hidden under camouflage foil here will be unveiled at the IAA MOBILITY in Munich in early September. There we will present the production model that will be available to our customers. I can already reveal one key detail to you today: this BMW will be released onto the market as the BMW iX3. This is how we continue the success story of the first all-electric BMW X model that has won over BMW fans worldwide since 2020. Testing of the BMW iX3 is in full swing. These impressions show that the next BMW iX3 is a typical X model, and a BMW through and through. As I’m sure you saw at the end of the film: The final phase of development for the sporty sedan, the second NEUE KLASSE vehicle, is also progressing rapidly.Ladies and Gentlemen, What has always set the BMW Group apart is that we keep our sights set on operational performance in the here and now. At the same time, we lay the foundation for our long-term future success. We will continue to consistently pursue our BMW path – with foresight, customer focus, self-confidence and in the knowledge of our strengths. We are ready. More than ever. Thank you.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption/emissions data: BMW iX xDrive60: WLTP combined (EnVKV): Energy consumption 21.9 kWh/100km; CO2 emissions 0 g/km; CO2 class A.

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.\n\nThe credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.\n\nReturn on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.\n\nThe BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS. However, this does not mean that topics which are assessed as “not-material” are necessarily less important.\n\nWe view sustainability holistically and as a competitive advantage. That is why we disclose our sustainability performance to our investors and customers.\n\nYou will note that the implementation of ESRS requirements have contributed over 100 additional pages to our Report. Due to the company-specific materiality assessment, comparability between companies remains limited – even within the same industry.\n\nIndeed, it can be questioned how much value the additional scope and limited comparability offer to stakeholders. Accordingly, we welcome the proposed regulatory changes in the draft of the so-called Omnibus package and look forward to the draft updates and reduced scope of the ESRS.\n\nUltimately, we want added value for our stakeholders – meaning relevant and concise information. It’s not just about reporting and compliance.\n\nSLIDE: Proposed Dividend and Payout Ratio\n\nOne important element of our stakeholder orientation is our shareholder return strategy, which the BMW Group remains committed to.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 4.30 euros per share of common stock and 4.32 euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This results in a total dividend payout of 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe proposed dividend for 2024 represents a payout ratio of 36.7%. This is within our long-term strategic target range of 30-40% and notably higher than the payout ratio in 2023.\n\nOn January 2nd, we began the final tranche of our ongoing second share buyback program, which should be completed by latest April 30th. This will conclude the second program – with 2 billion euros – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nBy this point in time, we will have reduced a total of 47 million shares in circulation since the start of the share buyback authorization in 2022. This corresponds to over 7% reduction in share capital.\n\nAt the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nYou will have noted that we have made a step change in our approach since 2021. Starting in 2022, we added share buybacks as an additional instrument alongside dividend payments. We have also increasingly used the range of dividend payout corridor. And we increased the share of Automotive free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous years’ levels to almost 100% this year.\n\nSo, let’s move to the Outlook for 2025.\n\nLooking to the market development:\n\nDue to stabilizing inflation and declining interest rates in many countries, we expect to see a rise in demand.\n\nHow will the BMW Group’s sales performance develop this year?\n\nGiven the robust economic situation, we anticipate a solid market development in the US. In Europe, we do expect growth driven by electrified vehicles. The market dynamics in China, however, will remain challenging.\n\nFor the full year, revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment are expected to be in the same range as 2024.\n\nOur guidance reflects the current status of our planning, including all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th, 2025.\n\nWhat do we expect for our key performance indicators in 2025?\n\nLet me focus on selected guidance parameters.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce vehicles.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the total impact of the tariff increases in place as of March 12th amounts to approximately 1 percentage point on the Auto EBIT margin. As a result, the EBIT margin is now expected between 5 to 7%. Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.\n\nThe Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.\n\nStarting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nWe remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.\n\nTo that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.\n\nSo, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.\n\nWith the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year."}

The BMW Group is entering the financial year 2025 with a clear commitment to growth – with a planned slight increase in sales volume, a decrease in investments and robust free cash flow.\n\n“What has always set the BMW Group apart is our ability to maintain our course, even in challenging conditions. We remain clearly focused on two things – our near term performance and our long-term perspective,” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, on Friday. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we are implementing the biggest future-focused project in the history of our company, while at the same time achieving a robust free cash flow.”\n\nAt the end of this year, the first production model of the NEUE KLASSE, the new BMW iX3, will kick off an unprecedented ramp-up of new models: Across all drivetrain variants and all segments, the BMW Group will release more than 40 new and updated vehicles onto the market by 2027. What these new models have in common is that they will be equipped with future technology clusters, which will be rolled out successively across the entire portfolio with the launch of the NEUE KLASSE.\n\n“We are taking a huge leap forward with our new technology clusters – achieving maximum scalability, increasing the level of innovation and enhancing customer benefits. We do not differentiate between segments or drivetrain technologies – we provide every customer with the latest technology,” said Zipse.\n\nConsistent implementation of strategy\n\nThe BMW Group made extensive investments in innovative technologies, its model line-up and manufacturing footprint worldwide in 2024. There will be a decrease in expenditure this year, from the planned peak in R&D spending and capital expenditure last year. On this basis, the company is aiming for a profit before taxes at the previous year’s level – despite increased tariffs.\n\n“Never before in the history of BMW have we invested so extensively in our future. Investment reached its highest level in 2024, as planned. This underlines the durability of our strategy – and how consistently we are implementing it,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management, Finance.\n\nTechnology openness as strategic success factor in global competition\n\nThe diversity of its product range remains a key success factor for the BMW Group: The company is well positioned to meet globally diverse requirements and customer needs – both today and in the future – with a broad drivetrain portfolio spanning internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive trains and, starting in 2028, also fuel-cell electric vehicles powered by hydrogen.\n\nHighly efficient internal combustion engines, which remain in high demand worldwide, will continue to play a key role. Last year alone, the company released more than 15 new or updated models with internal combustion engines onto the roads. All engines have been approved for higher percentages of renewable fuels for years. Fuels with lower CO2 content are the most effective way to reduce the carbon footprint of the existing fleet of over 250 million vehicles in Europe alone, making a valuable contribution to the transport sector’s efforts in the fight against climate change.\n\nBattery-electric vehicles (BEVs) remain the BMW Group’s main growth driver. The company’s broad all-electric offer comprises more than 15 models across all brands. This means the BMW Group has a fully-electric offer in all its main segments. In 2024, the BMW Group significantly increased its total BEV sales worldwide to 426,536 units (+13.5%), representing a sales share of more than 17%. At MINI, about one in four vehicles is fully-electric; at Rolls-Royce, it is already one in three.\n\nPlug-in hybrids (PHEVs) also remain an essential element of the BMW Group’s technology-open approach and electrification of its model range: State-of-the-art BMW PHEV models enable an all-electric range of over 100 kilometres, thus making it relevant for a large proportion of typical driving situations and also making a substantial contribution to CO2 reduction. In total, the BMW Groupdelivered nearly 600,000 electrified vehicles including plug-in hybrids (PHEVs and BEVs) to customers in 2024. This means almost one in four vehicles sold was electrified.\n\nElectrified deliveries reach new all-time high – important milestones in 2025\n\nThe company will reach two major milestones in 2025: first, three million electrified vehicles on the roads since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8 and, second, 1.5 million fully-electric vehicles delivered to customers.\n\nFirst hydrogen production vehicle to be released in 2028\n\nIn 2028, the BMW Group will become the first premium manufacturer worldwide to release a series production fuel-cell vehicle, offering its customers another emission-free drivetrain option. To this end, the BMW Group is deepening its cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation: Both partners will jointly develop the drive system for passenger cars, which will then be used in a brand-specific way in the two manufacturers’ respective models. The planned BMW vehicle will fit seamlessly into the brand’s portfolio, where it will be available alongside other drive train options.\n\nNEUE KLASSE is laying the foundation – BMW iX3 will be first production vehicle\n\nSeries production of the NEUE KLASSE will get underway in late 2025. The first production vehicle of this new generation of BMW models will have the model name BMW iX3. Series production of this SAV model, which was foreshadowed by the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X last year, will begin late this year at Plant Debrecen – the first plant in the BMW Group production network to exclusively build fully-electric vehicles. Since late 2024, the plant has been producing pre-series vehicles for testing.\n\nThe BMW iX3 kicks off an unprecedented model ramp-up up to 2027: The launches of more than 40 models of all drivetrain variants will follow in quick succession; including a sporty sedan that is core to the BMW brand, which will be launched in 2026.\n\nWith the series launch of the BMW iX3, the new technology clusters will also be integrated throughout the entire BMW product line-up based on the established modularity principle. With this development, the BMW Group has achieved a high level of innovation: Numerous patents were successfully registered – for example, for electric motor components, display projection technologies and driving dynamics control functions. This means that all future BMW models will benefit from the innovations of the NEUE KLASSE - as well as from the new design language.\n\nDigital nervous system for “Software-Defined Vehicle”\n\nFor the next stage in its customer and driving experience, the BMW Group has completely redesigned the components, functionality and connectivity its “Software-Defined Vehicle”. The result is an entirely restructured digital nervous system – consisting of a new electrical system with zonal architecture, a refined software architecture and four “super-brains”. These high-performance computers cluster the computing power for key customer functionality around infotainment, automated driving, driving dynamics and basic functions, such as vehicle access, air conditioning and comfort. In this way, the BMW Group is centralising and significantly reducing the number of electronic control units, while simultaneously providing well over 20 times more in-car computing power in the vehicle. This already ensures that the electronic control units will also be capable of accommodating future software and function updates, including AI features.\n\nThe zonal architecture comprising four zones, will substantially increase the vehicle's efficiency: On the one hand, this radically simplifies the electrical system – 600 metres less wiring also reduces weight by 30%. On the other hand, the use of “smart eFuses” allows unnecessary energy consumption to be deactivated in certain situations, such as when the vehicle is parked or charging. Developers are working on well over 1,000 software modules with more than 500 million lines of code to further enhance the software architecture of the new digital “nervous system”.\n\nOverall, the redesign of the electronics architecture enables a quantum leap in performance, integration capability and efficiency. New innovations can be relayed much faster to the vehicle through over-the-air upgrades, ensuring the car remains up-to-date – even when the next vehicle generation is already on the market. Over the course of the year, the BMW Group targets to increase the number of “over the air update” capable vehicles on the roads to over ten million.\n\nNext-level driving experience\n\nTen times faster than previous systems, developed entirely in-house and delivering maximum integration – with the “Heart of Joy” and new “BMW Dynamic Performance Control”, the BMW Group is set to achieve a quantum leap in driving experience: For the first time, the new highly integrated control unit – that will be used in every fully-electric BMW in the future – combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions. Integrated control of the drive train, braking and recuperation takes efficiency to the next level: In 98% of driving situations, the conventional brake does not need to intervene – the recuperation braking power is sufficient. As a result, the “Heart of Joy” increases overall efficiency by up to 25%.\n\nThe performance capabilities and potential of the “Heart of Joy” are showcased in the BMW Vision Driving Experience. In this new high-performance test vehicle, the functionality of the electronic control unit is tested under extreme conditions: The Vision Vehicle develops a torque of up to 18,000 Nm. The logic behind this: If the system can handle such a powerful high-performance vehicle, it will also be capable of managing the requirements of future production models. The BMW Vision Driving Experience will showcase the capabilities of the “Heart of Joy” in April at the Auto Shanghai 2025.\n\nFocus on driver orientation: The new BMW Panoramic iDrive\n\nMore than 20 years ago, the BMW Group set the benchmark for driver orientation and intuitive operability with its iDrive system. Starting in the new BMW iX3, the company is taking the next step by launching a completely new display and a new highly intelligent operating system. The clear objective is to reinterpret the brand’s hallmark “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach and develop it into the future.\n\nWith “BMW Panoramic iDrive”, the central interface for driver-vehicle interaction is being totally redesigned. At the heart of this new system is BMW Panoramic Vision – a completely newly-developed concept that projects content across the full width of the windscreen. It is rounded off by three other new components: the BMW 3D head-up display, the central display and the multifunction steering wheel. The entire system is operated either by touch or voice control via BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, which is taken to a new level through a Large Language Model (LLM).\n\nThe intelligent backbone of the new Panoramic iDrive is formed by the new BMW Operating System X, which was developed entirely in-house and is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack, delivering significant update and upgrade capabilities. The new operating system enables optimal coordination and distribution of content in the vehicle across Panoramic iDrive’s four elements. At the same time, it offers customers maximum personalisation and customisation, tailored to their individual preferences and needs.\n\nSixth-generation BMW eDrive technology\n\nThe BMW Group is launching the sixth generation of its eDrive technology in the electric models of the NEUE KLASSE. The system comprises three significantly enhanced components: the high-voltage battery, the electric motor and the “BMW Energy Master”: The latter operates as the control unit for the entire electric drive system, has been developed completely in-house and will be manufactured in the BMW Group Plant in Landshut.\n\nIn the future, the BMW Group will use round cells and an 800-volt system for its high-voltage battery. This combination heralds a major breakthrough at both cell and vehicle levels: 20% higher energy density, 30% faster charging and at least 30% more range. The round cells are integrated and wired directly into the battery housing. With this new concept, the BMW Group is aiming to reduce costs for the high voltage battery by 40 to 50 percent.**\n\nFor its e-drive, the BMW Group relies on a highly flexible and scalable modular system. The basis for this is provided by DC-excited Synchronous Motors (SSMs) that are developed and produced in-house. Vehicles with xDrive come with the option of Asynchronous Motors (ASMs) installed on the front axle, reducing energy loss by 40% and weight by 10%. In the future, customers will be able to choose between models with one, two, three or four electric motors.\n\nStrong brands, diversified product portfolio\n\nThe foundation of the BMW Group’s success lies in its fresh and attractive product line-up across all segments. In 2024, with the new BMW X3, the BMW brand unveiled the fourth generation of one of its best-selling models. Within the past two years, the BMW Group has thoroughly updated its product range in two high-volume segments: In the entry-level segment, the new generations of the BMW 1 Series and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé were released onto the market. In BMW’s core segment, both the BMW 3 Series and BMW 4 Series were further developed. Following the update to the BMW iX*, this model now provides a fully-electric range of over 700 kilometres in the WLTP cycle.\n\nIn 2024, M GmbH posted record sales for the 13th consecutive year, building on its broad and diverse model line-up, including the BMW M3 CS Touring*, BMW M5 Sedan* and BMW M5 Touring*, among others. One in ten BMW brand vehicles features M technology.\n\nWith the launch of the new MINI Convertible*, the New MINI Family is now complete, comprising five models in total.\n\nRolls-Royce recently introduced its second fully-electric vehicle, Black Badge Spectre*. The company is also investing 300 million pounds in its Goodwood production site to further expand its Bespoke and Coachbuild offerings.\n\nBMW Motorrad reported its highest-ever sales last year. This success can be attributed to its highly sought-after GS models, the new heritage models of the R12 series and the high-performance long-distance sports models from the four-cylinder series, among others.\n\nAs planned, future investments reach new all-time high in 2024\n\nSystematically and with strong momentum, the BMW Group is working on extensive future model updates and technology innovations including electrification and digitalisation across all model series. To this end, the company invested more than € 18 billion in R&D and capital expenditure linked to new products and facilities in the 2024 financial year. The company will further strengthen its global production network with the construction of the new plant in Debrecen (Hungary) – where series production of the new BMW iX3 will begin at the end of this year – along with the development of five high voltage battery assembly facilities and the extensive refurbishment of the Munich plant.\n\nBMW Group meets adjusted business targets for 2024, as forecast\n\nAs projected, the company achieved its adjusted business targets for 2024, which were set in September. The guidance adjustment was triggered by the financial effects of delivery stops and recalls in connection with the supplied Integrated Brake System (IBS) component and continuing subdued demand in the Chinese market. Outside of China, the BMW Group benefited from growing customer demand for its attractive premium vehicles: Excluding China, the BMW brand achieved growth of 4.1% for the full year and was able to expand its position as number one in the segment worldwide. The BMW Group reported revenues for the full year of € 142,380 million (2023: € 155,498 million; -8.4%).\n\nInvestment in the future reach a new high with NEUE KLASSE\n\nExpenditure for research and development increased significantly, as planned, to € 9,078 million (2023: € 7,755 million/+17.1%). The R&D ratio for the full year was 6.4% (2023: 5.0%). As planned, the BMW Group’s capital expenditure for the full year climbed to € 9,056 million (2023: € 8,836 million/+2.5%). The capex ratio for the 12-month period rose to 6.4% (2023: 5.7%). The company expects its investments in future projects to decrease, starting in 2025.\n\nGroup earnings (EBT) in line with adjusted guidance\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group reported Group earnings before tax (EBT) of €10,971 million (2023: € 17,096 million/-35.8%). The Group EBT margin came in at 7.7% (2023: 11.0%). In the fourth quarter of 2024, the BMW Group earned a margin of 5.8% (Q4/ 2023: 8.6%). Group net profit amounted to € 7,678 million (2023: € 12,165 million/-36.9%).\n\nAutomotive Segment EBIT margin at 6.3%\n\nAutomotive Segment earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 7,893 million in 2024 (2023: € 12,981 million/ -39.2%). In the second half of 2024, in particular, the operating result was impacted by the market situation in China and delivery stops linked to Integrated Braking System (IBS). The EBIT margin came in at 6.3% (2023: 9.8%), which was within the adjusted target range of 6-7%. Excluding depreciation and amortisation for BBA assets from the purchase price allocation, the EBIT margin was 7.4%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the segment earned a margin of 5.5% – excluding the BBA depreciation, EBT totalled approx. € 2.2 billion in the final quarter of the year, with an EBT margin of 6.5%.\n\nThe Automotive Segment’s free cash flow for the full year totalled € 4,852 million (2023: € 6,942 million) – despite realized future investments of € 18.2 bn. Largely due to a planned significant reduction in inventories, the BMW Group achieved a free cash flow of € 5,043 million in the fourth quarter (2023: € 1,183 million/+326%). In 2025, the segment’s free cash flow is expected to benefit from lower capital expenditure and land above €5 billion.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the BMW Group reported solid growth in the number of new contracts with retail customers for new and used vehicles in 2024, with a significantly higher financing volume per contract. The penetration rate new BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment climbed to 42.6%duringthe reporting year (2023: 38.2%/ +4.4 percentage points).\n\nEarnings before tax (EBT) for the full year 2024 amounted to € 2,538 million (2023: € 2,962 million/-14.3%). Earnings development reflected the expected lowerincome from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles year-on-year, which nevertheless remains positive on average per vehicle. Additionally, earnings were impacted by higher provisions for credit and residual value risks, and additional allocations to provisions.\n\nHigher payout ratio – dividend of € 4.30 proposed\n\nAccounting for the payout ratio target range of 30 40% of net profit attributable to the shareholders of BMW AG and subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025, thecompany’s unappropriated profit (according to the German Commercial Code) of € 2,677 million (2023: € 3,802 million/-29.6%) will be distributed to shareholders from BMW AG’s net profit. This represents the highest ever payout ratio of 36.7% (2023: 33.7%). Accordingly, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of € 4.30 per share of common stock (2023: € 6.00) and € 4.32 per share of preferred stock (2023: € 6.02). This makes the dividend for fiscal year 2024 the fourth highest in the company’s history.\n\nIn addition, share buybacks remain a solid pillar of the shareholder return strategy. Since authorization by the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the BMW Group has acquired a total of 6.35% of the share capital as of December 31, 2024. By April 2025, the company will have purchased a total of 4 billion euros in shares. At the Annual General Meeting on May 14, BMW AG will request a further authorization to buy back additional shares amounting to 10 percent of the existing share capital within the next five years.\n\n“The BMW Group has consistently implemented its shareholder return strategy, even in the challenging financial year 2024. The highest payout ratio ever agreed in the history of BMW AG results in a dividend of €4.30 . In addition to our reliable annual dividends, our shareholders benefit from our share buyback programmes. Of course, our employees also benefit from the company’s success: They participate in it through our profit-sharing scheme and discounted share purchase options,” said CFO Mertl.\n\nNumber of employees higher year-on-year\n\nThe BMW Group employed 159,104 employees at the end of 2024 (2023: 154,950/ +2.7%). This slight increase in employee numbers was, as planned, due to the ramp-up of the NEUE KLASSE, primarily in development, IT and the BMW Group’s global production network.\n\nDetailed guidance for financial year 2025\n\nThe BMW Group anticipates the following developments during financial year 2025: Inflation continues to stabilize and further moderate interest rate cuts in many countries suggest that demand will rise slightly in 2025. With the full availability of new models — the BMW 5 Series, the BMW X3 and the renewed MINI model range, as well as the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé — the company expects slight growth in sales overall. The share of all-electric vehicles in deliveries will increase slightly compared to 2024.\n\nThe electrification and digitization strategy will continue in 2025; however, costs and investments are expected to decline after the 2024 peak. At the same time, the continued challenging situation in China, tariff increases and ongoing support measures for the supply chain are expected to provide headwinds.\n\nThis guidance takes into account the effects of the tariff increases that came into force up to March 12. In view of the aforementioned aspects, Group earnings before taxes will beexpected on previous year’s level***. An EBIT margin in the range of 5.0 to 7.0% is expectedin the Automotive segment.

For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nGLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nA new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nThe payout ratio is preliminary. Although the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a fixed dividend per share at the Annual General Meeting, the number of shares entitled to a dividend is expected to fall by the Annual General Meeting due to the ongoing share buy-back programme. Accordingly, the total amount to be distributed to shareholders by 14 May is also still expected to change.\n\nProfit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.\n\nProfit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\nPlug-in-hybrid electric vehicle - hybrid vehicle with petrol engine and electric drive.\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Finance Communications\n\nSebastian Kessler, Communications Corporate, Strategy\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe economic success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. Sustainability is a key element of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy and covers all products from the supply chain and production to the end of their useful life.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Fuel consumption/emissions data: BMW iX xDrive60: WLTP combined (EnVKV): Energy consumption 21.9 kWh/100km; CO2 emissions 0 g/km; CO2 class A.

Calder, Lichtenstein, Warhol, Holzer, Hockney, Koons, Rauschenberg, Mahlangu, Eliasson, Baldessari, Cao Fei, Mehretu. For the past 50 years, the #BMW Art Car series has provided artists fascinated by automobiles with a perfect playground for art and design, technology and innovation, motorsport and engineering. The collection of 20 BMW Art Cars embodies the essence of global cultural engagement with over one hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music and film, as well as design. The \"rolling sculptures\" – from Alexander Calder’s first-ever Art Car to Julie Mehretu’s latest – offer a cross-section of art history over the past five decades: minimalism, pop art, magical realism, abstraction, conceptual art and digital art are all represented.\n\n“I love that car. It has turned out better than the artwork.”Andy Warhol, BMW Art Car #4, 1979\n\nThe artists are selected by international juries of museum directors. In close collaboration with the BMW Group’s engineering and design teams, they freely develop their concepts and inspire everyone involved. To mark the 50th anniversary, the BMW Art Car World Tour features an exhibition programme spanning all five continents and including numerous accompanying events.\n\n“The car should not only race in a physical way but also in the heart.”Cao Fei, BMW Art Car #18, 2016\n\nAn anniversary around the world.\n\n\"The BMW Art Car Collection celebrates 50 years of artistic freedom and visionary design. The 20 vehicles have become international icons, telling stories of society, technology and performance. Our commitment to art and culture is long-term. We are continuously developing the collection and bringing art and automotive culture together in a unique way,\" says Ilka Horstmeier, Board Member for Human Resources and Real Estate at BMW Group.\n\nThe BMW #Art Car World Tour kicks off in Europe and Asia. On 20-21 March, the BMW Art Cars created by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Jeff Koons will be on display at the Museum of Applied Arts and the SPARK Art Fair in Vienna for the BMW Group Niederlassung Wien event “(R)Evolution of Art”. The latest and 20th BMW Art Car – the BMW M Hybrid V8 by renowned American painter Julie Mehretu – will embark on an Asian tour and be displayed at Art Basel in Hong Kong on 28-30 March.\n\nMehretu is developing her Art Car project far beyond the vehicle as an object and will host workshops for young film and media artists across five African countries in 2025, together with film producer Mehret Mandefro and the BMW Group. The results of the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC) will be presented in 2026 alongside Mehretu's Art Car in an exhibition at the Zeitz MOCAA in Cape Town, curated by its Executive Director, Koyo Kouoh, the designated curator of the #Venice Biennale 2026.\n\n“The whole BMW Art Car project is about invention, about imagination, about pushing limits of what can be possible.” Julie Mehretu, BMW Art Car #20, 2024\n\nImportant museums and platforms for classic automobiles are also celebrating the milestone anniversary of the BMW Art Cars. The 13th Art Car by Sandro Chia will be showcased at the classic car festival Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este at Lake Como in May. In July and August, the Louwman Museum in The Hague will present eight BMW Art Cars in a special exhibition.\n\n“I also thought it would be nice if women could participate other than standing around in bikinis.”Jenny Holzer, BMW Art Car #15, 1999\n\nThe #BMW Museum, the home of the BMW Art Cars when they are not travelling the world, is also honouring the collection by combining two anniversaries in a special exhibition. The BMW 3 Series is also celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2025, and starting 16 June, the museum will showcase a historical overview of all BMW 3 Series models as well as the BMW M3 Art Cars by Sandro Chia, Michael Jagamara Nelson, and Ken Done.\n\n“I think mobile museums would be a good idea. This car is the fulfilment of my dream. I would like to do ten more.”Robert Rauschenberg, BMW Art Car #6, 1986\n\nNew Art Car book, new Art Car model, new Art Car fashion collection.\n\nIn addition to the exhibition programme, BMW is releasing various new art and lifestyle products in celebration of the anniversary. The 1:18-scale miniature of the 20th Art Car by Julie Mehretu is available for purchase across BMW Lifestyle Shops, with a 1:43 version to follow later in the year. Together with publisher Hatje Cantz, BMW is presenting the third edition of the \"BMW Art Cars\" catalogue. Interviews with the founders of the collection and essays on each of the 20 Art Cars highlight the art historical relevance and diversity of the works. The cover design of the new edition is by Julie Mehretu. Following the popular Alexander Calder and Roy Lichtenstein fashion collections, the third collaboration with Puma based on the BMW Art Cars will be announced later this year.\n\n“So you can say, the BMW Art Car is definitely a typical Baldessari and the fastest artwork I ever created!”John Baldessari, BMW Art Car #19, 2016\n\nBorn from passion: a brief history of the BMW Art Car Collection.\n\nOn 14 June 1975, the BMW 3.0 CSL designed by American sculptor Alexander Calder took to the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The project was initially intended as a one-time collaboration between the artist and BMW. The audience cheered for the colourful racing car and children rejoiced. BMW decided this had to continue! It all began with the passion for art and motorsport of French auctioneer and racing driver Hervé Poulain. In 1975, Poulain found a visionary ally in Jochen Neerpasch, founder and Head of BMW Motorsport, for his plan to enter a BMW designed by an artist in the legendary Le Mans endurance race. Even though the first BMW Art Car retired from the race after seven hours, it became a true crowd favourite, laying the foundations for the collection.\n\n“Hervé, win! But drive carefully!” Alexander Calder, BMW Art Car #1, 1975\n\nIn close collaboration with legendary New York gallerist Leo Castelli, BMW Art Cars by American artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol followed – and all were raced by Hervé Poulain and the BMW team at Le Mans. From 1982 to 1992, the BMW Art Car Collection opened up to the world, with artists transforming various standard production models: Ernst Fuchs, Robert Rauschenberg, Michael Jagamara Nelson, Ken Done, Matazo Kayama, César Manrique, A. R. Penck, Esther Mahlangu, Sandro Chia and David Hockney. In 1999, BMW returned to motorsport with the BMW V12 LMR prototype and American conceptual artist Jenny Holzer. Eight years later, Olafur Eliasson designed \"Your mobile expectations: BMW H₂R Project\" based on a record-breaking hydrogen race car. Jeff Koons, John Baldessari, Cao Fei, and Julie Mehretu have added dynamic race cars over the past 15 years. Since its invention nearly 140 years ago, artists worldwide have engaged with the automobile both critically and enthusiastically. And over the last 50 years, the BMW Art Car series has contributed significantly to this inspiring dialogue.\n\n“These race cars are like life, they are bursting with power and have enormous energy.

The 73rd edition of the Twelve Hours of Sebring (USA) this coming Saturday, 15th March, is all about a significant anniversary. BMW North America celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, and the endurance classic in Florida plays a special role in this history. The story of BMW North America began in 1975 with the victory of the BMW 3.0 CSL at Sebring. Accordingly, the two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL will compete from this season’s second race of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) with a special anniversary livery.\n\n1975 was a historic year for BMW in North America. BMW North America was founded on 15th March, and just days later, the BMW 3.0 CSL secured the brand’s first major sports car victory in the USA at Sebring. This triumph came in the very first race that BMW Motorsport GmbH and the newly established BMW North America entered together. Exactly 50 years later, the BMW M Hybrid V8 livery at the Twelve Hours of Sebring pays tribute to half a century of motorsport success in North America. It showcases key milestones from 1975 to today, embedded within the track silhouette of Sebring. As witnesses of history, Jochen Neerpasch, co-founder and first managing director of BMW Motorsport GmbH, and Brian Redman (USA), Sebring winner of 1975, will be present for the anniversary. The BMW M Hybrid V8s will continue to feature these special liveries throughout the IWSC season.\n\nThe Twelve Hours of Sebring marks the second event of the 2025 IWSC season. At the endurance classic in Florida, BMW M Motorsport teams aim to extend the 50-year legacy of success. BMW M Team RLL fought for an overall podium finish with its two BMW M Hybrid V8s in the GTP class at the season opener at Daytona (USA) in January. In the GTD-PRO class, Paul Miller Racing, with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs, is among the favorites, while Turner Motorsport is targeting victory in the GTD class with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nThe 12-hour race at Sebring starts on Saturday, 15th March, at 10:10 local time (15:10 PM CET) and can be watched live at \n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “Sebring and BMW M Motorsport share a very special bond. This track has played an outstanding role in our history in North America, which now spans half a century. We are excited for the anniversary weekend, and our goal is to add new milestones to those already displayed on the liveries of our BMW M Hybrid V8s. We have already shown at Daytona and at the FIA WEC season opener in Qatar that we have made another significant step forward with our LMDh car. This gives us confidence for a strong performance in the GTP class. Our new BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also immediately demonstrated its winning potential.

The BMW Group is the first automotive manufacturer to launch a completely newly developed digital nervous system for all drivetrain variants and vehicle segments. It is more intelligent, more powerful and more efficient and will be rolled out for the first time in the models of the #Neue Klasse. Four high-performance computers, also called \"Superbrains\", consolidate the computing power for the most important customer functions: infotainment, automated driving, driving dynamics, and basic functions such as vehicle access, climate control, and comfort. The four #Superbrains provide more than 20 times the computing power compared to the current vehicle generation and are already designed for upcoming software and function updates, including AI-powered customer experiences.\n\n\"Technology openness is the key to BMW's success. Starting with the first model of the Neue Klasse, we will roll out the technologies of the Neue Klasse across the entire future model portfolio – across all segments and all drivetrains. This also applies to our completely newly developed electronic architecture made up of powerful 'Superbrains' and highly interconnected software platforms. This architecture allows us to decouple the development of the vehicle and software from each other. The advantage: More than ever before, all future BMW models will remain digitally up to date via over-the-air upgrades and will receive updates even from the next and subsequent vehicle generations,\" says Frank Weber, Board Member for Development at BMW AG.\n\nA fundamental component of the digital nervous system is the radically simplified wiring harness. It is based on a so-called zonal wiring harness architecture, which uses 600 meters less wiring and brings 30% weight savings compared to the previous generation. The wiring harness is divided into four zones: front end, center, rear and roof. The Superbrains are connected via high-speed data connections to smaller control units, the zonal controllers, which manage and consolidate the data flow of the electronics in and out of the zones. The wiring in the vehicle is therefore zone-related and can thus be shorter, thinner, and lighter.\n\nA crucial prerequisite for thinner and lighter wiring are the so-called \"Smart eFuses\". These are digital fuses that replace up to 150 traditional fuses. #Smart eFuses can be intelligently programmed for digitally controlled energy distribution to components. The selective activation of components allows for the design of intelligent power modes for various vehicle states such as driving, parking, charging, and upgrading, in which unnecessary consumers can be identified and switched off. Thus, the eFuses make a significant contribution to the 20% improved energy efficiency.\n\nThe completely newly developed electronic architecture forms the basis for the next generation SDV. From the launch of the Neue Klasse, the upcoming BMW model generation will benefit from it. The first fully electric derivative of the Neue Klasse will go into series production later this year at the Debrecen plant (Hungary).\n\nThe advanced software architecture of the BMW Group builds on this new electronic architecture. With the multitude of digital functions in SDVs, it is crucial that functions can be continuously developed on stable software platforms rather than being newly developed for every new generation. This is precisely what is achieved with the Neue Klasse. In the vehicle the software platforms run on the respective Superbrains, and the vehicle functions run on top of them. The \"Shared Service Layer\" acts as a connecting element (middleware) and provides, among other things, state-of-the-art cybersecurity and flexible over-the-air updates. It also enables customer-relevant AI functions thanks to intelligent networking of cross-domain data sources.\n\n\"With the introduction of the Neue Klasse, we are entering a mode of software development where we achieve software continuity. This means we continuously develop software rather than starting from scratch each time,\" says Christoph Grote, Senior Vice President BMW Group Electronics and Software. \"Based on our advanced software architecture and the fact that today our global development teams generate 130 times more software than ten years ago, we see ourselves in an excellent competitive position. More than ever, our software developers can focus on product innovations.\"\n\nFor the Neue Klasse, the development teams are working on well over 1,000 software modules, around 40 GB of software, and over 500 million lines of code, which will ultimately be integrated into the Superbrains and the rest of the electronic architecture in the vehicle. To achieve this, the BMW Group has established a solid foundation for future-proof and highly effective vehicle software development in recent years. Innovative methods and tools have been anchored in the continuously growing global developer network. At the heart of vehicle software development is the integrated developer environment: a tailored tool-chain called \"CodeCraft.\" The speed and quality of development have been enhanced with the use of a variety of tools that support the software developer with generative AI. CodeCraft runs in the cloud on up to 75,000 virtual CPUs, supports the simultaneous work of well over 10,000 software developers, and records up to 200,000 software builds per day at peak times. This corresponds to a productivity increase of more than 130 times compared to ten years ago."}

The aim of the Euro NCAP tests is to continuously increase vehicle safety. Both vehicle occupants and other road users should be exposed to an ever-decreasing risk of injury. The long-term intention: \"Vision Zero\" - that is, zero road fatalities in Europe. Accordingly, the requirements in the tests become stricter year after year. The criteria for the protection of pedestrians and cyclists have been tightened, and the test scenarios for both passive and active safety have been expanded.\n\nA top rating of 5 stars is not common in the segment of fully electric MINI Cooper models. Particularly new vehicles in this category often come up short due to price sensitivity - accordingly, the top rating is awarded rather rarely.\n\nThe Euro NCAP (European New Car Assessment Programme) ratings are a Europe-wide recognised standard for accident safety and are constantly being adapted. They provide a quickly comprehensible comparison of the safety features of a new vehicle. The award of the top rating of 5 stars is exclusively given to new vehicles that provide excellent impact protection and, in addition, a good range of comprehensive and practical technology for accident avoidance.\n\nExcellent: Top rating from Euro NCAP for the electric MINI Cooper models. The electrically powered MINI Cooper models impress with their performance, the comfortable spaciousness despite compact dimensions, and the new minimalist design. Thanks to the fully electric drivetrain, the legendary go-kart feeling, and the now certified high level of safety, the fifth generation of the charismatic three-door model is perfectly equipped for the demands of today's urban mobility. The combination of sheer driving fun and a high level of safety underscores the exceptional position of the MINI Cooper Electric models in their segment and at the same time the premium claim of the brand.\n\nIn addition to passive and active safety, the top rating in the current Euro NCAP test is also due to effective protection for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as effective systems for accident avoidance. New is the standard pelvic belt pretensioner in all fully electric MINI Cooper models, too.\n\nIn the four major safety areas, the MINI models achieve top values for their segment. In terms of occupant protection, the three-door model achieves a safety compliance rate of 89% - a value that is usually reserved for larger vehicle classes.\n\nThis also applies to the 87% in child safety and the 79% in safety assistants. With 77% in pedestrian protection a very high level of safety I also achieved for compact cars.\n\nThe extensive standard equipment with safety-relevant driver assistance systems also plays a decisive role in the top ratings. The passive safety has been further developed in the form of an integrated safety concept.\n\nAs early as December 2024, the new MINI Countryman achieved the top rating of 5 stars, underscoring the brand's claim not only to produce extremely attractive, but also particularly safe vehicles.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper E (WLTP combined: Power consumption 14,3-13,8 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions 0 g/km; CO2 class A).

The history of the BMW Golf Cup stretches back over three decades. During this time, Thailand has hosted the World Final on multiple occasions. Despite this, all of this year’s participants can look forward to something new. For the first time, the highlight of the world’s largest tournament series for amateur golfers will take place in Thailand’s inspiring capital city, Bangkok. However, one thing remains the same at the new venue; World Final will be an unforgettable week of golf, full of joy, intercultural encounters and unique experiences that will be remembered forever.\n\nThe World Final opened with the traditional parading of the flags of the 38 countries and regions represented. The amateur golfers qualified for the World Final through roughly 1,000 tournaments around the world. Over the coming days, they will discover a spectacular setup for the sporting element of this prestigious event: Alpine Golf Club. The 18 lovingly maintained holes feature lightning quick greens, undulating fairways, and a design by Ron Garl that is as demanding as it is spectacular. It is no coincidence that this golf course is regarded as the best that Bangkok has to offer. The World Final is held in three categories, each played over three rounds: Men’s A (up to HCP 12), Men’s B (HCP 13-28) and Ladies (HCP up to 28). As well as the titles being up for grabs in these individual categories, there is also a Nations competition (36 teams).\n\nThrough their sporting efforts, the participants can also do their bit for charity over the course of the three rounds. As it did last year, the BMW Group’s “Eagles for Education” initiative is again helping the UN agency for children, UNICEF*, to give young people the skills and knowledge needed to be successful in the working world of tomorrow, and to lead a self-determined life.

At the season-opener of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) in Qatar, the BMW M Hybrid V8 and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO delivered strong performances, making a significant impact in the competition against the world's top manufacturers. The two BMW M Team WRT hypercars finished in fourth and seventh places respectively, earning valuable points for the World Championship standings. In the LMGT3 class, the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved a podium finish, coming in third .\n\nAt the start of its second season in the FIA WEC, the BMW M Hybrid V8 demonstrated strong pace. In qualifying, Dries Vanthoor (BEL) secured a spot on the front row with a second-place finish in 1:38.495 minutes – a first for the hypercar, missing pole position by just 0.136 seconds. Robin Frijns (NED) also made it into the top-ten Hyperpole with the sister car.\n\nDuring the race, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 initially fell back, but the team, including Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen (DEN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI), fought their way back to the top positions with strong lap times over the ten-hour race. In the end, only the three Ferraris, which battled among themselves for the win, were faster. The #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Frijns, René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), was at one point in third place but finished seventh due to varying strategies.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, a BMW M Motorsport crew celebrated a podium finish. Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS) drove the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO to third place, mounting a remarkable comeback from 14th on the grid after a setback in qualifying. The #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, piloted by Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), faced challenges and finished eleventh in the LMGT3 class.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “This was a very good start to our second season in the FIA WEC. Our two BMW M Hybrid V8s showed strong pace from the Prologue, and with a second place in qualifying, we underscored our ambition to compete for the podium. Unfortunately, the Ferraris were a bit too strong in the race, but we are satisfied with fourth and seventh places. We are happy about the important points for the World Championship standings and the continuation of our positive trend from the end of the 2024 season and the Daytona IWSC opener a few weeks ago. We can definitely build on this performance. Congratulations to Augusto Farfus, Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin for their podium in the LMGT3 class. Our new BMW M4 GT3 EVO has once again proved that it can be a guarantee for success. Thanks to everyone who worked hard over the winter to get us into this good starting position for the season.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “Looking at where we were in Qatar a year ago, we have improved significantly. Not making it to the podium with our hypercar is tough, but the Ferraris were hard to beat. The guys did an incredible job, and we are happy to take the result home. Of course, we want more, but we collected important points here. In the LMGT3 category, we had a challenging weekend and not the fastest car. Still, making it to the podium with the #31 is very positive. The #46 seemed to lose some pace during the race. We need to analyse the reasons for that.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 4th place): “After starting second, fourth place might not be the result we hoped for, but we didn't have a flawless race – including from my side. Without these mistakes, we could probably have fought for third place, even though there was no way past the Ferraris this weekend. They were incredibly fast in every session, making it very difficult to beat them. That was clear from the start. I think we can be satisfied. I believe we can be proud of the progress we've made compared to last year. However, we are not there yet. It's clear that we are not the fastest yet – so we need to keep working hard.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 7th place): “That wasn't bad. We can really be satisfied with the progress we've made in a year. Looking at where we were last year – both cars outside the top-ten – we've made a huge step forward. I think we can really be proud of BMW M Motorsport for giving us a car that we can really race with. The drivability has improved tremendously, and that now allows us to compete with other cars. As a driver, that's a great feeling because you feel that you're also doing a better job.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd place LMGT3 class): “Considering where we started and where we finished the race – nobody would have predicted this. It shows what a great team we have behind us and what a strong driver lineup, as we executed it perfectly. Taking a podium home feels like a win. After qualifying, we wouldn't have expected this result. Third place gives us great hope that we can maintain the momentum.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 11th place LMGT3 class): “It's frustrating that we finished the race outside the top-ten. We have so much potential within the team and our driver line-up. For some reason, we didn't have the same pace as our sister car. The team will investigate this. We also need to put the penalties behind us. We need to deal with it, shake off the result, and look forward.”"}

Former world number one Luke Donald will compete for the third consecutive time and the seventh time overall at the BMW International Open. Donald is the first European since the Scotsman Bernard Gallacher (1991, 1993, 1995) to serve as captain in consecutive Ryder Cups. He will attempt to defend the title won two years ago in Rome at the 45th Ryder Cup with Worldwide Partner BMW (September 23-28, 2025, Bethpage Black Course, USA). In an interview, the 47-year-old Englishman discusses the upcoming BMW International Open, the special challenges of a Ryder Cup in the USA, and talks about the value of support from BMW.\n\nLuke, you made your debut at the BMW International Open in 2004, came back to Munich many times and will be teeing off for the third time in row this year. From a player’s perspective, why is the tournament a special event?\n\nLuke Donald: “The BMW International Open is a great event and one that all the players on the DP World Tour look forward to. We are treated so well by BMW, from the courtesy car service to the players’ lounge, with every little detail being thoroughly thought through.”\n\nIn general, do you enjoy coming to Munich and the welcome from German golf fans? What kind of audience are they? Are the German fans different to other stops on the tour?\n\nLuke Donald: “I really enjoy coming to Munich. It’s a vibrant city with plenty of culture and things to do, which makes for an enjoyable week off the golf course as well as on it. German golf fans really do know about the game – and given some of the players the country has produced over the years it’s no wonder. They’re knowledgeable, respectful and show their appreciation when they are entertained. The vibe around the golf course is always one of real class.”\n\nObviously some of your greatest achievements as a player came at the BMW PGA Championship in Wentworth, which BMW has partnered since 2005. Can you describe what the company has done for the game of golf, especially in Europe, over the decades?\n\nLuke Donald: “BMW has been a valued partner of the DP World Tour and the Ryder Cup for a number of years and there is no doubt that the game of golf has benefitted enormously from its involvement. Both the BMW International Open and the BMW PGA Championship are events of the very highest calibre and BMW can take a large amount of credit for that.”\n\nBMW is also a long term and dedicated partner of the Ryder Cup. What does this support mean to Team Europe and the campaign?\n\nLuke Donald: “BMW’s support of the Ryder Cup is huge to everybody involved. We want to bring the excitement of golf’s greatest team contest to as many people as possible and BMW helps to do that through innovation and initiative. In 2023, we were proud to partner with BMW as they – as a world’s first – launched the ability for BMW owners around the world to broadcast the 44th Ryder Cup live in 7 Series vehicles and many more models.”\n\nSpeaking about the Ryder Cup and the BMW International Open in July, at which stage will Europe’s campaign be at this time? What will be the focus of your attention in Munich as a captain?\n\nLuke Donald: “We have our processes in place and the closer we get to Bethpage, the more we will delve into some of the detail to give us the best chance of being triumphant in New York. We’ll continue to keep an eye on certain players, try to spend some time with them and work towards creating another great Team Europe environment.”\n\nAfter leading the team to a great win in Rome, you now face the challenge of a Ryder Cup away match. Does this change your approach and how do you respond to the challenge?\n\nLuke Donald: “There is no question that being a captain away from home is a tough task, but I have never shied away from challenges throughout my career and it is precisely the kind of thing that motivates me. Every Ryder Cup demands a unique approach and this year’s will be no different, but we will do everything we can to ensure our team of 12 is given the best possible chance of success.”\n\nSome things will still feel like at home, like the BMW courtesy car service. Can you enjoy a relaxing ride to and from the course, given the pressure during that week and the many thoughts that cross your mind?\n\nLuke Donald: “The BMW courtesy car service really is second-to-none and having the reliability of BMW gives us all one less thing to worry about during an intense week.”\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring: electric power consumption combined: 20.9 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2 classes: A"}

On 1 March 2005 BMW Group Plant Leipzig went on stream – with series production of the fifth-generation BMW 3 Series Sedan. Its construction had been announced four years earlier, in July 2001, with the location chosen from among more than 250 applicants. Since then, some 3.75 million cars have rolled off the production lines, and the plant has been steadily extended and upgraded. The BMW Group has so far invested more than 5 billion euros in the site – and will continue to capitalise on its flexibility in the future.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig currently manufactures four models with three different types of drive by two different brands – all on the same production line: the BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer (including the plug-in hybrid version) and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé as well as the MINI Countryman in both its fully electric and conventionally powered variants. When the plant was in planning, output was expected to total 650 units a day. Now, 20 years down the line, capacity stands at up to 1,300 units a day. Since 2005 there have been 20 different product launches of BMWs and MINIs Made in Leipzig.\n\nExtraordinary architecture and flexible structures\n\nIn its 20 years of existence, BMW Group Plant Leipzig has set standards time and again and clocked up a succession of milestones. The architecture of the central building alone remains impressive to this day. Designed by the renowned Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, it was awarded the German Architecture Prize in 2005, the year it opened. As the centrepiece and linking element of the plant, it provides the backdrop to the spectacular procession of vehicles that pass overhead through the offices on their way through the production process.\n\nThe flexible structures of the plant halls have also proven their worth to this day, throughout the various expansion stages of the facility. Leipzig was the first assembly plant in the world to feature a ‘finger’ arrangement in the production hall, for example, which offers ideal logistics solutions and can be flexibly adapted as needed. Developed specifically for this site, the finger layout allows trucks to deliver parts and preassembliesstraight to the production line. It also means extensions can be added as needed and new assembly stations integrated easily without having to rebuild the line from scratch. At the moment various further extensions are being added on the 240-hectare site.\n\nFor the last 20 years, BMW Group Plant Leipzig has demonstrated tremendous flexibility and adaptability, accommodating new products, processes and technologies. It has often played a pioneering role within the BMW Group production network. Its first upgrade consisted of the addition of a new press shop. This went into operation in 2009 and incorporated the first high-speed servo press in the world, able to produce pressed parts with unprecedented speed and efficiency. By 2014 three additional large-scale presses and two coil systems for body panels had also been installed, completing the press shop upgrade.\n\nPioneer in electromobility\n\nOne particularly defining moment for Plant Leipzig was the decision to produce its first fully electric vehicle there, making it the birthplace of electromobility at the BMW Group. Between 2013 and 2022 more than 250,000 all-electric BMW i3 vehicles rolled off the production lines. Their carbon bodies were a world first in series production. In 2014 the BMW i8 followed: the first plug-in hybrid by the BMW Group, it featured an award-winning, futuristic design and progressive technologies, which together made it an icon among sportscars. With 20,500 units made – including the BMW i8 roadster launched in 2018 – the era drew to a close in 2020.\n\nBut the team’s expertise in electromobility continues: in 2021 BMW Group Plant Leipzig launched e-component manufacturing for high-voltage battery production. Having started with the production of battery modules for the BMW Group production network, facilities were expanded within four years to include further stages of manufacturing and additional production lines. Since the start of MINI Countryman Electric production in March 2024, Plant Leipzig has carried out the entire process of high-voltage battery manufacturing for the fifth generation of batteries, with its five cell-coating lines, three module assembly lines and two lines for high-voltage battery assembly. The batteries are used in the MINI Countryman Electric and fully electric BMW models at various BMW Group sites.\n\nFrom rear-wheel to front-wheel drive\n\nIt’s not just the BMW i8 that made 2014 a landmark year: it was also the year production of the first generation of BMW 2 Series Active Tourer began. This brought fundamental change to BMW Group Plant Leipzig: it was the first ever BMW with a front-wheel drive architecture and paved the way for this drive technology to become integrated into Plant Leipzig’s production lines. Thanks to Leipzig’s flexibility, the sports activity tourer was able to roll off the same line as the BMW 1 Series, 2 Series and first-generation BMW X1, all of which are rear-wheel drives.\n\nIntegrating the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer required just a few minor adjustments to the paintshop and assembly, but in the bodyshop, its new front-wheel drive concept and vehicle architecture meant a whole new production area was needed. About a year and a half later, production of a plug-in hybrid model was launched: the BMW 225xe. Like the BMW i8, this featured a combined combustion-engine and electric drive. Its successor, the second-generation BMW Active Tourer, in production since 2021, is also manufactured with either a plug-in hybrid drive or an internal combustion engine. In 2021, Leipzig’s rear-wheel drive era came to an end when the BMW 2 Series Coupé, BMW 2 Series Convertible and BMW M2 were phased out.\n\nProduction of the MINI Countryman is another USP of Plant Leipzig within the production network: it is the only full vehicle production facility in the BMW Group to produce BMW- and MINI-badged cars on one and the same production line.\n\nImportant employer in the region\n\nWith some 6,800 BMW employees and more than 11,000 people based locally, the BMW Group plant is a major contributor to the economy and a key employer in the region. When it first went on stream, it had roughly 2,600 BMW employees, with plans for around 5,500 jobs over the medium term.\n\nIn 2001, when Leipzig was chosen as the site for a new plant, the enthusiasm and welcome across the region were huge. Job applications poured in. On the day of the announcement alone, the specially established call centre took more than 4,000 calls. Over the next few days, the post bags were full, and by September 2001 thirty-five apprentices had become the first cohort to receive an employment contract with BMW Group Plant Leipzig. Since then, Leipzig has trained some 1,100 apprentices.\n\nLast year Plant Leipzig opened its Talent Campus. This accommodates training and development spaces in a single new building on the plant premises, offering the perfect conditions for employee training.\n\nIn 2024 the MINI Countryman meant production volumes increased, marking another first for Leipzig: the introduction of nightshifts – unprecedented in the history of the plant.Today, BMW and MINI vehicles are manufactured round the clock, in three shifts. The additional shift has created jobs for another 900 employees.\n\nProgressive energy management\n\nPlanning the BMW plant in Leipzig, efficient and sustainable processes played a crucial role – not just in vehicle production but in energy supplies as well. Visible from afar, the plant’s four wind turbines are among its landmark features and have been powering production with green energy since 2013. With a total capacity of 10 megawatts, they generate 26 gigawatt hours a year of electricity from wind energy – enough to cover about 15 percent of the plant’s total energy needs.\n\nIn addition, BMW Group Plant Leipzig is equipped for interim energy storage, with a battery storage farm that went into operation in 2017. This comprises up to 700 second-life high-voltage batteries from BMW i3 cars, enabling us to optimise local energy management and help stabilise the electricity network.\n\nLooking to the future, BMW Group Plant Leipzig attaches great importance to hydrogen as a fuel. In pursuit of its vision of largely decarbonising production – by replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen – it will need sufficient supplies from a grid. A regional hydrogen network is currently under construction, and Plant Leipzig plans to tap into it.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig has extensive experience of working with hydrogen, having already used it for in-house plant logistics for more than a decade. A pioneer in the automotive industry, it opened Germany’s first indoor hydrogen filling station in 2013. It now operates five such facilities for refuelling forklifts and tug trains in intralogistics. Its hydrogen fuel cell-powered fleet currently consists of over 200 vehicles and is one of the largest in Europe.\n\nPlant Leipzig was also the first car plant in the world to introduce a brand-new bivalent burner technology that can run on either natural gas or hydrogen. It can even switch between the two while operations are ongoing. In the paintshop, five such gas- and hydrogen-capable burners are currently used to dry the contrast roofs of the MINI Countryman, BMW 1 Series and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, and another six have replaced the previous systems in the PVC drying section.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig is currently undergoing further extensions and upgrades in preparation for forthcoming models – and for the next 20 years in its history.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig – Key milestones:\n\nAll BMW Models made by BMW Group Plant Leipzig\n\nBMW 3 Series Sedan E90\n\nBMW 1 Series three door E81\n\nBMW 1 Series Coupé E82\n\nBMW 1 Series Convertible E88\n\nBMW 1 Series M Coupé E82\n\nBMW 1 Series five door F20\n\nBMW 2 Series Coupé F22\n\nBMW 2 Series Active Tourer F45\n\nBMW 2 Series Convertible F23\n\nBMW 1 Series five door F40\n\nBMW 2 Series Gran Coupé F44\n\nBMW 2 Series Active Tourer U06\n\nBMW 1 Series five door F70\n\nBMW 2 Series Gran Coupé F74"}

All locations in the BMW Group production network are able to manufacture different drive train types and model variants on a single line – from internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids to fully-electric drive trains. A combination of plant splits – where a model is produced at multiple locations, flexible substitution of drive train variants and smart distribution of vehicle concepts ensures good capacity utilisation at all sites.\n\nThe German plants lead the way on e-mobility in the BMW Group’s production network: The sites in Munich, Dingolfing, Regensburg and Leipzig all produce at least one model for the global market alongside traditional drive technologies. Even in a volatile environment, the BMW Group continues to grow at its domestic locations, manufacturing over a million vehicles there last year (2024: 1,087,067; +16% YOY). The BMW Group thus accounts for a quarter of the automotive industry's total production volume in Germany.\n\nHowever, electromobility is not just making inroads at the company’s German plants. The BMW Group’s Chinese plants have fully-electric vehicles in their production portfolio and Plant Spartanburg (USA) is gearing up for electrification. From 2026, it will build fully-electric vehicles alongside its existing production portfolio. Starting in 2027, Plant San Luis Potosí in Mexico will also ramp up the fully-electric vehicles of the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nAs one of the pioneers of e-mobility, the BMW Group soon recognised that the ramp-up would not be linear but would progress at varying speeds. In the initial phase of the ramp-up, it primarily relied on “flex-plants”, which can manufacture both vehicles with internal combustion engines and electric drive trains. In this way the company is able to ensure its delivery capabilities in different market situations and maintain good capacity utilisation at individual locations.\n\nWith increasing electrification of the product portfolio, the plant environment is also changing. By the end of the decade, the BMW Group expects a significant increase in the market shares of fully-electric vehicles. For this reason, the plant in Debrecen and, later, the main plant in Munich will be the first facilities dedicated exclusively to fully-electric vehicles, enhancing electrification capacities across the network. The fully-electric NEUE KLASSE will launch at the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary before the end of the year. Once refurbishment is complete, the main plant in Munich will also produce only fully-electric vehicles from 2027.\n\nThe ability to make flexible substitutions is also a feature at plants designed solely for electric vehicles: Shifts in drive train variant production can be managed within the network. This enables the production network to respond in an agile manner to different scenarios in the ongoing ramp-up of e-mobility.\n\nIn addition to flexible substitution, BMW Group production is also characterised by “flexibility elements”. Order flexibility enables customers to modify their vehicle configuration up until six days before production begins. Volume flexibility relies on the sites’ flexible work-time models, which are constantly being refined. Measures include short-term tools, such as shift extensions and breaks, as well as medium-term modifications to shift models. A third shift was added at both the Regensburg and Leipzig plants.\n\nProduction follows the market – globally balanced plant capacity allocation The main criterion for plant capacity allocation, i.e. determining which models are produced at which plants, is proximity to the market. For example, Plant Spartanburg is the Competence Centre for BMW X models, because the US is the main sales market for the BMW Group’s Sports Activity Vehicles. Production and sales volumes both totalled just under 400,000 units in 2024. Almost 50 percent of all BMWs sold in the US in 2024 were built at Plant Spartanburg.\n\nThe Chinese market accounts for more than a quarter of the BMW Group’s total sales. The region is so large that the BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) joint venture produces vehicles almost exclusively for the local market. Here, also, sales and production volumes are closely aligned (2024 sales: 715,159; 2024 production: 695,579). Almost 90 percent of vehicles produced locally in China are also sold there.\n\nThe German plants in Munich, Regensburg and Leipzig manufacture UKL and compact-class vehicles primarily for the European market. Other locations, such as South Africa and Mexico, benefit from established free trade agreements.\n\nThe BMW Group's global distribution of value creation forms an important foundation for the resilience of its overall system, strengthening its ability to navigate trade policy and geopolitics. It also mitigates risks associated with currency fluctuations."}

BMW Group Plant Munich is gearing up to launch the NEUE KLASSE in summer 2026. During ongoing series operation, three new production halls are currently being built for the body shop, assembly and associated production logistics. “For the production start of the NEUE KLASSE, we will have a state-of-the-art plant in Munich that is characterised by flexibility, innovation and, above all, efficiency,” says Plant Director Peter Weber.\n\nStarting in 2027, the plant in Munich will exclusively produce fully-electric vehicles, further enhancing efficiency boost. Forward planning, close cooperation with development teams and suppliers, and the integration of modern production technology within new structures will all play a key role. “With the NEUE KLASSE, we will significantly reduce manufacturing costs at the Munich Plant,” says Weber. In addition to optimised production processes and targeted automation, the NEUE KLASSE’s new vehicle architecture will also leverage further efficiencies. Focusing on a single drive train variant reduces production steps and the number of parts – for example, for wiring harnesses, which previously varied according to engine type and can be complex to install.\n\nUnusual process: Pre-series production at pilot plant The timeline for the ramp-up in Munich is carefully synchronised – in part due to the plant’s refurbishment. The first pre-series vehicles will be built at the pilot plant of the BMW Group Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ), with support from Plant Munich’s production team, before the end of the year. “Alongside the pilot plant at the FIZ, we are also using virtual simulations to ensure a smooth ramp-up,” says Weber, describing the unusual situation in the decisive year ahead of the launch. He adds that Plant Munich’s experienced launch team is also working closely with colleagues at the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where the first NEUE KLASSE model will enter production late this year.\n\nInternational production network: Cooperation, flexibility and innovative processes BMW Group plants are capable of producing different model variants and drive train types on a single line. Since the ramp-up of electromobility is not linear and will progress at varying speeds, the company has relied on “flex-plants”, which can manufacture vehicles with both internal combustion engines and electric drive trains. “In this way, we can ensure our delivery capabilities in different market situations and maintain good capacity utilisation at our locations,” explains Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management responsible for Production.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the BMW Group expects a significant increase in the market shares of fully-electric vehicles. For this reason, the plants in Debrecen and, later, Munich will be the first facilities dedicated exclusively to fully-electric vehicles, enhancing electrification capacities throughout the network.\n\nThe German plants lead the way on e-mobility in the BMW Group’s production network: Alongside traditional drive technologies, each of them builds at least one fully-electric model for the global market. Even in a volatile environment, the BMW Group continues to grow its domestic locations, manufacturing over a million vehicles there last year – accounting for a quarter of Germany's total automotive production.\n\nAt the same time, the company’s production also depends on a balanced global distribution of value creation. “The strategic and flexible structure of our production network strengthens our resilience and makes us more competitive,” adds Nedeljković.\n\nFocus on employees: Developing skills for e-mobility The shift towards electrified vehicles also brings changes to employee roles and required skills. With the flexible ramp-up of e-mobility at BMW Group plants, employees can gradually be prepared for new job content.\n\n“Despite technical and structural innovations, our focus is always on people. We take pride in our employees’ expertise and experience, and their dedication to continuous improvement. It is thanks to their commitment that we are able to consistently deliver premium-quality vehicles,” emphasises Weber. Additional expertise will be developed and retained at the company through extensive further training and workforce flexibility. Last year alone, nearly 25,000 employees completed e-mobility training. Plant Munich is currently holding its third industrial electrician qualification course, conducted in cooperation with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK).\n\nIn recent years, around 5,500 jobs have been created across the BMW Group production network for the current and upcoming generation of e-drives. More than three quarters of these positions were filled through internal reorganisation.\n\nFor further information about flexibility in the BMW Group production network please also note the background document in the download section."}

Moreover, since 2014, the South Carolina plant has exported more than 2.7 million BMWs – about 63 percent of total production – with an export value of more than $104 billion.\n\n“Plant Spartanburg has been an important location in our production network for over 30 years and is now the largest BMW Group plant globally,” explained Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Production. “The strong export share of our plant underlines the importance of free trade for the USA. Not only does this benefit our plant, but also the strong supplier network in the region.”\n\n“When the first BMW rolled off the assembly line in 1994, it was the beginning of a great legacy for Plant Spartanburg in the United States. Our dedicated associates have assembled nearly seven million BMWs, and because of our export success, millions of customers around the world experience the innovative technology and premium quality of our X vehicles,” said Robert Engelhorn, president and CEO of BMW Manufacturing. “Our achievement as the country’s leading automotive exporter demonstrates BMW’s trusted partnership with this state and our continued commitment to the United States.”\n\n\"South Carolina's position as a stronghold for the United States' automotive industry can be traced directly to BMW's success in our state. The BMW models assembled at Plant Spartanburg are in global demand — shipping to markets around the world,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. “We are proud to have a company as committed to the prosperity of its community, the success of its employees, and the innovation of its industry right here in South Carolina. We look forward to celebrating many more milestones with BMW in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe BMWs assembled at the South Carolina plant were exported primarily through the Port of Charleston, SC, as well as through four additional ports on the East Coast. The top export markets from Plant Spartanburg were Germany, South Korea, China, Canada, and Great Britain.\n\nPlant Highlights from 2024\n\nThe team at BMW Manufacturing assembled 396,117 Sports Activity Vehicles and Coupes last year. As part of that total, more than 57,000 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles were assembled, which made up more than 14 percent of the plant’s total volume. Nearly 50 percent of all BMWs sold in the U.S. were assembled at Plant Spartanburg.\n\nOther plant highlights from 2024 include:\n\nSince 1992, the BMW Group has invested more than $14.8 billion in its South Carolina operations. BMW Manufacturing is the largest BMW Group plant in the world, assembling more than 1,500 vehicles each day. Nearly 57 percent of its vehicles are shipped to about 120 global markets, making BMW the largest automotive exporter by value in the United States for more than a decade. In 2024, nearly 50 percent of BMW vehicles sold in the U.S. came from Plant #Spartanburg. It employs more than 11,000 people."}

A double title win in the “Best Cars” poll of German car magazine “auto motor und sport” sees BMW celebrating a successful start to 2025. Readers voted the BMW 2 Series Coupé the class winner in the compact segment for the fourth time in succession, with a 13.2 per cent share of the vote. As in the previous year, the BMW X1 took first place in the “Compact SUV/Off-road Vehicle” category. It garnered 8.4 per cent of the votes cast. Around 95,000 readers took part in the 49th edition of the prestigious “Best Cars” awards. From a total of 462 models, they chose one overall winner and one import winner in each of 13 vehicle classes.\n\nThree more current BMW models won awards at the 2025 “Car of the Year Awards” organised by British car magazine “What Car?”. As in the year before, the BMW 4 Series was victorious in the “Best Coupé/Convertible” category. The BMW M3 Touring took “Best Performance Car” honours with its combination of outstanding driving dynamics and great everyday usability. This was another model that repeated its success from the year prior. The “Best Luxury Car” title once again went to the BMW X7, as it did in 2024.\n\nWith these latest awards, BMW is continuing the string of successes it achieved in prestigious national and international competitions in 2024, which saw BMW vehicles from a wide range of market segments come out on top in both reader surveys and expert jury decisions.\n\nNew BMW 5 Series overall winner of “German Car of the Year” 2025.\n\nAt the end of 2024, a jury of 40 motoring journalists crowned the new BMW 5 Series “German Car of the Year”. In doing so, they declared the executive sedan’s latest generation the best new car released on the German car market over the previous twelve months. The new BMW 5 Series Sedan and Touring models particularly impressed the jury with their hallmark driving dynamics combined with long-distance comfort and a wide choice of powertrains. In addition to plug-in hybrids and highly efficient internal combustion engines, the portfolio also includes the all-electric BMW i5 Sedan and BMW i5 Touring models.\n\nBut the “German Car of the Year” award was just one of the numerous accolades that the new BMW 5 Series won in the course of 2024. It also came first in the 2024 “World Luxury Car” competition. A jury of around 100 international motoring journalists declared the new BMW 5 Series the winner out of a field of 13 luxury vehicles.\n\nIn the UK, “Fleet News” magazine honoured the BMW 5 Series with its “Best Executive Car” title. Renowned British car magazine “Autocar” gave the new BMW 5 Series its “Autocar Award 2024” in the “Best Hybrid” category.\n\nTriumphs for BMW: “Golden Steering Wheel” and “Auto Trophy”.\n\n“Auto Bild” and the car valuation company “Schwacke” also crowned the BMW 540d xDrive Touring its “2024 Residuals Champion” (“Wertmeister”). They expect it to experience the lowest depreciation in its class over the next four years.\n\nThe success story of the new BMW 5 Series continued in 2024 at the 37th edition of the “Auto Trophy” awards organised by German car magazine “Auto Zeitung”. Readers of the print edition and users of “autozeitung.de” voted it the winner in the “Executive Class/Luxury Class” category. This was not the only accolade for BMW at the 2024 “Auto Trophy” event. The Munich-based premium car manufacturer received a total of eight awards. BMW won the “Auto Trophy” “Best Brand” poll with 22.4 per cent of all votes cast. The new BMW 1 Series came out on top in the “City Cars/Small Cars/Compact Class” segment. With a 26.1 per cent share of the vote, the BMW 3 Series landed a clear victory in the compact executive class. Readers of “Auto Zeitung” were equally impressed with the new BMW X3 and awarded it a commanding first place in the “SUVs from 30,000 to 60,000 euros” category. Finally, the BMW X5 once again won the storied award in the “SUVs from 60,000 euros” price bracket. The BMW iX took first place in the “Electric SUVs from 50,000 euros” segment, while the BMW iX1 triumphed as the best “Electric SUV up to 50,000 euros”.\n\nAll-electric BMW models enjoy international success.\n\nNumerous additional awards emphasise the global importance of all-electric BMW models on the international market. In February 2025, the “Automobile Journalists Association of Canada” presented the BMW i4 with the prestigious “Canadian Electric Car of the Year” award for the second time. For the Canadian jury of experts, the inspiring performance and excellent range of the BMW i4’s electric powertrain were as important to their decision as its impressive braking system and the quality of its interior.\n\nThe British car magazine “Diesel&EcoCar” honoured the BMW i5 as the “Best Electric Executive Car” in 2024, while the BMW iX won in the “Best Electric Luxury SUV” category. The BMW i7 was awarded the “Best Electric Luxury Car” title.\n\nIn Germany, BMW collected additional accolades in the second edition of the “Auto Trophy Elektro” event organised by car magazine “Auto Zeitung”. The BMW i5 Sedan received the most votes in the electric sedan segment while the BMW iX1 took first place in the “Electric SUVs up to 50,000 euros” class. Moreover, the 2024 “Auto Trophy Elektro” award for the “Most Sustainable Brand” once again went to BMW, as it did in the year before.\n\nAccolades for the new BMW 3 Series.\n\nThe BMW 3 Series won the 2024 “autonis Award” for best new design of the year in the “Compact Executive” bracket. It made first place in the reader’s poll of German car magazine “auto motor und sport”, ahead of the BMW 4 Series Coupé/Gran Coupé. The BMW 3 Series also received further honours on the international stage. In the UK, it was voted “Best Plug-in Hybrid Large Car” by “Diesel&EcoCar” magazine. The same publication also named the BMW 3 Series Touring its “Best Plug-in Hybrid Estate Car”. Another trophy came from the United States. The US car magazine “Car and Driver” included the BMW 3 Series in its 2024 “Editors’ Choice” list, in the “Entry-Luxury Car” category. In 2024, a total of 13 BMW models made it onto the renowned editorial team’s list of recommended vehicles. Meanwhile, the BMW X1 brought home a clear victory in the German “Auto Bild” car magazine’s SUV category for company cars (“Firmenwagen Award 2024”).\n\nWith the “Paul Pietsch Award”, BMW won one of the most prestigious accolades of the 2024 automotive year. In their vote for the most important automotive innovation of the year, the expert jury of German car magazine “auto motor und sport” chose the BMW Highway Assistant. It enables drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel for longer periods of time.

The company makes use of numerous BMW title tournaments around the world to provide world-class sport and an impressive spectator experience, while also fulfilling its responsibility as a corporate citizen and participating in solutions to social challenges. At next week’s BMW Golf Cup World Final in Bangkok, the BMW Group will donate €1,000 to UNICEF* educational programmes for each net eagle recorded during the tournament. With Eagles for Education, the BMW Group supports the work of the UN International Children’s Fund UNICEF to provide young people with the skills and knowledge they require to enjoy success in the working world of tomorrow and chart their own path through life.\n\nTracing its origins back to 1982, the BMW Golf Cup is the largest international tournament series for amateur golfers. Each season sees national competitions taking place in more than 30 countries, with the winners receiving an invitation to the World Final. This provides the opportunity to experience a pro-standard international tournament, enjoy a fascinating support programme and evening events and meet golfing enthusiasts from around the world in a friendly environment. Next week, the World Final for the 2024 season will be held in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, for the first time. The tournament at the exclusive Alpine Golf Club will feature players competing for the individual title in three categories (two for men, one for women) and battling for top spot in the team standings, which are determined by the (net) individual results. Participants will also be aiming to support a good cause with their sporting achievements as they attempt to surpass the total of € 49,000 recorded for “Eagles for Education” at last year’s World Final.\n\nEagles for Education is part of a collaboration between the BMW Group and UNICEF, under the slogan “BRIDGE. Educating young people for tomorrow, today”. The focus of the collaboration is to bridge learning gaps within society and create learning and education opportunities in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) – because STEM professions are particularly important given that they are the engine of global economic growth.\n\nA lack of qualifications is already leading to a worldwide shortage of expertise. Millions of jobs are expected to go unfilled in the future. Studies show that the problem is particularly acute in low and middle-income countries and affects girls and women more frequently. Nowadays, females remain the minority in STEM education and professions. Together, UNICEF and the BMW Group are working to reduce the growing inequality in global education.\n\nThe list of countries where the BMW Group and UNICEF are working together includes South Africa (venue for the BMW Golf Cup World Final last year), Brazil, India, Mexico and Thailand – all countries which have BMW Group presence. At this year's World Final in Thailand, “Eagles for Education” will therefore continue to follow the principle of social commitment to which the company has dedicated itself: think global, act local.\n\n*UNICEF does not endorse any company, brand, product or service."}

I am proud to be a BMW M works driver, and to share this passion. The fact that there is now a special VR46 edition, in which I was involved from the very beginning of the design process, makes me proud. When I see the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 out on the road or on the race track later, it will be very cool,” says Valentino Rossi about the edition and the collaboration with BMW M.\n\nThe yellow accents continue in the interior of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, which is predominantly Night Blue. The M Carbon bucket seats come with Merino leather upholstery in the Black/Night Blue colour combination. The Sao Paulo Yellow of the Alcantara shoulder area creates an exclusive contrast. The head restraints, like the door sill trims, feature a prominent yellow VR46 logo. Furthermore, the M Alcantara steering wheel with three-spoke design and flat-bottomed rim comes with yellow contrast stitching and a yellow centre marker. On the carbon-fibre centre console of all examples of the Edition VR46 is a badge stating “1/46”, identifying each Sport or Style car as one of the limited run.\n\nSix-cylinder in-line engine with 405 kW/550 hpThe beating heart of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 is a high-revving 3.0-litre, six‑cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology. This power unit has had track performance as its raison d’être from day one of its development. The increase in the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and model-specific tweaks to the engine management mean the edition model’s engine now generates 405 kW/550 hp, which is relayed to the road via an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission, the M xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system and the Active M Differential. Lightning-fast power development and optimised traction enable the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds, and from 0 to 200 km/h in 11.1 seconds. When applying the “1-foot rollout” method**, the figures read 3.1 seconds for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h and 10.8 seconds for 0 to 200 km/h. Acceleration from 80 to 120 km/h takes 2.6 seconds in fourth gear and 3.3 seconds in fifth. The top speed of the edition model, which comes with the M Driver’s Package as standard, is electronically limited to 302 km/h.\n\nContributing to the excellent engine response is a model-specific engine mounting with increased spring rates. The rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure enables particularly direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain every time the driver presses the accelerator. The oil supply system – like the cooling system – is designed to handle the specific challenges of track use, including consistently high revs and extreme lateral acceleration. The engine’s power delivery is accompanied by the emotionally stirring soundtrack generated by the dual-branch exhaust system, which features electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt black.\n\nModel-specific tuning for chassis technology and control systemsThe chassis technology for the new BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 has been tuned precisely to the performance characteristics of the engine, the overall vehicle concept and its weight distribution. The individually tuned axle kinematics and bespoke wheel camber settings, dampers, auxiliary springs and anti-roll bars serve to optimise steering precision, transmission of lateral control forces when cornering, spring and damping response, and wheel location. The electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension likewise come in a model-specific set-up, as do the electromechanical M Servotronic steering with variable ratio, and the integrated braking system.\n\n46 – the trademark of an exceptional racer The number 46 has accompanied Valentino Rossi throughout his extraordinary career as a motorcycle racer and racing driver, and has become even more of a trademark than his nickname “The Doctor” or “Il Dottore”. Having seen his father Graziano Rossi race motorcycles with number 46, Valentino also opted for 46 from the start of his career – and never even swapped it for number 1 when he became world champion, as would have been his right.\n\nValentino Rossi claimed his first world title in the 125cc class in 1997. Two years later, he added the title in the 250cc class. In 2000, he took the step up to what was the top Grand Prix category, the 500cc class, in which he was crowned world champion in 2001. The following year, this category was replaced by the MotoGP class, and Rossi remained the dominant force. By 2005 he had added a further four world titles, and numbers eight and nine were to follow in 2008 and 2009. With these nine world championships and no fewer than 115 Grand Prix victories to his name, he is one of the three most successful motorcycle racers in history and a global motor sport and style icon. VR46 has become a worldwide trademark – and Rossi’s home town of Tavullia has even reduced its speed limit from the usual 50 km/h to 46 km/h in his honour.\n\nBMW M works driver since the start of 2023When the curtain fell on his motorcycle career at the finale to the 2021 season, Valentino Rossi turned his attention solely to car racing, having already attended multiple tests in Formula 1 race cars and made guest appearances in rallies and endurance races. Since the start of the 2023 season, he has been a BMW M works driver, plying his trade at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 for BMW M Team WRT in series including the GT World Challenge Europe and the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) – which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). At the start of February 2025, he finished runner-up in a BMW M4 GT3 at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), the opening round of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC).\n\nExclusive meeting with Valentino Rossi in ItalyAn exclusive bonus that comes with purchasing a BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 is the opportunity to enjoy a very special two-day experience in Italy. Day one features a visit to the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia, including a barbecue and a chance to talk shop with Valentino Rossi himself.

We aim to build on the clear upward trend from the second half of the 2024 season and be in a position to consistently compete for podium places with our BMW M Hybrid V8. This applies to the entire season, but especially for the major highlight at Le Mans. Here in Qatar, we want to start the year with good results. During the prologue, we focused on running through our intensive test programme and gathering important information. Finishing with the fastest time is always nice, and we’re heading into race week with a positive mindset. In the LMGT3 class, we are looking forward to the debut of the new BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The car has won its first two races, demonstrating its great potential. The clear season goal is to contend for the World Championship title and a victory at Le Mans.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “So far, I think, we have a good working base. We gathered good and important information. I am quite happy. We did not have any major issues with the cars. Of course, there is still some work to be done but overall, we are quite satisfied.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8): “We were following the plan. I got many laps but of course it’s testing and you never know how competitive you are so we were just focusing on the programme. Things are running according to plan and we keep working. Now I’m looking forward to the race.”\n\nRobin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8): “I think it went alright. We had a test programme before arriving at Qatar, we followed it pretty much and everything feels fine. Now we need to put the puzzle together and prepare ourselves for the race which is a bit different. As we don’t drive at night during FP1 and FP2, Saturday was our only opportunity so that was quite important for us. Now it’s all about discussions and see how we can improve the package we have for the race.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “The track here has a big evolution across the weekend by having a lot of sand on the first day so it’s our job to understand the track evolution and the tyre evolution. This year, we are racing with a brand-new EVO car so we also have a lot to learn on that side. Overall it’s good to be back in the FIA WEC paddock and also to get to know my new teammates. It has been the first time that I met them and we have a good spirit. So let’s get everything ready for the big one.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “First of all, it was good to have two days of testing before the start of the season because you have a bit of time to work on the car, other than during the race. I think that we improved a lot from Friday to Saturday and the feeling is not so bad. The tyre consumption makes a big difference here, so we tried a lot of things to improve this aspect that was a bit difficult for us sometimes in the past. Overall, it is difficult to understand where we are at the moment. We need to wait for the race. But on Saturday I felt comfortable with the car, I was able to drive a double stint and my pace was good so it is positive and the team always works hard. We are not the fastest yet, we need to improve but we are on a good way.”\n\nThe BMW M Motorsport line-ups at a glance:\n\nHypercar class, BMW M Team WRT\n\n#20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8\n\nSheldon van der Linde\n\nLMGT3 class , The Bend Team WRT, Team WRT\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Pro)\n\nTimur Boguslavskiy (Silver)\n\nValentino Rossi (Silver)\n\nYasser Shahin (Bronze)\n\nAhmad Al Harthy (Bronze)"}

The first races of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) are in the books. The Australian Phillip Island season opener turned out to be a rollercoaster of emotions for BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. On Saturday, defending World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) finished second in the first race of the year, securing a podium finish. However, Sunday proved to be a challenging day for ‘El Turco’ and his teammate Michael van der Mark (NED).\n\nThe team arrived in Australia after a demanding final phase of pre-season preparation. Due to a regulation change, the new BMW M 1000 RR, which had been developed for racing over the winter, had to be adapted. Additionally, Razgatlioglu sustained a finger injury in January. BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team took advantage of WorldSBK’s two-day test on Monday and Tuesday before the race weekend to fine-tune the optimal set-up for the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit. After a crash on Monday, Razgatlioglu sat out the remainder of the first day but returned to testing on Tuesday.\n\nFollowing Friday’s free practice sessions, the action got serious on Saturday. Razgatlioglu marked his return to the front row with P2 in Superpole qualifying, while van der Mark secured seventh place. The two BMW factory riders were the only ones able to challenge a dominant line-up of Ducati riders in Superpole and the races. In the first of the two main races, which both featured a mandatory pit stop for a tyre change, Razgatlioglu remained among the front runners from the start and ultimately finished second, with only Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) ahead of him. Van der Mark worked his way into the top five but unfortunately crashed out.\n\nSunday kicked off with the short Superpole race, which saw a moment of drama in the first lap when Razgatlioglu nearly crashed and ran straight into the gravel. He rejoined at the back of the field and launched a comeback, making his way up to P13. Van der Mark initially surged to third place but later encountered issues, crossing the finish line in 14th. That meant the duo started the final main race from tenth and 12th on the grid. Razgatlioglu gained multiple positions in the opening laps, breaking into the top five before the pit stop. However, after changing tyres, he had to return to the pits again due to a technical issue, forcing him to retire from the race. The cause of the problem is still under investigation. Van der Mark fought hard, but P14 was the most he could achieve.\n\nWorldSBK now returns to Europe, with the second round taking place on the last weekend of March in Portimão, Portugal. BMW Motorrad Motorsport will use the break to analyse the first races, continue working hard, and prepare for the long European leg of the season.\n\nReactions after the Phillip Island season opener.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “When we arrived at Phillip Island it was clear that it would not be an easy weekend for us because we just missed testing time with all the obstacles we had over winter. With Toprak’s finger injury, he missed a lot of testing time, we had a lot of rainy days as well and there has been the concession topic so we came to Phillip Island still investigating the best direction for our set-up. I think on Saturday we showed potential but Sunday was definitely a tough day for us. It is something we will focus on now and we will get back stronger together at Portimão. We had a good test there so we are confident that we can have a better weekend. The most important thing is that we now have a couple of weeks at home to really go deep into the analysis, then we test again and I am sure we will come back stronger. We just have to find our sweet spot for the bike. This weekend showed that there is potential. Sometimes we found the right way and sometimes we were struggling. It is part of the game. From being the hunter to be being the hunted it was clear that it will not be easier than last year but we take on the challenge. We finished this first weekend not as we would have liked to, but now we are for sure looking forward to Portimão.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “It was a very intense week with many ups and downs, a mix of light and shadow. However, we learned a lot, which means we can now head to Portimão with plenty of valuable information. There, we will first test before the second round of the season takes place. During Monday and Tuesday’s Phillip Island test we gathered a lot of insights for the race weekend, learned a great deal about the bike, and I think Toprak’s Superpole time showed that the performance of the motorcycle is still there. This year, it is a bit more difficult to fully maximise it, but both riders delivered a strong performance in the first main race. Toprak’s podium was, of course, the highlight of the weekend, and Mickey had a very strong race pace until his high-speed crash, which he fortunately walked away from unharmed. That is what we take away from this weekend. The bike has the performance, and the areas where we still need to fine-tune the balance will now be worked on at home and during the test in Portimão.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am never very happy after the first races of the season which has been the case in the past years – the season opener is always strange. To get the podium in race one was not easy; thanks to my team as in every session they improved the bike. I felt a bit better on the bike in that race and we did a very good job. At the start of the Superpole race, I had a big problem and was lucky not to hit someone and to avoid a big crash. For race two we said it would be better to ride yesterday’s bike because I felt that we had been really improving and the grip was much better than before but during the race there was a problem and I could not continue. But I now only focus on the next race. Finally we are going to Europe and I’m just starting to fight with all the Ducatis because this is almost like a Ducati Cup. Nicolò Bulega was strong here last year, so I was not surprised that he was fast. Congratulations to him, he did a very good job and deserves it. I think that we will fight more this year. Álvaro Bautista is also strong, but this year, all Ducatis were in front. This is not normal and I hope that it will not continue like this. Now we have a long break of almost one month and we will work hard and try to come back stronger. We have a test at Portimão and these two test days are really important because we try to improve the bike. We are still not at hundred percent but I know that everyone is pushing hard.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Honestly, this week has been a bit disappointing. We’ve been testing a lot, we tried a lot of things but we never really got a nice feeling with the bike. It has been very strange because we really tried everything. Then on Saturday, when the temperature was very high, I did a good lap in Superpole and managed to qualify in seventh position so that was positive. In race one, when we had very high temperatures, I was doing very well. I was enjoying it and the bike felt very good so I was confident but unfortunately I crashed out and for some reason on Sunday we did not have any good feeling at all. We have to find out why the bike felt so different on Sunday. Now we are going back to Europe, we have a two-day test at Portimão and it’s good that we can do a lot of testing there and make sure that we can do a lot better at Portimão.”\n\nAir temperature: 33°, track temperature: 33°, humidity: 38%, conditions: dry.\n\nAruba.it Racing Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAir temperature: 36°, track temperature: 40°, humidity: 32%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 2, 1:29.345\n\nAir temperature: 22°, track temperature: 32°, humidity: 71%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 3, 1:28.914\n\nAir temperature: 22°, track temperature: 36°, humidity: 58%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Álvaro Bautista, lap 11, 1:28.836\n\nCurrent riders‘ classification (R01/12, after 3 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R01/12, after 3 of 36 races)."}

The BMW Group is presenting its next leap forward in the field of electric drive technology – and in the process ushering in a new era of all-electric driving. At the Tech Days event in Landshut, the company has provided some initial insights into the development and production of high-voltage batteries and electric drive systems using the sixth generation of BMW eDrive technology. Every fully electric Neue Klasse vehicle will enjoy the benefits. The first Neue Klasse model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. Below is an overview of the technology highlights:\n\nAdopting a technology-open approach while setting the pace in electric mobility\n\n“For the BMW Group, electric mobility is the future and a key area of growth. We are leading the way with this drivetrain technology. At the same time, we are deliberately taking a technology-open approach, recognizing that mobility needs vary between different regions of the world,” explains Dr Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Purchasing and Supplier Network. “We want to offer our customers the best drive concept for every need. It is possible to do both: offer the best drive technology for every need and be at the forefront of electric mobility.”\n\nSlimmer, faster, further: the high-voltage batteries for Gen6\n\nWith the new sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology (Gen6 for short), the BMW Group is making a technological quantum leap. Improvements on the product side include a 30% faster charging speed and 30% increase in range, with certain models achieving even higher figures. Added to which, the Gen6 high-voltage battery concept benefits from the new 800V technology. Gen6 will make its debut this year in the Neue Klasse and subsequently be used to drive models across the BMW Group’s fully electric product range. The concept for the Gen6 high-voltage batteries is fundamentally new and will find applications in all vehicle segments – right up to the high-performance models from BMW M GmbH. Its new, even slimmer design allows the high-voltage battery to be integrated into a spread of different models, regardless of vehicle height. The high-voltage battery takes on the role of a structural component in the bodies of the Neue Klasse models (“pack-to-open-body”), and the new cylindrical cells will be integrated directly into the high-voltage battery (“cell-to-pack”). The new BMW cylindrical cell has a 20% greater energy density than its predecessor, the Gen5 prismatic battery cell. And charging in both directions will be possible: the BMW Group has confirmed bidirectional charging as an option for Gen6.\n\nHighly intelligent central control unit: the BMW Energy Master\n\nAll of the elements that enable this technological leap forward come together in the BMW Energy Master. This central control unit is positioned on the high-voltage battery and provides the interface for high- and low-voltage power supply and for data from the high-voltage battery. It also controls the power supply for the electric motor and vehicle electrical system and ensures the safe and intelligent operation of the high-voltage battery. The BMW Group has filed a whole series of new patent applications for the vehicle electrical system, including its electronic fuses. Both the hardware and software of the Energy Master were developed fully in-house at the BMW Group. This ensures technological developments and updates for vehicles can be implemented independently and in real time via Remote Software Upgrades, providing a particular benefit for customers.\n\n“Local for local” approach for high-voltage battery assembly and supplier network\n\nThe high-voltage batteries for the Neue Klasse are assembled in five new production facilities that the BMW Group has located close to its vehicle plants as part of a “local for local” approach. For example, cutting-edge assembly locations for Gen6 high-voltage batteries are taking shape in Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff, near Spartanburg (USA). This approach safeguards production even in the event of unforeseen political and economic events. In addition, the existing locations are being strengthened, with jobs both secured and created. The “local for local” principle continues in the supplier network for battery cells: in order to cover the demand for Gen6, the BMW Group has reached contractual agreements for five battery cell factories – spread across Europe, China and the USA – with various partners.\n\n“Cell-to-pack” and “pack-to-open-body”\n\nProduction of the Gen6 high-voltage batteries follows the “cell-to-pack” and “pack-to-open-body” principles. “Cell-to-pack” involves positioning the cylindrical cells – manufactured by the suppliers according to BMW Group specifications – directly in the housing of the high-voltage battery, without the intermediate step of a module being produced. “Pack-to-open-body” refers to the high-voltage battery’s new role as a structural component in the vehicle architecture. Numerous innovations patented by the BMW Group can be found here.\n\nKnow-how from Bavaria and Austria – in demand around the world\n\nBefore series production of the high-voltage batteries gets underway worldwide, the production processes will be developed and pre-series batteries subjected to thorough testing. This will happen at the BMW Group pilot plants for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf, Hallbergmoos and Munich. The new series production plants around the world will then be ready. The product and process expertise is centred in Bavaria. Production of the Energy Master will take place at Plant Landshut, which will then supply all the high-voltage battery assembly plants around the world. There, the highly intelligent control unit will be installed on the high-voltage battery. The electric motor with sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology is produced at Plant Steyr in Austria, which is also home to a development centre for electric drive systems and thermal management.\n\nProduction of the Energy Master at BMW Group Plant Landshut\n\nA state-of-the-art production system for the BMW Energy Master is taking shape at Plant Landshut. The plant is currently producing the highly complex control unit in pre-series. Series production on the first production line will begin in August 2025, with a further expansion stage to follow in mid-2026. This is the first time the development and production of this central control unit has taken place in-house at the BMW Group. “As the company’s largest in-house component manufacturer, Landshut plays an important role for the Neue Klasse,” says Dr Joachim Post. “The plant is an innovation hub and a driver of transformation.” Around 200 people will be employed in the Energy Master production area at Landshut when production begins, rising to as many as 700 people as it ramps up further. The BMW Group has channelled investment in the high hundreds of millions of euros into the expansion of electric mobility at Plant Landshut since 2020, strengthening both the production facility itself and Germany’s status as an industrial powerhouse for the long term. The modular manufacturing system used to produce the Energy Master was also designed fully in-house by the BMW Group. It is supplied with subcomponents by a supply chain set up by the BMW Group. This extends to the n-tier supply chain for supply-critical components such as semiconductors. The benefits of this set-up can be seen in terms of both costs and supply security. The scalable production system enables the company to respond quickly and flexibly to market requirements. The high degree of automation, involving up to 400 robots in the final expansion stage, maximises efficiency. Comprehensive in-process monitoring, which includes the use of AI-based camera systems, and 100-per-cent end-of-line system checks in a clean-room environment ensure optimum quality.\n\nDifferent recycling processes within the value chain\n\nAs electric mobility ramps up, there is an increasing focus on recycling of high-voltage batteries at the end of their lifecycle. Under a long-term partnership with SK tes – a leading provider of innovative technology lifecycle solutions – cobalt, nickel and lithium from end-of-life batteries are recovered from the BMW Group and integrated into the supply chain for the manufacture of new batteries. This closed-loop approach increases the efficiency and resilience of the BMW Group as part of a circular economy. The BMW Group will follow a similar path in the USA, Mexico and Canada up to 2026 with a separate partnership.\n\nInnovative direct recycling at the BMW Group\n\nThe BMW Group is also exploring other recycling options in the value creation process. One example of this is the direct recycling method developed in-house. The BMW Group is working with its joint venture Encory to set up a competence centre for battery cell recycling in Lower Bavaria, where the company will put its direct recycling ideas into practice. This innovative process will enable residual materials from battery cell production and whole battery cells to be mechanically broken down into their valuable constituent components. The raw materials obtained in this way will be re-used directly in the pilot production process for battery cells at the company’s competence centres.\n\nTechnology-open approach for electric mobility: the new e-drive system of Gen6\n\nThe BMW Group has retained the principle of an electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) for its Gen6 power unit. On this type of synchronous motor, the magnetic field in the rotor is generated by windings fed with direct current rather than permanent magnets. In this way, the strength of the rotor’s magnetic field can be optimally adjusted to the prevailing load conditions. This results in both excellent levels of efficiency at customer-relevant operating points and constant power output at high rotational speeds. As with the Gen5 version, the synchronous motor will be positioned above the rear axle and feature a compact housing incorporating the electric drive unit, power electronics and transmission. Many of the motor’s technical details were created with the help of patented expertise, with the rotor alone accounting for more than ten patent applications.\n\nNeue Klasse additionally incorporates ASM technology\n\nThe Gen6 powertrain employs a second, additional electric motor technology in the form of the asynchronous motor (ASM). Here, instead of being generated by permanent magnets (PSM) or electrical excitation (EESM), the rotor’s magnetic field is induced by the stator. On this type of motor, the rotor takes the form of a metal cage. The asynchronous motor offers the advantage of a more compact design and superior cost efficiency. The ASM motor variants will be fitted at the front axle of Neue Klasse cars with BMW xDrive.\n\nExtensive improvements to EESM technology\n\nBesides the addition of ASM technology, the EESM technology has also undergone a major upgrade for Gen6: rotor, stator and inverter have all been fully designed for the new 800V architecture of the Gen6 tech in order to maximise drive system performance and efficiency. This has been further helped by a complete redesign of the oil and water cooling systems. In addition to this, the experts from the BMW Group have also succeeded in improving the electric motor and central housing in terms of their weight and rigidity too. The transmission still uses a two-stage helical design, but has been further optimised by enhancements to its geometry and cooling, lower friction levels and more pleasant acoustics. The electrically excited synchronous motor’s “brain”, the inverter, now features 800V technology along with silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors to boost efficiency. The inverter is completely integrated into the electric motor’s housing. Its task is to convert the DC power supply from the high-voltage battery to AC for use in the electric motor. The inverter was developed in-house by the BMW Group and is produced at Plant Steyr in Austria.\n\nLower weight, costs and energy losses – greater efficiency in the vehicle\n\nThe results obtained from intelligently incorporating new technologies into the electric powertrain while consistently enhancing existing systems make impressive reading. When compared to a Gen5 xDrive model, a future Neue Klasse model complete with EESM and ASM technology boasts the following improvements: energy losses have been reduced by 40%, costs by 20% and weight by 10%. By combining different types of electric motor, the BMW Group’s technology-open approach is therefore clearly in evidence within the field of electric mobility. In future, customers will be able to choose from models equipped with one, two, three or four electric motors to suit their individual preferences and requirements. The sixth generation BMW eDrive technology is a significant factor in the gain in overall vehicle efficiency of around 20 per cent for the Neue Klasse. This figure is based on a comparison with the current generation of all-electric vehicles from the BMW Group.\n\nModular concept provides crucial advantage for manufacturing electric motors\n\nThe manufacturing concept for the Gen6 electric drive system uses the principle of modular building blocks. This forms the basis for highly flexible manufacturing of various electric drive variants across the entire Neue Klasse model range. The modular \"building block” concept leads to positive economies of scale and cost savings in development and production. It also has the effect of improving the scalability of production volumes. The modular approach ensures a high degree of flexibility in production, the supply networks and procurement.\n\nThe Gen6 electric drive systems: made in Steyr\n\nSeries production of the Gen6 electric drive systems will commence at BMW Group Plant Steyr in summer 2025. Pre-production already got underway at the Austrian facility in September 2024. The pre-production motors are undergoing rigorous testing and some are already being fitted in Neue Klasse test vehicles from Plant Debrecen. By 2030, the BMW Group will have invested over one billion euros at the site since the project’s launch in 2022 to expand its development and production expertise for electric drive systems. Thanks to the increase in capacity, the plant will retain its status as the BMW Group’s leading facility for drive systems. The plant has been developing and building combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands for over 40 years. Plant Steyr’s many years of experience and high level of expertise in the field of drive systems make it the ideal site for manufacturing the Gen6 electric motors. Diesel and petrol engines continue to be manufactured there alongside the electric motors. By 2030, around half of the on-site employees should be working in electric mobility – a vital step for safeguarding the more than 4,700 jobs at the plant in the long term. In future, all key components of the innovative, highly integrated electric drive unit – i.e. the rotor, stator, transmission, inverter and housing – will be produced at Steyr. This will include manufacturing the inverters in an in-house clean room environment for the first time, thereby taking the engine plant into the realm of electrical engineering. The electric drive components will be built on two new assembly lines at Steyr.\n\nThermal management: complex interaction, crucial for performanceThermal management involves highly complex interaction between various systems in an electric vehicle and is of critical importance for a host of performance parameters, including range, real-world consumption, acceleration and charging time. Thermal management is a question of constantly keeping the temperature of the electric motor, power electronics and high-voltage battery in the optimum range, while maintaining standards of passenger comfort at the same time. Efficient thermal management is important for fast charging too. Here, the battery temperature must be kept within a defined window in order to make optimum use of the available charging capacity. Unlike combustion engines, electric motors give off little heat. This means that, depending on the operating state, the battery and the passenger cell have to be not only cooled, but heated too. The Steyr site develops the thermal management systems for all electric vehicles from the BMW Group. The plant’s development centre is also responsible for the brain at the heart of the electric motor – the inverter.\n\nBMW Group Plant Landshut – a multi-talented component manufacturer\n\nBMW Group Plant Landshut is the BMW Group’s largest component plant anywhere in the world, supplying components to all the company’s vehicle and drive system plants. Its workforce of around 3,700 employees produces a broad spectrum of cutting-edge components for vehicles from the BMW Group. Working closely with the BMW Group’s Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich, Plant Landshut plays a pivotal role as a hub of innovation for the automotive industry. It develops pioneering technologies and manufacturing processes that serve to maintain the company’s competitive edge. Over the course of the Neue Klasse project, the site is investing some €200 million in its light metal foundry to increase annual production capacity for the electric motor housings. The Injector Casting (ICA) process developed and patented in Landshut is a prime example of the plant’s innovative strength. This globally unique process is used to manufacture the electric motors’ highly complex aluminium housings that set new standards for lightweight design and functional integration.\n\nIn the event of enquiries please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nSpokesperson Production Network, Powertrain and High-voltage Batteries\n\nMobile: +49-151-601-79158\n\nSpokesperson BMW Group Plant Landshut\n\nMobile: +49-151-601-90340\n\nTeam Lead Purchasing and Supplier Network, Spokesperson Dr Joachim Post\n\nMobile: +49-151-601-62847\n\nSpokesperson Drive Technology, Battery, Charging, Efficient Dynamics\n\nMobile: +49-176-601-28556\n\nSpokesperson Sustainability\n\nMobile: +49-151-601-38407\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide.

The BMW Group has acquired two zero-emission fuel cell trucks, as it launches a pilot operation as part of the European H2Haul project, which is aimed at promoting hydrogen mobility in freight transport. The two vehicles will run between Leipzig, Landsberg and Nuremberg, in order to trial the practicality of this technology. To allow serial operation, two state-of-the-art hydrogen fuelling stations are being built in Leipzig and Hormersdorf. They allow rapid refuelling with large quantities of hydrogen, which is crucial to the continuous use of fuel cell trucks in the logistics sector. The BMW Group is implementing the H2Haul project in cooperation with Iveco, DHL and TEAL Mobility.\n\n“In global logistics, it is important to select the right means of transport, in order to operate in a future-oriented and efficient manner. To this end, the openness to technology in the BMW Group is also reflected in its transport logistics. For the first time, hydrogen-powered trucks will now be used in serial operation for German automobile production. We have been working with our partners for several years to implement this pilot fleet. This project is an important milestone as we gain experience in serial operation and continue to advance this important technology,” says Michael Nikolaides, Head of Production Network and Logistics BMW Group.\n\nTwo of 16 trucks subsidised in Europe will drive for BMW Group Logistics\n\nThe aim of the H2Haul project is to test hydrogen trucks with fuel cell drivetrains under realistic conditions, and to investigate the important contribution they can make to decarbonising heavy traffic. Testing this technology will pave the way for the commercialisation of fuel cell trucks in Europe. Funded by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, a total of 16 trucks will run in various European countries, including two IVECO S-eWay Fuel Cell trucks operated within Germany by BMW Group Logistics. The findings of the BMW Group when running the two trucks will help develop the technology to market maturity and pave the way for a wide-scale introduction in the road freight sector. Short refuelling times and longer ranges mean hydrogen trucks can represent an important addition to E-trucks, which are also in use at the BMW Group, on long routes. Another attribute worth emphasising is the flexible logistical operation of H2 trucks, without having to put a charging infrastructure in place or expand a network.\n\nBMW Group Strategy for Reduced Logistics Emissions\n\nParticipation in the H2Haul project, with the practical use of hydrogen fuel cell trucks in long-distance and heavy transport, is part of the BMW Group Strategy for Reduced Logistics Emissions and an important step towards achieving the BMW Group’s own climate goals on the road to zero-emission transport logistics. The cross-departmental “Reduced Logistics Emissions” team develops concepts to reduce CO2 across all global BMW Group transport, whether by road, rail or ship. The team evaluates drive technologies, taking into consideration different future scenarios, with the goal being to make transport within the global production and distribution network zero-emission. Positive assessments lead to the implementation of pilot projects and the development of plant concepts, the emission data from which is then consolidated in order to allow a CO2 report.\n\nAdditional use of H2 combustion engine trucks within the HyCET project\n\nAs well as participating in the H2Haul project, the HyCET project to test trucks with H2 combustion engines was also launched under the consortium leadership of the BMW Group. As part of the HyCET project, two 40-ton trucks and one 18-ton truck will be used in BMW Group Logistics in the future. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV). Affiliated partners in this project are DHL, Volvo Trucks, Deutz, KEYOU and TotalEnergies. By testing H2 fuel cells and H2 combustion engines at the same time, the BMW Group is also consistently following its approach to technological openness in the transport logistics sector. Compared to fuel cells, the combustion engine does have higher consumption. However, the similarity to the established diesel engine means it costs less to produce. The particularly low level of emissions produced by burning hydrogen means the H2 combustion trucks are classed as zero-emission vehicles in accordance with EU regulations. Both H2 fuel cell trucks and trucks with H2 combustion engines are used on the same BMW Group Logistics route and will use the same fuel stations. Comparing the two drive technologies will determine the best possible areas of application for the respective technology within BMW Group Logistics.\n\nHydrogen vehicles also used in intralogistics in Leipzig\n\nWithin the BMW Group, the Leipzig plant has for years played a pioneering role in the use of hydrogen in logistics. In 2013, the first indoor hydrogen fuel station in Germany was built on the grounds of the plant in Leipzig. Forklifts and tugger trains for internal plant logistics can be refuelled there. Over ten years later, the Leipzig plant possesses one of the largest fleets in Europe, with over 200 fuel cell-powered industrial trucks. Nowadays, five hydrogen fuel stations are located on the grounds of the plant, the newest of which allows fully-automated refuelling for the first time.\n\nUse of flexible hydrogen burners in the paintshop\n\nFirst hydrogen-powered BMW production model in 2028\n\nAs part of its holistic approach and after the successful global testing of the pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles, it is now preparing to start the series production of vehicles with hydrogen drivetrain in 2028. The series production models will be integrated into BMW’s existing portfolio, i.e. BMW will offer an existing model in an additional hydrogen fuel cell drive system variant. As fuel cell technology is another electric vehicle technology, the BMW Group explicitly views it as complementing the drive technology used by battery electric vehicles (BEV) and next to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and internal combustion engines (ICE)."}

The BMW Startup Garage is celebrating its tenth anniversary. Its achievements so far: 4,700 startups assessed, joint projects with more than 220 fledgling companies from 26 countries, and a total of 30 startups now established as suppliers, service providers and an integral part of the BMW Group network.\n\nThe BMW Group’s venture client unit was founded in February 2015. The aim was to provide support for startups that could significantly benefit the company’s products, services and processes. But what’s special about this type of collaboration is that the business founders get to keep their stake in their company, as the BMW Group is involved not as an investor but as their client – a venture client. It assesses and accelerates their development with a view to making them suppliers and long-term partners.\n\n“For the BMW Group, integrating innovative startups for a specific purpose is crucially important,” says Robert Hein, Head of the BMW Startup Garage, summing up his team’s first ten years of work. “We benefit from new ideas and perspectives we get from the collaboration and from the dynamism and agility of the startups. This allows us to make focused contributions to strong innovation development at the BMW Group.” But the startups themselves also reap the rewards: they have the backing of a strong partner who supports them as they develop their technologies and business models, and smooths the way for them to enter the automotive industry.\n\n“In our anniversary year, we are going to continue our successful work and develop our global focus even further,” Hein announced. “We’re on the lookout across the globe for innovative startups working closely on future mobility.” Emerging companies can apply for a place on the venture client programme at any time via bmwstartupgarage.com.\n\nBorn in Garching, at home around the world\n\nThe BMW Startup Garage was launched in 2015 in Garching, just outside the city of Munich. Today it operates offices in Mountain View, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Tel Aviv and, since 2024, Greenville (USA). 18 employees currently work in the global BMW Startup Garage network which, in combination with the venture capital arm BMW i Ventures, forms the startup ecosystem of the BMW Group. BMW i Ventures is based in Silicon Valley and Munich and invests in emerging startups with a formative influence on the future of the automotive industry, production and the supply chain.\n\nFrom startup to BMW Group logistics partner. The Embotech success story\n\nOne example of how close collaboration between the BMW Startup Garage and a fledgling business can lead to a lasting cooperation is Embotech AG. The Swiss-based company developed a solution known as automated vehicle marshalling (AVM), which allows vehicles to move around BMW plant premises automatically. AVM is now an integral part of the BMW Group’s state-of-the-art production logistics, and Embotech – supported by the BMW Group since 2018 – is an established global logistics partner in which BMW i Ventures has held a stake since December 2024."}

After three of Germany’s top players – Stephan Jäger, Martin Kaymer and Matti Schmid – confirmed their spots in the 2025 BMW International Open in December, two international stars have now also been announced, namely the two Masters champions Sergio García (2017) and Patrick Reed (2018). García will tee off at Germany’s only current DP World Tour tournament for the 14th time this year, while Reed is making only his second appearance in Munich.\n\nThe two exceptional golfers have also made their mark in the Ryder Cup. With 28.5 points, the 45-year-old Spaniard is the most successful player in the history of the legendary team competition, while the 34-year-old American earned himself the nickname ‘Captain America’ as the emotive leader of Team USA. Reed’s singles match against Rory McIlroy (NIR) at the 2016 Ryder Cup in Hazeltine (USA) is unforgettable and is regarded as the best one ever played in the competition to date.\n\nGarcía last teed off at the BMW International Open in 2022. Despite an extremely successful career with 16 titles on the DP World Tour and eleven wins on the PGA TOUR, he is yet to win in Munich. He has finished second twice (2011 and 2017) and, together with Pablo Larrazábal, became one of the sporting highlights of the tournament's 36-year history in 2011. Over five extra holes, the two Spaniards went head-to-head in a play-off that was both dramatic and top class, and one that those who had the privilege of witnessing live will no doubt never forget.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to returning to the BMW International Open. This tournament and the golf fans, who have always given me their whole-hearted support there, have always meant a great deal to me,” said García. “I love Munich and am looking forward to competing with a first-class international field, particularly the top German players.”\n\nReed made his debut at the BMW International Open last year and finished in joint 13thplace. After three rounds the Texan was just two shots behind the leader but was unable to exploit that good starting point on the final Sunday. However, Reed still has very fond memories of the week in Munich.\n\n“I am so excited to announce that I will be back in Munich this summer to tee it up in the 2025 BMW International Open. I played in the historic BMW International for the first time last year, and we had such a great time – the competitive spirit and atmosphere, the Bavarian culture, and crowd makes for such a great event! I look forward to coming back and experiencing that again this year,” said Reed. “I love to play courses with a lot of history, with great winners from both sides of the pond, that truly gives players a proper and fair test. Like all BMW events, this tournament is rich in tradition with outstanding organizations that support this great event and great fans who love great golf! BMW, The DP World Tour, and the tournament staff, make this event so special. We can’t wait to be back!”\n\nTickets for the BMW International Open are available to buy online in the ticket shop ( Entry to the Pro-Am tournament (Wednesday, 2nd July 2025) is free.

Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Group’s mission with its new high-performance test vehicle – the #BMW Vision Driving Experience. This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse – the next generation of BMW vehicles – and referred to by BMW as the #Heart of Joy. The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension – BMW’s hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure – to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.\n\n“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”\n\nThe Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.\n\nEnergy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range. By contrast, conventional systems have separate control algorithms for the drive system and brakes. This means the full handling potential of vehicles with powerful electric drive systems cannot be fully exploited.\n\nThe driver and passengers here experience a harmonious and noiseless driving feeling – regardless of the situation and speed they are travelling at. In dynamic driving scenarios, the new Heart of Joy / BMW Dynamic Performance Control combination serves up cornering poise and assurance beyond compare. The car generates impressive traction and can be threaded through corners with exceptional precision. Fewer control inputs are required and the car’s line can be maintained with greater precision and stability. This helps the car to develop consistent, reproducible cornering behaviour and allows it to be steered more intuitively and smoothly. At low speeds – such as in stop-start driving or when parking – direct signal transmissions and rapid information processing ensure an even more compelling driving experience. In driving modes D or B, or when using Active Cruise Control, the parking brake or parking lock, stopping and restarting merge seamlessly into one another.\n\nFurthermore, integrated drivetrain, braking and energy recuperation control allows energy to be used more sustainably. 98 per cent of drivers do not need to make any inputs using the conventional brakes. The braking power generated using energy recuperation is sufficient for normal, everyday driving. Only under heavy braking, e.g. in an emergency situation, is intervention required from the friction brakes. All in all, this system increases efficiency by up to 25 per cent.\n\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience test vehicle demonstrates how the Heart of Joy works using illuminating colour codes on the wheel rims: acceleration is indicated in green, energy recuperation in blue and braking using the friction brakes in orange.\n\nFour totally new super-brains will go to work in the BMW of the future. These high-performance computers cleverly combine various elements that previously ran separately. The Heart of Joy was developed 100 percent within the company. It allows four important control units to be brought together within a single high-performance computer.\n\nAnother three super-brains are responsible for features including automated and highly automated driving, infotainment and basic functions such as climate control and comfort-enhancing systems, vehicle access, interior and exterior lighting.\n\nThe BMW Vision Driving Experience will celebrate its official world premiere at #Auto Shanghai 2025."}

The latest version of the BMW X3 is poised for market launch in China. The country’s most successful Sports Activity Vehicle will arrive at Chinese dealerships in just a few days and will go on sale later in February 2025.\n\nDrive system: two petrol engines to choose from.\n\nThis exclusive version of the BMW X3 was developed and will be produced specifically for the Chinese market to meet the exacting expectations of customers in the high-growth SAV segment. The outgoing model was the strongest-selling BMW vehicle worldwide in 2023. 156,000 units were delivered in China alone – accounting for around 40 per cent of all BMW X model sales in the region.\n\nThe new BMW X3 will be launched in China with two engine variants. Customers can choose from a pair of four-cylinder petrol engines: the BMW X3 xDrive 25L Luxury develops 140 kW (190 hp) and maximum torque of 310 Nm (229 lb-ft). This is enough to accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.7 seconds on the way to a top speed of 214 km/h (133 mph). The even more dynamic BMW X3 xDrive 30L – available in the equipment variants Pioneering MSP and Exclusive MSP – generates 190 kW (258 hp) and peak torque of 400 Nm (295 lb-ft), and sprints from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 6.5 seconds. Top speed is 239 km/h (148 mph).\n\nLonger wheelbase, more space, more comfort.Alongside its BMW-typical sporting ability, the new SAV for the premium midsize class majors on high quality and comfort. For the first time, the version of the BMW X3 produced in China for China has an extended wheelbase. Yet it also retains the 50:50 weight distribution for which BMW is renowned, which results in almost perfect balance and therefore top-class handling. In addition, the 111-millimetre-longer wheelbase ensures even smoother and even more stable driving characteristics. And once inside, passengers can enjoy a significantly enhanced feeling of space.\n\nThis extra spaciousness is particularly noticeable in the rear compartment. Here, kneeroom has increased by a full 96 millimetres and legroom to over a metre. The new BMW X3 with extended wheelbase is 126 millimetres longer than the predecessor model and 25 millimetres wider. Its exterior length of 4,865 millimetres and width of 1,920 millimetres also mean it has the largest dimensions of any vehicle in its segment. However, it still has the hallmark proportions of a BMW X model, complete with a long roofline flowing smoothly into the rear end and a dynamically stretched silhouette.\n\nGenerous and exclusive equipment with a host of highlights. The luxurious driving experience is complemented by the high-quality and exclusive specification of the new BMW X3. Playing a prominent role here are the standard features enhanced by an array of market-specific details. Thanks to the new BMW iDrive based on BMW Operating System 9, customers in China benefit from a large number of exclusive digital services. The content of the BMW Digital Premium offering has been adapted precisely to the particular requirements and demands of customers in the Chinese market.\n\nThe exterior also stars with exclusive details for the Chinese market. Both model variants come as standard with BMW Iconic Glow contour lighting, which shows off the BMW kidney grille to eye-catching effect. The range of colour shades available comprises five exquisite metallic paint finishes, including a particularly striking Frozen variant that gives the car a visually impactful presence.\n\nFrom China, for China: local production brings many benefits.The two BMW X3 variants are tailored more keenly than ever to the preferences of discerning target groups in China. The vehicle concept, design, technology and equipment have all been adapted as required with no change to the prices asked for the predecessor model. BMW has also focused on its Shenyang base in China when it comes to development and production. The new BMW X3 models will be built at Plant Lydia, which BMW operates in tandem with its joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) and which employs cutting-edge, resource-conserving and efficient production methods. Local production also reduces transportation distances, optimises logistics and actively contributes to greater sustainability."}

Increasing efficiency through digitization: In a successful cooperation between BMW Group Plant Dingolfing and Landshut University of Applied Sciences, students have developed an innovative solution for plant logistics. The new digital tool automates the counting of empty containers using artificial intelligence (AI), saving time and avoiding errors.\n\nLooking for simple automation At the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, around 1,600 different types of containers are in circulation every day, transporting parts for vehicle production. Until now, these containers were counted manually, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. “Our goal was to automate empties counting as efficiently and simply as possible,” explains Wolfgang Schratzenstaller, project manager at the BMW Group Plant in Dingolfing.\n\nCooperation with Landshut University The idea of involving students from Landshut University of Applied Sciences in the project met with a positive response. “Students bring in new perspectives and unbiased approaches,” says Schratzenstaller. Prof. Dr. Abdelmajid Khelil, head of the IoT Innovation Lab at Landshut University, supported the project as part of a practical teaching module. The collaboration began with the summer semester 2024.\n\nMobile video instead of mental arithmetic\n\nWithin three months, the eight-person team developed a cost-effective and efficient solution. A simple mobile phone video, taken while running through the rows with the containers, is sufficient to determine the exact number per container variant. “QR codes are placed above the block storage lanes, which link to a database of container data. The AI analyses the video and calculates the number of containers,” explains Dominik Dama, an IT master's student.\n\nOutlook and development\n\nThe counting system is currently in the pilot phase to test its performance under real conditions. In the future, the solution will also be used in other areas of plant logistics. It is also planned to further automate the counting process by using autonomous Smart Transport Robots (STR) to record the videos."}

The event began with a parade of all MotoGP™ riders, led by the BMW M5 Touring MotoGP™ Safety Car. Another highlight of the event was a spectacular stage show, streamed live to fans worldwide and free to attend for everyone on site.\n\n“The MotoGP™ Season Launch in Bangkok was a fantastic event, and we are delighted to have been able to present our new BMW M5 Touring MotoGP™ Safety Car on such a great stage,” said Axel Mittler, Marketing Manager at BMW M Gmbh. “With this new Safety Car, we continue our commitment to bringing the latest technologies to MotoGP™ safety. Like the BMW M5 MotoGP™ Safety Car, the Touring variant is equipped with an M HYBRID powertrain, where a high-revving V8 engine is supported by an electric motor delivering instant power.

We take immense pride in our creative collaboration with the India Art Fair, as it continues to champion India's diverse and thriving contemporary arts landscape. Our shared vision for a future that is both creative and sustainable is perfectly encapsulated by the latest edition of 'The Future is Born of Art' Commission. This groundbreaking initiative explores how the harmonious integration of ecological and technological thinking can create a more sustainable, balanced, and regenerative world - all through the captivating lens of an artist's vision. We eagerly await the opportunity to welcome audiences from India and around the globe at the fair, where they will experience the transformative power of art and technology, united in the pursuit of a better tomorrow.\"\n\n‘The Future is Born of Art’ Commission‘The Future is Born of Art’ Commission, led by BMW India and India Art Fair is an annual commission designed to platform a promising young Indian artist on a global stage. Now in its fourth edition, the 2025 Commission invited emerging artists to propose an immersive installation centred around BMW iX1 LWB, MINI Countryman Electric and BMW Motorrad CE 02 and BMW Motorrad CE 04, reflecting on the theme of ‘Ecocentrism’. ‘Ecocentrism’ puts forward a worldview in which ecological and technological thinking coexist, imagining visions for a brighter, more sustainable future.\n\nAs winners of the prestigious ‘Future is Born of Art’ Commission, led by BMW and India Art Fair, Non-Linear (Dennis Peter) and Cursorama (Yash Chandak) join the ranks of India’s most promising artistic voices. The annual commission challenges emerging artists to create large-scale installations that explore topical themes built on shared values of BMW and India Art Fair. Previous winners, Sashikanth Thavudoz (2024), Devika Sundar (2023) and Faiza Hasan (2022), have set the stage with visionary works exploring community, materiality and ecology.\n\nNon-Linear and Cursorama’s winning project, Biolume, is an ambitious 180-degree multimedia experience inspired by bioluminescent organisms. With interactive screens that respond to audience movements, the installation creates a feedback loop between human actions and their immersive environment. The space is filled with original sound, ranging from serene melodies to glitchy soundscapes. The installation has three dynamic scenes:\n\nBiolume integrates generative design and biomimicry to place audiences inside an abstracted, glowing oceanic world. “Bioluminescence is nature’s sci-fi—a glowing, electric language that exists in harmony with its surroundings,” Peter explains. The project underscores the role of art as a tool for fostering ecological and social dialogue. “As artists, we see it as our responsibility to reflect on how technology and art can inspire change,” says the duo.\n\nBMW Art TalkOn the theme of ‘From Introspection to Impact: Artists Shaping the World’ a BMW Art Talk will be held on 7 February 2025 at the India Art Fair. This talk allows for a deeper introspection into the practices of artists by renowned artists Shirazeh Houshiary, Bharti Kher and Pushpamala N. with moderator Prof. Dr Thomas Girst, Head of Cultural Engagement, BMW Group. In a polarised world, artists allow us to see beyond the surface level – to think more deeply and be challenged, and to create spaces for kinship and solidarity across borders and generations. In keeping track of how the world has evolved, artists punctuate these moments with their art and bridge cultural ecosystems which is the DNA of BMW’s role in art and culture.\n\nBMW Group India Cultural EngagementThe BMW Group has initiated and been engaged in hundreds of global cultural initiatives for over 50 years. From music to film, from architecture to design, contemporary art has played an essential role – via long-term institutional partnerships with major museums or partnering with the leading art fairs around the world, such as Art Basel and Frieze from Los Angeles, New York and Miami, to Seoul, Hong kong, Paris, and London.\n\nSince its inception, BMW India has participated in leading cultural engagements across the country. In 2007, two BMW Art Cars embellished by world-renowned artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were presented at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai. BMW Art Car by Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Sandro Chia and Cesar Manrique have been exclusively showcased at various editions of the India Art Fair.\n\nSince its inception in 2012, BMW has partnered with Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the contemporary art exhibition, which brings international artists to India and creates a global platform for Indian artists. In 2012-13, the innovative BMW Guggenheim Lab came to India. Based at Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum and conducted at six different venues in Mumbai, the lab organised six weeks of free programmes with diverse audiences and communities addressing the challenges and conditions of the urban city.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}

It was our third attempt with the BMW M4 GT3, and after coming close last year, we finally made it! I am very happy for the Van der Linde brothers that they can celebrate a victory in their first race sharing a car for BMW M Motorsport. I am also pleased for Augusto Farfus, who can add another prestigious triumph to his illustrious career as a BMW M works driver. Valentino Rossi, Raffaele Marciello, and Charles Weerts also did a great job in the sister car. It's a pity that a penalty cost them a chance of victory. Team WRT remains undefeated this year after victories at the 24h Dubai and the 6h Abu Dhabi. Hopefully, this is a good omen for the rest of the season! Thank you to all the drivers, team members, and BMW M Motorsport employees who made this outstanding season start possible.”\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal Team WRT: “Three races, three wins. What an amazing start of the season! We tried to win at Bathurst with BMW M Motorsport for the last two years, but it never worked out. This time, everything was just spot on. This is a big race everyone wants to win, so I could not be happier. A special congrats goes to Kelvin van der Linde, who in only his second race with BMW M Motorsport achieved maybe his biggest win yet together with his brother. The #46 crew also did an excellent job coming back in the race and finishing just ten seconds behind.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “I am very, very happy! I think this victory was down to excellent execution of the guys at Team WRT. I don’t think I have ever seen such a perfet execution in terms of strategy before. We did not have the outright fastest car today, but still we did it! Both my teammates didn’t make any mistakes. Sharing this win with my brother for the first time since 2018, is very special of course. I’m really impressed how quickly he is up there with his pace in just his second race with BMW M Motorsport.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “This was a race with a crazy amount of emotions for me. First race back with Team WRT, first race back with my brother, first race with Augusto, second race for BMW m Motorsport. This is all very special. I don’t have to explain, what this win means for my brother and myself. I’m sure, mom and dad are proud at home. It’s also amazing for me to share this victory with Augusto, whom I looked up to when I was a kid. He was one of my heroes. Looking at the race, the final stint was very tough, as I had to hit fuel numbers and had Chaz Mostert behind me catching up. But in the end, it worked out perfectly.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#32 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “I’m a very lucky guy to be with BMW M Motorsport for such a long time. We came here many times and never were lucky enough to win. This time, we thought we had a chance – and we executed a perfect race. To put my name in the history books of this event now is very emotional. During the final 40 minutes we just hoped for a green end, as a safety car would have ruined our race. Luckily it all went well in the end. Thanks a lot to BMW M Motorsport, Team WRT and my teammates who did a perfect job.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “This podium is a fantastic way to start the season. The whole weekend was great, as we were always strong and competitive. We were able to fight with our sister car until I made a mistake unfortunately and we had to serve a drive-through penalty. I tought at that point, that the fight for the podium was over. But we managed to come back with great pace. Raffaele’s pass against Jules Gounon was a lot of fun to watch. I am very happy with the result.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “A 1-2 is a great result for the team. I know they have tried to win it for a long time, and now it finally worked out. Not for me personally, so I will still have to wait for my first victory here after a couple of podium finishes. It was a good fight with Jules Gounon. I knew I had the faster car on the straights, and when there was a slower car in front of us, I took the opportunity and attacked him. It was a good move. ”\n\nCharles Weerts (#46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “Huge congrats to our sister car. They were really quick all week and really deserve this win. For BMW M Motorsport it has been a long time trying to win here, so this 1-2 is pretty big for them and also for the entire Team WRT. Their strategy was absolute masterclass today. The overall result is great, but next time I hope we can swap positions.”\n\nAll figures relating to performance, fuel consumption, emissions and range are provisional.\n\nAll of the stated equipment features, technical data and fuel consumption and emissions figures relate to the\n\noffering in the German market."}

In the countdown to the start of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship, BMW Motorrad Motorsport has completed an intensive double test session. Last week, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team hit the track in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, with Michael van der Mark (NED). This week, at the two-day test in Portimão, Portugal, reigning World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) also joined the team after skipping Jerez due to a finger injury.\n\nIn addition to poor weather conditions, changed regulations complicated the development process. Due to the FIM rule change effective January 23, 2025, against BMW, the Super-Concession frame used last year may no longer be deployed. Furthermore, the fuel flow limit of 47 kg/h forces all teams to adopt more efficient strategies. However, it wasn't just the technology that was tested – World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu battled with a broken finger yet still managed impressive lap times, while Michael van der Mark had to regain his form after a crash at Jerez. Despite all these challenges, BMW has created a strong foundation with the new M 1000 RR – the season can begin!\n\nThe BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team was also in action at both tests, with Sylvain Guintoli (FRA) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) riding the new BMW M 1000 RR. The test days were used for intensive set-up work on the new World Superbike, with close collaboration between the race and test teams in preparation for the title defense mission. The 2025 WorldSBK season kicks off from 21st to 23rd February in Phillip Island (AUS), with another two-day test scheduled there beforehand.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “To sum it up briefly, we are ready for Phillip Island. It was certainly not the easiest winter, especially with the rainy days and the limited dry track time. Nevertheless, on the first day at Portimão, we were able to show well where we stand. We are also very happy that Toprak’s injury is healing. He’s not at 100% yet, but he has already proved on track what potential he and the BMW will have this year again. On Mickey’s side, we were also very positive. His performance has remained strong over the winter, and we saw in Jerez that he will carry this momentum into Phillip Island. Now, we can hardly wait to head to Australia and start the first race.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It is always a pleasure to see the factory team and the test team together at the track, experiencing how the respective technicians and riders synchronise, exchange information, and collaboratively develop the 2025 bike. The test team has tested in all weather conditions, laid solid foundations, and secured and confirmed the final parts for the 2025 race deployment. Markus and Sylvain have diligently completed laps and all test assignments, even though Sylvain was slightly unwell at Portimão. Wishing him a speedy recovery at this point. The race team also maximised a dry day at Jerez with Michael and a few dry but very windy hours at Portimão on Day 1 with both deployment riders. Toprak confirmed the competitiveness of the bike for 2025 on race tyres in dry conditions and admirably completed his test programme despite his hand injury, totalling 60 valuable laps. During the two test events in Jerez and Portimão, we were thus able to confirm the performance of the M1000RR in dry conditions, sort out components, and adapt the bike to the new regulations for 2025. The bike, riders and technical crew are ready and highly motivated to start their journey with the new M1000RR to Australia, where two valuable test days await before the first race of the season to incorporate the final insights from the pre-season tests and complete the fine-tuning.”\n\nShaun Muir, Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At Jerez we obviously only tested with Michael and we’ve been happy with the situation with him in terms of the work he’s done with the test items. We’re really happy with the package so far. At Portimão we were mostly struggling to work around the weather situation, so what turned out to be very valuable track time was on day one in the afternoon. We certainly ticked a lot of boxes in terms of understanding the package now. For sure not knowing that day two would be so bad weather wise, at least now we have some clear direction going to Phillip Island, where we have a more comfortable feeling now starting the season there.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “For me the test in Portimão, especially the first day, was really positive. We tried some new parts and set-ups and it worked really well. I’m happy and it looks like that we’re ready for the Phillip Island race. The test was also very important for me after my injury; my finger was broken and I couldn’t ride a bike for almost two months, so I’m glad that I could ride the Superbike again. I have still a little pain in my finger but on the bike I’m feeling very good. The hard braking especially is good and normal, it’s only while I’m leaning in the right corner, I’m not feeling a hundred percent comfortable and I’m not pushing as hard as before. I hope that it will be better by Phillip Island because generally everything is going really well. I’m looking forward to the Phillip Island test now, I hope we can find a good set-up and to start the season strong.”\n\nMichael van der Mark (ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It was really nice to be back at the track after the winter break. We were just really unlucky with the weather during the two tests at Jerez and Portimão. Anyway, I think we started off on a very good level. For sure you always want to try new things on a bike, especially with a new bike as we have, but the level was already so good, so I’m feeling very confident and am looking forward to Phillip Island. We have another two days of testing there, so there will be still a lot of things that we want to try but we know that the basis is really good and we’re happy to race now. The new bike feels really similar to last years bike, but with certain improvements, which is really good, I like it a lot.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger (BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team): “Unfortunately, we didn't have the best weather during the pre-season tests, but that was the case for all teams and riders. The weather was quite mixed at both tests, and also relatively cool. Nevertheless, we tried our best to complete our test programme and rode many laps. We tried out various things and the engineers were satisfied with that. As a test rider, it's also important for me to contribute insights that the engineers and the team can work with effectively and that actually benefit the project, so my goal isn't necessarily to ride a fast lap. All in all, the tests were cool, we spent a lot of time together and collected a lot of data. I think we've done a good job preparing, so that the factory team now has a good base for Phillip Island, and I am very happy and grateful to be a part of it.”\n\nSylvain Guintoli (BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team): “I’m actually not feeling very well, so I only tested the first day at Portimão. I still managed to do more than 70 laps though but couldn’t test on day two. Anyways, in general the winter testing was good, we definitely had challenging weather conditions at Jerez and Portimão, but we did what we wanted to do. We were able to cover lots of mileage in both wet and dry conditions, which was really important so it was definitely also good practice for our Endurance season, especially for Le Mans. All in all we got everything done and I’m really happy with it. It feels good, that everything is now ready to go for the first round at Phillip Island. It was great work by the test team and also by the factory team. Working together was a pleasure.”"}

The latest new addition to the manufacturer’s most popular range builds on the success of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive (fuel consumption combined: 10.4 l/100 km [27.2 mpg ...", "tags": ["G81", "BMW M Cars", "Touring"], "url": "https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0447610EN/the-first-ever-bmw-m3-cs-touring:-racing-dna-meets-maximised-everyday-usability", "content": "The model-specific performance characteristics of the engine and power transfer via the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission and M xDrive all-wheel-drive system serve up dynamic thrills and supreme traction. The BMW M3 CS Touring races from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds.\n\nThe world premiere of the first-ever BMW M3 CS Touring will be hosted by the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, in the Australian state of New South Wales. The BMW M3 CS Touring will be revealed to the public for the first time on 30 January 2025 as part of the Bathurst 12 Hour race programme. Deliveries of the limited-run model to customers in Europe, Australia, Japan and South Korea, among others, will begin in March 2025. The car’s home market of Germany is by a distance its most important sales region. The special edition will be produced alongside all other variants of the BMW M3 Sedan and BMW M3 Touring at BMW Group Plant Munich.\n\nSix-cylinder in-line engine adapts racing-car technology.\n\nThe 3.0-litre six-cylinder in-line engine in the BMW M3 CS Touring was designed from the outset to deliver high performance on the race track – and it features a multitude of technological details from racing-car design. These include an extremely rigid crankcase with a sleeve-free, closed-deck construction, a forged lightweight crankshaft and a cylinder head with a 3D-printed core. The likewise weight-saving cylinder bores have a wire-arc sprayed iron coating to reduce frictional losses. The cooling system and oil supply are also designed to handle the sustained heavy loads generated during hard driving on a track.\n\nThe drive unit combines the high-revving characteristics for which M is renowned and linear power delivery into the upper reaches of the engine’s range with upgraded M TwinTurbo technology. Raising the maximum charge pressure of the two mono-scroll turbochargers to 2.1 bar and making model-specific tweaks to the engine management enable the maximum output of the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive to be increased by another 15 kW/20 hp to 405 kW/550 hp. The engine develops its peak torque of 650 Nm (479 lb-ft) between just 2,750 and 5,950 rpm, produces its maximum output at 6,250 rpm and tops out at 7,200 rpm.\n\nIn addition, a specially designed engine mounting with increased spring rates creates an extremely rigid connection between the power unit and the vehicle’s structure. This leads to even sharper engine response and extremely direct transmission of its power to the drivetrain. Its instantaneous power delivery means the BMW M3 CS Touring can power from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.5 seconds, and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) is over in 11.7 seconds. The figures recorded using the “one-foot rollout” method* are 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.2 seconds and 0 to 200 km/h (124 mph) in 11.4 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 2.7 seconds in 4th gear and 3.5 seconds in 5th gear. The top speed of the special-edition model – which comes as standard with the M Driver’s Package – is electronically limited to 300 km/h (186 mph).\n\nThe car’s emotionally stirring engine note is the work of the M-specific exhaust system featuring electrically controlled flaps, a titanium rear silencer with weight-minimising design and – in customary M fashion – two pairs of tailpipes painted in matt Black. The engine’s acoustic presence varies according to the engine profile the driver selects from the M Setup menu. SPORT or SPORT+ mode produces a drive sound that injects real aural drama into proceedings, particularly through gear changes and the accompanying adjustments in rev speed.\n\nEight-speed M Steptronic transmission, M xDrive and Active M Differential enable irresistibly dynamic power transfer.\n\nThe engine under the bonnet of the BMW M3 CS Touring teams up with an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission including Drivelogic. The Drivelogic button integrated into the gear selector lever makes it possible to alter the transmission’s shift characteristics, with a choice of three clearly distinguishable settings available. As well as comfort-focused and sporty options, drivers can also engage a setting optimised specially for track driving. Both the selector lever and the carbon-fibre shift paddles on the steering wheel enable sequential interventions in the gear selection process.\n\nThe BMW M3 CS Touring channels its power to the road through the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. This employs an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch in the transfer case to ensure fully variable and super-smooth distribution of the engine’s power between the front and rear wheels, and serves up tireless all-wheel-drive performance, even during hard track sessions. In tandem with the Active M Differential at the rear axle – whose operation is also fully variable – the intelligent all-wheel-drive system’s rear-wheel bias enhances the M-typical handling dynamics. Added to which, 4WD Sport mode can be selected via the M Setup menu. This sends an even greater proportion of the engine’s power to the rear wheels. 2WD mode, meanwhile, delivers a driving experience for the ultimate purist, laying on classical rear-wheel drive with the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system deactivated.\n\nModel-specific tuning for the chassis technology and performance-focused stopping power.\n\nThe chassis technology in the BMW M3 CS Touring has been tuned precisely to the engine’s performance characteristics, the overall vehicle concept and the specific weight distribution of this latest special-edition model. The settings for the DSC system and M Dynamic Mode have also been purposefully optimised for the specific demands of dynamically committed circuit driving. The electronically controlled dampers of the adaptive M suspension on the BMW M3 CS Touring likewise come in a model-specific setup, as do its M Servotronic steering and integrated braking system.\n\nProviding outstanding stopping power are M Compound brakes with callipers painted in a choice of Red or Black. There is also the option of M Carbon ceramic brakes whose brake callipers are available in Red or matt Gold. Also on the standard equipment list are forged M light-alloy wheels in an exclusive double-spoke design with a matt Gold Bronze or matt Black finish. Measuring 19 inches in diameter at the front axle and 20 inches at the rear, the wheels are fitted as standard with track tyres (275/35 ZR19 at the front, 285/30 ZR20 at the rear). As an alternative to these tyres, customers also have the no-cost option of sport tyres with the same dimensions. And ultra-track tyres are also included on the options list.\n\nExclusive carbon-fibre components and optimised body rigidity help to produce outstanding performance attributes.\n\nTogether with the extremely powerful engine and model-specific chassis technology, intelligent lightweight design measures also play a major part in moulding the exclusive performance attributes of the BMW M3 CS Touring. Extensive use of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) is particularly important when it comes to weight minimisation. The car’s bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes, exterior mirror caps and rear diffuser are all made from CFRP.\n\nInside the cabin, the M Carbon bucket seats and likewise CFRP steering wheel shift paddles, interior trim strips and centre console also do their bit to keep weight down. The various lightweight design measures bring about a total weight saving of some 15 kilograms over the BMW M3 Competition Touring with M xDrive. Body rigidity is further increased by specifying the optional M front end strut brace for the engine compartment that has also been engineered for lightness.\n\nExquisite balance of performance and everyday usability; exclusive design features.\n\nHallmark M performance and the versatility-focused body concept of a Touring model certainly make an unusual combination, and the latest special edition adds a special allure to the mix. In the BMW M3 CS Touring, a concentrated dose of M feeling meets a variable-usage interior whose storage capacity below the high-opening tailgate can be expanded from 500 litres to a maximum 1,510 litres. In addition, the dynamically stretched lines of the Touring model and the M-specific exterior details – crafted precisely to meet the technical demands of cooling air supply and aerodynamic balance – are complemented by exclusive design features whose striking appearance reflects the track-leaning instincts of the BMW M3 CS Touring.\n\nFor example, the standard-specification exposed carbon fibre of the special-edition’s bonnet, front splitter, front air intakes and M exterior mirror caps creates an eye-catching contrast against the visually striking exterior colours available for the rest of the car. The BMW M3 CS Touring can be ordered with a paint finish in British Racing Green, Laguna Seca Blue, Frozen Solid White or Sapphire Black metallic. The roof and model-specific roof spoiler are in Black high-gloss and bring an impression of elegance to the bold exterior. Another exclusive design feature of the special-edition model is the red surround for the roof spoiler.\n\nThe front end of the car is defined by the weight-minimised, ultra-stripped-back and frameless BMW M kidney grille. The black model lettering on the upper of the two horizontal grille slats is bordered by a red contour line, likewise the model badging at the front and rear. In a clear reference to motor sport, the LED headlights of the BMW M3 CS Touring glow with the same distinctive yellow light as GT racing cars.\n\nDriver-focused cockpit with exclusive racing-car aura.\n\nThe interior of the BMW M3 CS Touring blends a sports-car cockpit designed to exude maximum performance with digital technology and exclusive design features. Electrically adjustable and heated M Carbon bucket seats are fitted as standard for the driver and front passenger. They have integral head restraints, an illuminated “CS” model badge and surfaces in Merino leather. Their exclusive Black/Red design is also adopted by the rear seats, while all the door panel trim is covered with black leather.\n\nThe standard M Alcantara steering wheel in three-spoke design – with its flat-bottomed rim and red centre marker in the 12-o’clock position – brings authentic racing car flair into the cockpit,. Further M-specific details are the red “CS” badge on the centre console, M seat belts and door sill plates with model lettering.\n\nThe M-specific Setup button on the centre console enables direct access to the settings for the engine, chassis, steering, brakes and M xDrive. Two individually configurable setup variants can be stored together with personal settings for the engine sound, DSC, Automatic Start/Stop function and the shift characteristics of the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission – and these setups are then selected using the M buttons on the steering wheel. The BMW M3 CS Touring also comes as standard with the M Drive Professional system with track-optimised functions such as the M Drift Analyser and M Laptimer. Added to which, the 10-stage M Traction Control delivers personalised driving fun on the track. Another feature of M Drive Professional is the M Mode button on the centre console, which can be used to configure the driver assistance systems and the content shown on the information display and Head-Up Display. Drivers can choose between ROAD, SPORT and TRACK settings here.\n\nIn the new BMW M3 CS Touring, the latest version of the display and control/operation system BMW iDrive based on BMW Operating System 8.5 provides intuitive control of numerous vehicle functions and digital services. With the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and BMW Curved Display both on board, the car is based squarely on operation using touch control and natural language. The M-specific view on the 12.3-inch information display shows the familiar M Shift Lights at its upper edge, while the status of the driving stability systems, M xDrive and traction control can be found at the lower edge of the screen. The home screen of the 14.9-inch control display includes widgets for the vehicle setup, tire pressure and temperature.\n\nSophisticated options for enhancing driving pleasure and comfort in everyday use.\n\nStandard specification for the BMW M3 CS Touring also includes BMW Live Cockpit Professional which, alongside the BMW Head-Up Display with M-specific content, brings the cloud-based navigation system BMW Maps, smartphone integration, telephony with wireless charging and a WiFi interface. The BMW Drive Recorder can be added as an option.\n\nThe BMW M3 CS Touring additionally offers customers a selection of comfort-enhancing features and driver assistance systems composed with the focus firmly on the enjoyment of unadulterated driving pleasure. Comfort Access, the alarm system, two-zone automatic climate control and the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System are all fitted as standard. Park Distance Control and the Parking Assistant, Front Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning and the Speed Limit Info system are likewise standard, while the Driving Assistant system can be specified as an option.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP combined: Energy consumption 10.5 l/100km; CO2 emissions 238 g/km; CO2 class G."}

The new edition of the Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV), designed exclusively for all-electric driving, underlines its claim to leadership with an increase in driving performance combined with a significantly extended range. The new BMW iX now achieves a WLTP range of up to 701 kilometres (435 miles), which is outstanding in the competitive environment. It is yet another fascinating example of the effectiveness of the BMW EfficientDynamics package of measures and technologies. Innovations in the field of BMW eDrive technology go hand in hand with specific exterior and interior design modifications that emphasise the sporty character of the new BMW iX.\n\nThanks to the consistent further development of the performance electronics and the fine-tuning of the wheel bearings and tyres, among other things, fuel consumption in the statutory WLTP test cycle has been improved by more than 8 per cent (best case scenario, depending on model and equipment). In the case of the new BMW iX xDrive60, this corresponds to an increase in range of around 60 kilometres (37 miles).\n\nNew model designations reflect the BMW iX's additional performance. It will be available from spring 2025 as the BMW iX xDrive45 (power consumption combined according to WLTP: 21.8 kWh/100 km (62 miles); CO2 class: A), the BMW iX xDrive60 (power consumption combined according to WLTP: 21.9 kWh/100 km (62 miles); CO2 class: A) and the BMW iX M70 xDrive (power consumption combined according to WLTP: 23.5 kWh/100 km (62 miles); CO2 class: A), worldwide. Key markets for the new BMW iX are the USA, UK and Germany. It will continue to be produced at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing. The BMW Group's largest production plant in Europe is the company's centre of competence for the production of electric drives and at the same time the lead plant for the premium and luxury class models.\n\nExterior: Striking presence, M Sport package as a new option.\n\nThe exterior of the new BMW iX has an expressive presence and monolithic appearance with characteristic SAV proportions, a design language reduced to the essentials and clearly defined surfaces. The striking front design is characterised in particular by the redesigned BMW radiator grille with a particularly filigree frame and a structure of vertical and diagonal lines in its interior. The BMW Iconic Glow kidney grille with contour lighting (standard for the new BMW iX M70 xDrive) is now available as a new option.\n\nThe headlights have also been redesigned with vertical elements for daytime running lights and turn indicators. The standard equipment of the new BMW iX includes adaptive LED headlights with cornering light function and new city lights. The structure of the BMW kidney grille is echoed in the diagonal lines of the headlight covers.\n\nThe front and rear aprons of the new BMW iX have an almost seamless design and a higher proportion of body-colour painted surfaces, giving them a sporty, elegant appearance as standard. The M Sport package, now available as an option for the all-electric SAV, emphasises the dynamic character of the vehicle with powerful lines, striking air intakes at the front and vertical reflectors at the rear.\n\nIn conjunction with the optionally available M Sport package Pro, the new BMW iX is equipped with dark M Shadow Line headlights and rear lights. The series' top model stands out even more than the other variants. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive comes as standard with the design features of the M Sport package and the M Sport package Pro, including a model-specific BMW kidney grille with M logo, black exterior mirror caps and exclusive 22-inch M light-alloy wheels.\n\nThe range also includes the new finishes Arctic Race Blue metallic, Dune Grey metallic, Carbon Black metallic, BMW Individual Frozen Deep Grey metallic, BMW Individual Frozen Pure Grey metallic, Tanzanite Blue metallic and Space Silver metallic (available from summer 2025). The BMW Individual Exterior Line Titanium Bronze is also available as a further option for the BMW iX xDrive45 and the BMW iX xDrive60.\n\nPerformance enhancement for all model variants.\n\nWith an electric motor on both the front and rear axle, all variants of the new BMW iX feature electric all-wheel drive. The drive system has been fine-tuned and the power electronics further developed to deliver noticeably more power. The new BMW iX xDrive45 delivers a system output that has been increased by 60 kW/82 hp to 300 kW/408 hp. The added power results in a 1.0 second improvement in acceleration from zero to 100 km/h (62 mph) to 5.1 seconds. The new BMW iX xDrive60 has a power output increase of 15 kW/21 hp to 400 kW/544 hp and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.6 seconds. Both models have an electronically limited top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph).\n\nMore than ever, the new BMW iX M70 xDrive offers particularly fascinating performance characteristics. The drive of the BMW M vehicle delivers 30 kW/40 hp up to 485 kW/659 hp in My Mode Sport and a maximum torque of 1,100 Nm (811 ft-lb), which is available when Launch Control is activated. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.8 seconds. Using the \"1-foot rollout\" method*, the time taken to sprint to 100 km/h (62 mph) is 3.5 seconds. The new BMW iX M70 xDrive reaches a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph).\n\nUnique in this segment: A range of up to 701 kilometres (435 miles).\n\nNew battery cell technology increases the energy content of the high-voltage battery for the BMW iX xDrive45 by around 30 per cent to 94.8 kWh. The high-voltage batteries of the other model variants provide a usable energy content of 109.1 kWh (BMW iX xDrive60) and 108.9 kWh (BMW iX M70 xDrive).\n\nIn addition, a new inverter technology for the power electronics of all model variants optimises the power density of the drive system. This ensures particularly high efficiency in the transfer of energy from the high-voltage battery to the electric motor. In combination with the higher energy content of the battery for the new BMW iX xDrive45 and other efficiency-enhancing measures for all variants, this results in a range increase of up to 40 per cent, depending on the model. With a WLTP range of 563 to 701 kilometres (350 to 435 miles), the new BMW iX xDrive60 sets a new benchmark in its competitive environment.

Electric drivetrain upgrades, new engine variants, as well as additional standard and optional equipment features will make the current BMW model range even more attractive and versatile in spring 2025. The use of new components for the power electronics and other measures designed to optimise efficiency have resulted in a considerably increased range for the all-electric BMW i5. Standard equipment on all BMW 5 Series models will soon include ambient lighting complete with a BMW Interaction Bar featuring a crystalline surface, lumbar support for both front seats as well as the Harman Kardon HiFi loudspeaker system.\n\nTwo new variants of the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé will become available in April 2025. The BMW X3 model range will likewise be expanded, with a powerful six-cylinder in-line diesel engine. Almost 50 per cent higher charging rates – that’s the news for the plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW X1, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, BMW 7 Series and the BMW XM models. With the BMW Digital Key Plus, owners can, depending on the type of mobile device, activate up to 18 digital vehicle keys with individually configured access permissions. The new tyre repair kit Plus will become part of the standard equipment for selected BMW models from March 2025. It enables owners to continue their journey even with a tyre puncture. Adaptive LED Headlights will become part of the standard equipment for the BMW X5 and BMW X6 models in spring 2025.\n\nBMW i5 and BMW i5 Touring now even more energy-efficient.\n\nFrom March 2025 the all-electric models of the BMW 5 Series Sedan and BMW 5 Series Touring will benefit from a number of technical advances that reduce their energy consumption. The result is a noticeably greater range, with an increase of up to 47 kilometres (depending on the model and equipment installed as part of an individual vehicle configuration). This owes much to the first ever use of silicon carbide semiconductor components in the power electronics (SiC converter) of the BMW i5 and to particularly low-rolling-resistance tyres fitted to aerodynamic alloy wheels. The optimised wheel bearings will also help save power.\n\nBMW Digital Key Plus as standard in the new BMW iX.\n\nIn the new BMW iX, the BMW Digital Key Plus will become the driver’s first choice for vehicle access from March 2025. The package also includes a physical key, a Setup Card and a Service Card. The new Setup Card makes installing the Digital Key Plus on a smartphone easier than ever. Users can simply hold the card close to their mobile device or scan the QR code on the back. Once activated, drivers can safely share the Digital Key Plus with others, using a simple text message. Depending on the mobile device, up to 18 digital keys can be activated soon. Different roles and permissions can be set for the vehicle when sharing the keys. For example, the vehicle’s acceleration and top speed can be limited – a particularly useful feature for novice drivers. Moreover, the BMW Digital Key Plus enables additional control functions from the vehicle’s vicinity, such as having the BMW iX enter or exit a parking space via the My BMW app. And if there ever is a need to hand over a physical key, for example for service visits or in the event of a breakdown, the new Service Card can be activated as a full-fledged key with a single click.\n\nOther digital improvements and enhancements.The popular YouTube* video app has been available for vehicles with BMW Operating System 9 since January 2025, provided the customer has activated BMW Digital Premium. Furthermore, the Personal eSIM in BMW Operating System 9 can now be activated for improved telephony and a WiFi hotspot in the vehicle. Vehicles with BMW Operating System 8.5 benefit from a more intuitive BMW Maps interface.\n\nTyre repair kit Plus: Remaining mobile the easy way.\n\nThe new tyre repair kit Plus, part of the standard equipment for selected BMW models from March 2025, enables customers to continue their journey even with a tyre puncture. This requires just a few simple steps that are explained in the vehicle’s Integrated Owner’s Handbook. The one-piece tyre repair kit includes a magnet and connector pin to secure it to the hub of the affected wheel. A hose then fills the tyre with air and aerosol sealant using an integrated compressor. Once a sufficient tyre pressure above 1.5 bar has been achieved, the journey can be continued, with the device safely attached to the wheel hub. Drivers can now\n\n* Not available in the countries/regions of Guadeloupe, Guam, Macedonia, Martinique, Montenegro, La Réunion, Saint-Martin.\n\ncover a range of up to 200 kilometres at a top speed of 80 km/h. This should easily get them to the nearest service centre. From spring 2025 the BMW X1, BMW X2, BMW iX and various models of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer will come with this equipment feature. The tyre repair kit Plus is also included with the models of the BMW 5 Series Sedan (except for models with standard 19-inch light alloy wheels Triplex-spoke style 933 Silver).\n\nBMW X5, BMW X6, BMW X7 and BMW M5: Added equipment. The comprehensive standard equipment on the BMW X5 and BMW X6 will from spring 2025 include adaptive matrix LED headlights. The BMW X7 will always come with the Parking Assistant Professional. Standard equipment for the M60i xDrive powertrain version of all three model series will also include the M Sport package Pro, the Harman Kardon surround sound system and sun protection glazing.\n\nThe BMW M5 will also benefit from more comprehensive equipment. Two new upholstery options are available to add special accents to the interior. In addition to BMW Individual Taupe Grey/Deep Lagoon Merino Leather, BMW Individual Black/Dark Violet Merino Leather is available as a new colourway. In all BMW M5 variants, as well as in all BMW 5 Series Sedan and BMW 5 Series Touring models, the trim and switches for the power windows, mirror adjustment and tailgate button are finished in high-gloss Black with a 3D effect as standard.\n\nNew light alloy wheels for BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and BMW X1.\n\n17-inch light alloy wheels Star-spoke style 875 will be available for various BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and BMW X1 models from March 2025.\n\nAt a glance: The new, spring 2025 BMW models*\n\nBMW 2 Series Gran Coupé\n\nFuel consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (l/100 km)\n\nBMW 223 xDrive Gran Coupé\n\nEnergy consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (kWh/100 km)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan\n\nEnergy consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (kWh/100 km)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Touring\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Touring\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring\n\nFuel consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (l/100 km)\n\n* All new models available with start of production in March or May 2025 (BMW X3).\n\nAll descriptions of model variants, equipment, technical data, consumption and emission values are for vehicles as offered on the German market.\n\nEnergy consumption and emission data refer to the German Passenger Car Energy Labelling Regulation (EnVKV).\n\nAll technical data are preliminary.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nCypselus von Frankenberg, Product Communication BMW Automobiles\n\nAlexandra Landers, Head of Product and Brand Communication BMW\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide.

For more than 23 hours, BMW M Team RLL and Paul Miller Racing had their sights set on victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), but a dramatic final stage dashed all hopes of a well-deserved reward for a great performance by BMW M Motorsport at the season opener of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). Dries Vanthoor (BEL), who had secured pole position in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, collided with a competitor while fighting for second place and fell to fourth place due to the subsequent repairs. A similar fate befell Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, who was also contending for the win but ultimately had to settle for fourth position in the GTD-PRO class after an incident.\n\nDespite the disappointment over the frustrating final stage of the race, BMW M Motorsport looks back on a very strong race weekend at Daytona. Both the BMW M Hybrid V8 and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO demonstrated their enormous potential and made a significant impact on the track. Vanthoor, starting as the lead driver for the #24 from pole position – the first for BMW M Motorsport's LMDh project – built a 25-second lead in his first double-stint. Although this was levelled by numerous yellow flag periods, it underscored the strength of the vehicle. The same applies to the fastest race lap, which Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) drove in 1:35.868 minutes in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 which also showed impressive speed but fell back due to several incidents, finishing in seventh place. Both BMW M Hybrid V8s had no technical issues.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Paul Miller Racing played several leading roles. The #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO led the race into the evening but was then hit by an opponent in a mass collision. The heavily damaged vehicle was repaired thanks to the great efforts of the mechanics but lost many laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth place. The sister #1 car stepped up, moved up from its 13th starting position, and fought for the win until just before the end. Kelvin van der Linde had the podium in sight at his race debut for BMW M Motorsport until he was forced into a spin by an opponent and fell back to fourth place. In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport also gave a strong performance, finishing the race with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in fifth place.\n\nYou can find video interviews with BMW M Motorsport head Andreas Roos and the BMW M factory drivers, as well as footage from Daytona for editorial use at the following link: \n\nComments after the 24h Daytona:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"Of course we had hoped for a different outcome of the Daytona weekend. With 50 minutes left, we were in the fight for the win in all categories. Everyone could see how fast and reliable our car is. The drivers and the teams did a great job and made no mistakes. But that's racing.\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “A big thank you to the entire team. Unfortunately, we had a weekend of ups and downs. If we only look at the race results, we cannot be satisfied with the fourth places in the GTP and GTD PRO classes. We started the weekend well, achieving very good results in both the free practice sessions and in qualifying – with Dries Vanthoor on pole position (GTP) and Dan Harper in third place (GTD PRO). That was very promising. For much of the race, we were able to compete for class victories and even the overall win. That's the positive we want to take with us. When you fight for the top positions in a 24-hour race for so long though, it is ultimately sad and disappointing for the teams and drivers who have invested a lot of work to get there - it would have been deserved to win at least one, if not the winner's trophy. Nevertheless, we must take the positives: the strong trend from 2024 clearly continues, we were able to build on it and field a competitive car in the GTP class here. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also shown in its third race that it can compete against the toughest competition – also in IMSA.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “I want to say a massive congratulations to my brother. If there is someone who should win the race if it is not me then it is my brother. He has had a good time in the last couple of races and seasons and I am very happy for him. I for sure am very gutted with this result. We showed a great pace and that the car is capable of doing it. Obviously finishing in P4 in a 24 hour race is not the end of the world, but at the end of the day it is very sad to fight for 22 hours and not come home with a podium, which we for sure deserved. I feel sorry for the guys, who have been working very hard and also to my teammates. I would have loved to gift them with something, but most important is that we showed that we were strong and able to fight. We will make sure to come back and we will win this race.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 7th place): “It was a very disappointing ending to the race for us. We had a very good package to fight for the win, which we showed all week long so we were quite positive heading into the race. Unfortunately we had a small issue in the pit stop with the brake change. That cost us three laps and we never really manage to make it back again. Obviously that was not the reward we wanted to give all the guys for the hard work all over the winter trying to make sure we have a fast car that is able to fight for the win. But we will definitely take a lot of notes from the race weekend, try to improve for Sebring and really bring that podium home.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 4th place GTD PRO): “It is a proud moment for me, fighting the whole race for the win. It was a good mileage for me, learning the car for the first time. To narrowly have missed out on the win is more than I could have ever expected. It was unfortunate as we led the race for the last two hours. The last pit stop was where we unfortunately lost track position and we weren’t really able to overtake looking forward. The rest is history. We will come back and try again next time.”\n\nMax Hesse (# 48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO):\n\n“First of all, I would like to express a huge thank you to BMW M Motorsport and Paul Miller Racing. It was the first time I was able to start here. It's a very cool event and it remains my dream to win here someday. This year, we definitely had the package to do it. Unfortunately, we were involved in a big crash, which was not our fault. I was very well warned by my team, but unfortunately, our competitors behind us were not. That's part of it. Our car ran great. The mechanics did a top job getting us back on track. I think we've gained good experience for Sebring - and there we'll try to go full attack again.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO): “The situation with the Corvette and our sister car was very difficult. My intention was to support my teammate in the sister car in the fight for victory. I was aware that it was hard racing. The situation that led to the collision between the Corvette and Connor De Phillippi behind me was very unfortunate – but I had nothing to do with it directly. I stayed on my inside line.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT 3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 5th place GTD):\n\n“Looking solely at the result, fifth place for Turner Motorsport was the best 24-hour race at Daytona. On the other hand, we entered to win. Therefore, we are very frustrated. Half an hour before the end of the race, we were in second place and had done many things right up to that point. When you then finish in fifth place, at first glance you tend to see the negatives, but we gave it our all, and that was the maximum we could achieve with the overall package. I am still proud that after the BMW M4 GT3 was already capable of winning in its first two dress rehearsals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we also had the cars in the lead for a long time here and once again proved that the car has the potential to win races. This gives me a positive outlook; we will take this experience home, continue working, and then I think it will still be a very successful season.”"}

We have refined the design style, added numerous improvements in terms of detail and comfort and made the R 18 even more fun to ride with the18-inch rear wheel. In addition to new finishes and equipment, theBMW R 18 Roctane, R 18 B and R 18 Transcontinental have also undergone a technical revision to bring the entire BMW R 18 range into line with the EU 5+ standard.”Markus Lederer, Head of Boxer Series\n\nMunich. BMW Motorrad entered the cruiser segment in 2020 with the BMW R 18, followed in the same year by the R 18 Classic, a nostalgic touring bike. Finally, in 2021, the R 18 Transcontinental and the R 18 B were added to the Big Boxer Heritage series – a Grand American touring motorcycle for luxurious travel and a bagger for cool highway cruising. In 2023, the BMW R 18 Roctane became the fifth member of the fascinatingR 18 family, offering superior cruising and touring in custom bagger style ever since. For the 2025 model year, the R 18 models feature updates in terms of design, comfort and technology.\n\nOffering increased torque, the Big Boxer now complies with Euro 5+ in allBMW R 18 models.A revision of the engine control now ensures compliance with the Euro 5+ standard. The maximum torque of the 67 kW (91 hp) 1,802 cc Big Boxer has been increased by 5 Nm to 163 Nm at 3,000 rpm. From 2,000 to 4,000 rpm, more than 150 Nm of torque is available at any time – an absolutely superior source of riding pleasure.\n\nBMW R 18: custom cruiser staged in modern, dynamic style.As a cruiser, the revised BMW R 18 is now purist but also more contemporary. Featuring newly crafted designs for the front and rear wheel covers along with an 18-inch rear wheel (previously 16-inch) and a new wheel design featuring seven double spokes, the R 18 has a more dynamic appearance that goes even further in emphasising its authentic cruiser character. The wheels are also optionally available as Contrast Cut Wheels. Here, the cast aluminum wheels are given a glossy polish and then sealed with clear finish. The familiar 19”/16” spoked wheel combination is still available as an option.\n\nExtending over the entire length of the tank on the top, the sculpture of the iconic fuel tank is seamlessly continued at the rear fender and ends at the level of the BMW emblem. Having previously stylised the classic round arch, the front fender now has a much more modern and dynamic appearance due to a sculptural surface elevation. All three body components now look as if they have been cast from a single piece. The side cover perfectly matches this design style with its more marked side contour. The more modern styling is also reflected in the “rough look” of the fork section, the fork tubes now free and without classic fork sleeves.\n\nOther features that harmonise with the more dynamic design style are the new silencers with a circular cross-section and the newly designed individual seat with foam that is 10 mm thicker and with modified design contours. The significantly more comfortable seat is removable and can be conveniently unlocked using a push button concealed under the cover.\n\nIn order to ensure a more comfortable ride, the spring strut has a new set-up in terms of its spring/damping rates. This was applied together with the new 18-inch rear wheel, with the new tyre dimension 180/55 B 18 to match. Other new features include the now standard daytime running lights (depending on the market) and a USB-C charging socket.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 18 features a silver powertrain, a chrome-plated exhaust system and black cast aluminum wheels. The body colour is Blackstorm Metallic.\n\nIn the Option 719 Olivine variant available ex works as optional equipment, the R 18 has a black powertrain, the Aero design package, surface-enhanced Option 719 Icon cast wheels (19”/16”), a chrome-plated exhaust system and the Option 719 seat. The body finish is Velvet Green Metallic.\n\nThe BMW R 18 Blacked Out equipment variant is new and features black elements almost throughout.\n\nBMW R 18 Classic: even more classic and authentic.The BMW R 18 Classic likewise benefits from a refined design style to further hone its character as a nostalgic touring bike. The most striking new feature is the front mudguard adopted from the R 18 B in conjunction with a 19-inch spoke front wheel (previously 16-inch). The front fender now incorporates the mudguard extension, which has been significantly lowered for a stylish effect. The new fender not only harmonises with the fork sleeves still available for the R 18 Classic but also confidently underlines its affiliation to the nostalgic touring segment. Together with newly designed side covers and rear silencers featuring a circular cross-section, the R 18 Classic now has an even more classic and authentic appearance. Other new features include daytime running lights as standard (depending on the market) and a USB-C charging socket.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 18 Classic has a powertrain finished in silver, a chrome-plated exhaust system, spoked wheels (19”/16”) and fork tube trim elements. The body finishes are Blackstorm Metallic and Mineral Grey Metallic Matt.\n\nIn the Option 719 Aquamarine variant available ex works as optional equipment, theR 18 Classic features a silver powertrain, the Aero design package, surface-enhanced Option 719 Icon cast wheels (19”/16”), the front mudguard of the R 18 Transcontinental, fork tube trim elements, a chrome-plated exhaust system and the Option 719 seat. The body colour is a two-tone paint finish in Blue Planet Metallic/Oriental Blue Metallic.\n\nThe BMW R 18 Classic Blacked Out equipment variant is new and features black elements almost throughout.\n\nBMW R 18 und R 18 Classic Blacked Out: black, elegant and powerfully expressive.In the Blacked Out variant available ex works as optional equipment, the BMW R 18 and R 18 Classic look particularly elegant and powerfully expressive with a range of equipment features in Black High Gloss and Dark Chrome.\n\nThe Blacked Out optional equipment includes the black powertrain, the Design Option Black, the exhaust system in Dark Chrome and other components in Black High Gloss or Dark Chrome\n\nThe BMW R 18 Blacked Out is available in the colours Blackstorm Metallic, Mineral Grey Metallic Matt and Two-Tone Brooklyn Grey.

A switch for the central locking system used to be located here. This has been replaced by the favourites button. The central locking system can still be conveniently controlled using the remote control key.\n\nThe items included in the optional equipment Blacked Out are the black powertrain, the Design Option Black, the exhaust system in Dark Chrome and further components in Black High Gloss or Dark Chrome.

During the Roar before the 24 last weekend, BMW M Motorsport drivers and teams intensely prepared for the first season highlight of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC), the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). One week before the race, three test days featuring seven sessions were held, during which BMW M Team RLL with its two BMW M Hybrid V8s gave strong performances. Dries Vanthoor (BEL) set the overall fastest time with 1:35.424 minutes. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) used the tests to complete their first laps as BMW M works drivers.\n\nIn the GTP category, BMW M Team RLL carried out an extensive testing programme, completing more than 370 laps at the Daytona International Speedway. In the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, Philipp Eng (AUT), Dries Vanthoor, Kevin Magnussen, and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) took turns driving. In car #25, Marco Wittmann (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Robin Frijns (NED), and René Rast (GER) shared the cockpit. Three of the sessions ended with a BMW M Hybrid V8 setting the best time. BMW M Motorsport newcomer Magnussen spent a lot of time getting accustomed to the car and team.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Kelvin van der Linde had his premiere at the wheel of the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paul Miller Racing. He shared driving duties with Madison Snow, Neil Verhagen, and Connor De Phillippi (all USA). In the sister #48 car, Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Augusto Farfus (BRA) were in action. Harper and Hesse missed the first test day due to illness but caught up on their laps without issues later on. In total, the team’s two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs completed around 370 laps. They sported the BMW M Motorsport “Inception” design for the first time, which they will sport throughout the season.\n\nIn the GTD class, Turner Motorsport tested its new BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Over the course of the Roar before the 24, the four drivers Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, Jake Walker (all USA), and Jens Klingmann (GER) completed around 150 laps. Starting next Thursday, the Daytona racing action continues with practice and qualifying. The 24-hour race begins on Saturday, 25th January, at 13:40 local time (19:40 CET). All session can be watched live on \n\nPartnership with Champion Ignition enters its second season. With the race at Daytona, the partnership between BMW M Motorsport and spark plug manufacturer Champion enters its second season. The Champion logo will continue to be featured on the two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL, as it was in 2024. The successful partnership will also continue in the DTM with one of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars featuring the Champion branding. The focus in 2025 is on expanding the collaboration to a technological level. Among other things, both partners are looking to find optimisations for the P66/3 combustion engine used in the hybrid system of the BMW M Hybrid V8, where the ignition system plays a crucial role. On-site, BMW M Motorsport offers employees, customers, and guests of Champion exclusive experiences and provides extraordinary insights into the operations at the racetrack. Both partners also closely coordinate their activation measures and marketing communications.\n\nIn just a few months last season, BMW M Motorsport and Champion celebrated a 1-2 finish for the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Indianapolis (USA), as well as three wins, five podium finishes, and the team title for Schubert Motorsport in the DTM. “It's great to be able to continue and even expand our partnership with Champion. We look forward to continuing our successful collaboration in our programmes in IMSA and DTM. In 2024, the Champion logo on our cars brought us luck,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH.\n\nComments after the Roar before the 24:\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): “I'm happy with how the Roar went. It feels good to know that everything is running smoothly and that the car is performing well. But of course, it all counts next weekend. That's when the winners are crowned, and that's when we need to be there.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): “We had a few very productive test days at the Roar. There are many new things for me to learn at BMW M Motorsport, and I feel more comfortable with every lap on the track. This week is the big test where we can show how strong we really are compared to our competitors. I'm really looking forward to it.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL): “We can be very satisfied with the sessions at the Roar. We've checked many things off our to-do list, so next week we can focus on fine-tuning. The goal is to be well-prepared for the first season highlight and hopefully compete for the podium and the win. Our performance at the Roar was encouraging, but we all know that it really counts in the race.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing): “For me, it was most important to cover as many kilometres as possible in the first few days. Thanks to the support of my teammates, I quickly got used to the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. They really helped me a lot. I feel comfortable in the car and am ready to go full attack at the 24-hour race. We'll have to see where we stand in terms of performance this week, but the mood in the team is good.”\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing): “Max and I caught some virus after our win at the 24H Dubai and didn't feel well, so we missed the first day. Our teammates Jesse and Augusto took the opportunity to prepare the setup of the new car. We built on that on the second day, and I think we have a pretty good base. The team is doing a great job, very organised and professional. We definitely have room for improvement in terms of speed on a single lap, but there are still a few practice sessions left.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport): “Our focus in preparation for the race was clearly on the car's behaviour over the race distance. You don't win a 24-hour race in the first lap, so we worked on finding a good balance and pace for the long runs. The dress rehearsal of the brand-new BMW M4 GT3 EVO went perfectly. We put the car on the track, and everything worked exactly as it should. We are optimistic that we will have a package this week that can compete for the podium.”"}

At BMW Motorrad Welt, located next to the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin-Spandau, the teams and riders unveiled their new bikes for the upcoming season: the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team with World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and Michael van der Mark (NED), as well as the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with Markus Reiterberger (GER), Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), new addition Steven Odendaal (RSA), and Hannes Soomer (EST).\n\n“It’s fantastic to kick off the season together with our entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory family from both world championships, and to do so in the perfect location, BMW Motorrad Welt. This is where the heart of BMW Motorrad production beats, and it is also the home of our racing engines,” said Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport. “We are still in the middle of a busy winter break, but the anticipation for the season grows with each passing day. In WorldSBK, we will see the new BMW M 1000 RR carrying number one, and after winning the title with Toprak last season, the goal is, of course, to become World Champion again. The same applies to the FIM EWC. We’ve stood on the championship podium several times before, and now we want to reach the top step. We are working hard with our teams and riders to achieve these ambitious goals.”\n\nIn WorldSBK, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, led by Team Principal Shaun Muir, will field the new M RR. World Champion Razgatlioglu is entering his second year with the team after an exceptional debut season with BMW Motorrad Motorsport. For van der Mark, this marks his fifth season as a BMW Motorrad factory rider. The WorldSBK season kicks off with the first races on 22nd and 23rd February at Phillip Island (AUS).\n\nThe BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, led by Werner Daemen, secured third place overall in the 2024 FIM EWC standings.

For Guintoli and Soomer, it’s their second season with the team, while Odendaal joins as a new addition this year. The first race, the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), is scheduled for 19th to 20th April.\n\nJoining the stage live at the Season Launch were two well-known members of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport road racing family: Isle of Man winners Peter Hickman and Davey Todd (both GBR), who will race together for FHO Racing BMW in international road races and the British Superbike Championship in 2025.\n\nMore quotes from the Season Launch:\n\nChristian Gonschor (Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport): “I am very excited about the new season, and today’s event showed that the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport and BMW Group are fully behind this. We had both factory racing programmes here, and there couldn’t have been a better way to start the year. The riders were happy, the fans were thrilled, and we as technicians and engineers were as well. The new BMW M 1000 RR is an outstanding foundation for the future. The goal remains, as always, to be successful and to approach every race with full focus. Naturally, we aim to defend the title in WorldSBK. We are now the ones to beat, which presents a challenge for any manufacturer as competitors grow stronger – but so will we. In the Endurance World Championship, we also aim to win the title, and I think that in 2025, with the new motorcycle, the new rider lineup, and the complete team package, we are very well positioned to succeed in endurance racing as well.”\n\nShaun Muir (Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It is great to be here in Berlin. It has been twelve months since we set off the project with Toprak and Michael as a pairing. It is fantastic to see the new 2025 BMW M 1000 RR in the new paint scheme. It’s looking really good. We are just happy that it is now January, pre-season testing starts in one week’s time and then we are quickly off to Australia. The expectations are very high because of the successes both Michael and Toprak had last year. We would like to get one step further for sure to get the manufacturers’ and riders’ championship and also Michael in the top three or four in the World Championship would be sensational. The test team have done everything possible to give us the tools to do the job and we are excited to go to the track. It has been great to be here, to see all the fans, the sponsors and we are looking forward to start the season.”\n\nWerner Daemen (Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “It was a great season launch. BMW Motorrad Welt is a fantastic location, and it’s always amazing to be here at the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin, where our engines are built. It’s great to see how the employees work here and how professional everything is. I’m also very happy that we presented ourselves with our new motorcycle here. We’ve started the year off great, and as the saying goes, if something starts well, it will end well. We can’t wait to get the new season underway. We are well-prepared with a strong bike and a great rider line-up that has already synced up perfectly during the first test.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#1 BMW M 1000 RR, WorldSBK): “It was the second time we did the launch in Berlin and it was even better than last year. Everyone was really happy because now we came here as World Champion. It was exciting. We will now head into the new season. Everyone will see the number one on my bike. In general I am happy. It looks like we are ready to start the season. I hope that we can achieve a lot of success this year, especially together with Mickey. Thank you very much to everyone for the support!”\n\nMichael van der Mark (#60 BMW M 1000 RR, WorldSBK): “It was nice to be here after one year. In this last year, we could see that a lot of people became fans of not just Toprak but of BMW and our entire WorldSBK project. It’s fantastic to be here, and it’s nice to start the season that way. Everything is looking fantastic and now I just want to race the bike. We finished last season so strong with the double podium, I think this is where we should start. I want to get as many podiums as possible. I think the ultimate dream of everyone in the team is to have the riders’, the teams’ and of course the manufacturers’ championship. That would be a nice goal and if we continue like last year, it should be possible.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “The days in Berlin were fantastic. Seeing the plant and also BMW Motorrad Welt is always interesting. The team presentation was something special; there were so many people present, and it is of great importance for us to be introduced together with the WorldSBK team. That gives us an extra boost heading into the new season. It has further strengthened our goal of winning races and securing the title.“\n\nSylvain Guintoli (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been pretty amazing here in Berlin. It is first time here and visiting the factory, seeing how the bikes are being built, the way things are organised, was mindblowing. It has been great for us as the World Endurance project to be officially presented with the WorldSBK effort. There is a really nice vibe about the BMW Motorrad Motorsport programme and it was a pleasure to be here. I enjoyed every second and I can’t wait for the season to start now because with the new bike, the 2025 model, we are confident that we have a package we can win races. I am looking forward to the first race.”\n\nSteven Odendaal (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been a really warm welcome from the team and the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport family. I really enjoyed it. It is a fantastic environment and it has also been a great launch. It brought all the people together and we had really great time. I enjoyed seeing the BMW Motorrad plant as well. I saw all the details and the quality that goes into building this machine for us. So it was very nice to meet all the guys who are building our machines before the season and I am super ready for what’s to come this year. Everything is looking really good and now it’s out time to do our part on track and give it full gas.”\n\nHannes Soomer (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been a great event. I am proud to be part of this family and proud to be here. I am looking forward to the season. My role in the team is to support these three guys to fight for the World Championship. This means that I will do what they need. From my selfish side, I have the most experienced guys in World Endurance in my box so I will learn as much as possible and hopefully step in one of their shoes in the future.”"}

Familiar names and a strong new addition as the rider lineup for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team for the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) is set. South African Steven Odendaal will join the regular riders Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Sylvain Guintoli (FRA). Estonian Hannes Soomer will also be ready again as the fourth rider for the 2025 season.\n\n31-year-old Odendaal has been a permanent fixture in the FIM EWC paddock since 2022, making him a true endurance expert. Previously, he was the overall runner-up in the 2021 FIM Supersport World Championship, competed for eight years in the Moto2 World Championship, and won the Moto2 European Championship in 2016.\n\nReiterberger has been deeply rooted in BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s FIM EWC project from the beginning and will enter his sixth season with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team in 2025. Guintoli, the 2014 Superbike World Champion and 2021 FIM EWC World Champion, joined team manager Werner Daemen’s squad for the 2024 season. For Soomer, it will also be his second year in the team and on the #37 BMW M 1000 RR.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “With this strong rider lineup, we have assembled an important part of our overall package for the FIM EWC 2025. Our clear goal is to become world champions in endurance racing after winning the title in the FIM World Superbike Championship. With our quartet of riders, we are well-prepared for this. Markus Reiterberger has been a key part of the success story of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team from the very beginning. Sylvain Guintoli has been a very important part of the project since last season with all his skill and experience. Newcomer Steven Odendaal has also already made a successful name for himself in the FIM EWC. Additionally, we have a strong fourth rider in Hannes Soomer, who has settled in excellently in his first year on the BMW M 1000 RR and at BMW Motorrad Motorsport. At the same time, we would like to thank Ilya Mikhalchik for his long-standing commitment to the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. He has also been instrumental in shaping the team from the beginning and setting it on the path to success.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “With our rider lineup, we are well-prepared to enter the title fight in 2025. Markus is our stalwart, and we are excited to enter our sixth FIM EWC season together with him. Sylvain was a great addition to our team in 2024, and it’s fantastic that our collaboration with him continues. Our new addition Steven has already been testing with us, and he has quickly settled into the team. In Hannes, we have a strong fourth rider who made a great contribution to the team last year. However, in an endurance team, it’s not just about speed and skill, but also team spirit – and that’s an aspect that distinguishes our quartet. Unfortunately, Ilya will no longer be with us. I thank him for the many years together and wish him success in the future.”"}

They will hopefully create many great moments alongside our three works drivers. In the IMSA series, Paul Miller Racing is going all out with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs in the GTD PRO class, supported by a high-class selection of works drivers. The reunion of the former BMW Junior Team with Dan Harper, Max Hesse, and Neil Verhagen in one championship and team is a great bonus that underlines the extreme success of the relaunch of the legendary BMW M Motorsport talent promotion programme.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “In the 2025 season, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO makes its debut, and the FIA WEC and IMSA series are two of the most prestigious arenas for the car.

The strong driver line-ups of the WRT, Paul Miller Racing, and Turner Motorsport teams provide the optimal conditions for this. Looking at the IMSA series, I am thrilled with how Paul Miller Racing is approaching the new season. With the team's experience, the new car, and the driver line-up, the focus can only be on targeting the title in the GTD PRO class. Turner Motorsport was in contention for the GTD championship for a long time in 2024. I am convinced that Will Turner's experienced team will play a great role again in the upcoming season. I can hardly wait for the first races.“\n\nValentino Rossi: “Very happy to continue my experience in the FIA WEC, as last year was a strong debut season. We had some good races including two podiums and we want to try to be stronger and faster. We will work hard together with BMW M Motorsport to improve our performance and be more competitive in every race. It’s great to once again race at some fantastic tracks, that I know well from racing motorcycles, and this makes me enjoy racing in the FIA WEC.

The record-breaking journey of BMW M GmbH continues: In the 2024 fiscal year, the sports car manufacturer of BMW reached a new all-time high in vehicle sales for the 13th consecutive year. With 206,582 vehicles, BMW M GmbH once again improved the benchmark, after having exceeded the threshold of 200,000 vehicles sold for the first time in the company's history the previous year. The impressive performance capabilities of the performance and high-performance vehicles are reflected in the growing demand across model classes, drive types, and regions.\n\nThe all-electric BMW i4 M50* was the best-selling model for the third time in a row. It transfers the typical M combination of agility, dynamics, and precision into the world of electromobility: With an electric motor at the front and rear axle, which together generate a maximum output of 400 kW/544 hp, the Gran Coupé offers a fascinating driving experience with a range of up to 522 kilometers according to WLTP. But vehicles with other drive systems also saw increases.\n\n\"The high demand for both gasoline-powered and electric models shows that our technology-neutral strategy is also paying off in the performance and high-performance segment, driving us to record results,\" says Sylvia Neubauer, Head of Customer, Brand and Sales at BMW M GmbH. \"Anyone looking for a sporty driving experience will always find it at BMW M - in every vehicle category and drive variant.\"\n\nThe unbroken demand for vehicles with outstanding driving performance is also reflected in the growing share that BMW M models contribute to the success of the entire BMW Group. In 2024, almost every tenth vehicle sold was an M model (9.4% share). This is also a new record high.\n\nHigh-performance models drive growth at top speed.\n\nThe biggest growth drivers in the 2024 fiscal year were the high-performance models, which combine untamed racetrack power with unrestricted road capability. After the 2024 model revisions of the BMW M2*, BMW M3*, and BMW M4* model series, as well as the new editions of the BMW M5* and BMW M5 Touring*, the segment is shining with top performances: The BMW M2 achieved a 64% increase, making it the top performer in terms of growth dynamics. With its muscular proportions and powerful design features, the model athlete makes no secret of its performance capabilities, which are embodied by the optimized M TwinPower Turbo straight-six-cylinder engine with 353 kW/480 hp. The M3 Touring* grew by +57%.\n\nThe high-performance segment is also increasingly electrifying more customers. The BMW XM*, as the first electrified high-performance model, recorded a sales increase of 16%. It combines pioneering drive technology with a spectacular vehicle concept: The specially developed M HYBRID System of the Sports Activity Vehicle mobilizes a maximum output of up to 550 kW/748 hp in the top model BMW XM Label*. Uncompromising design and fascinating performance create maximum exclusivity and make the BMW XM a completely new model in the luxury segment.\n\nOverall, the high-performance models crossed the finish line in the 2024 fiscal year with 66,805 vehicles sold and an increase of 8%. \"More customers than ever before worldwide are enthusiastic about the typical BMW M combination of expressive design with extensive individualization options, highly dynamic driving performance, and perfection in manufacturing,\" says Sylvia Neubauer. \"The M evokes emotions: All our models have motorsport genes and stand for driving pleasure at the highest level.\"\n\nInternational lead of M models continues to grow.\n\nIn both the performance segment and the particularly exclusive high-performance area, BMW M GmbH is leading the international competition and further increased its lead in the 2024 fiscal year. Thus, BMW M remains at the top with a large gap to the core competitors. In the USA and the UK, as well as in Germany, BMW M is the market leader among sports car manufacturers. \"In the three largest markets, we are number one with a clear lead,\" says Franciscus van Meel, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW M GmbH. \"This expression of trust motivates us to deliver another strong performance in 2025, despite the continued highly challenging economic environment.\"\n\nFurther expansion of model diversity in focus.\n\nWith the further expansion of model diversity, BMW M GmbH is setting accents in 2025 as well. On the agenda are various special models and model revisions with innovations for combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, and electric drives alike. In addition, the development of the new all-electric BMW M3 is progressing. \"Our offering spans the entire range of BMW models and includes performance and high-performance variants with all-electric, partially electric, and purely combustion-powered drives,\" says van Meel. \"We will continue to pursue and further develop this successful strategy.\"\n\nBMW M Motorsport provides emotions, success, and strong sales figures.\n\nAnother focus is on motorsport. In 2024, the return to the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) of BMW M GmbH earned, among other things, a podium finish in the GT3 class at the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans. The BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car by artist Julie Mehretu also caused a sensation among the more than 300,000 spectators on site and the sports and culture media worldwide. In the past season, the three current BMW M Motorsport racing vehicles, the BMW M Hybrid V8, the BMW M4 GT3, and the BMW M4 GT4, together celebrated 215 victories, completed more than 1,000 races, and covered over one million kilometers. In 2025, the focus will be on successes with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the FIA WEC and the North American IMSA series. On the customer motorsport side, the EVO versions of the BMW M4 GT3 and the BMW M4 GT4 are entering their debut seasons. Both vehicles are selling extremely successfully and demonstrate the extraordinary popularity of BMW M Motorsport products with customers around the world.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nChristophe Koenig, Head of BMW M and BMW M Motorsport Communications\n\nAlexandra Landers, Head of BMW Product and Brand Communications\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide.

With electric mobility continuing to gather pace, recycling high-voltage batteries is increasingly under the spotlight. After successfully launching a closed-loop recycling system for the reuse of raw materials from high-voltage batteries thanks to the BMW Brilliance Automotive Joint Venture (BBA) in China in 2022, the BMW Group has now hit another milestone on its journey. On 1 November 2024, it launched a pan-European partnership with SK tes, a leading provider of innovative technology lifecycle solutions. The special recycling process recovers cobalt, nickel and lithium from used batteries before returning them to the value chain to make new batteries. This closed-loop system is set to expand to the US-Mexico-Canada region as early as 2026. Its long-term partnership with SK tes sees the BMW Group directly involved in the practical recycling processes, allowing it to feed back valuable insights to the development departments. Moving forward, high-voltage batteries from BMW Group development, production and markets in Europe that are no longer fit for use are to be delivered to SK tes in what is the first step towards an effective and sustainable circular economy for batteries. SK tes then converts the old batteries into high-quality metals that can be reintroduced to battery production. The latter process sees the batteries mechanically shredded, during which the metals are concentrated to leave a material called black mass. The valuable materials, namely nickel, lithium and cobalt, are then recovered in a highly effective chemical process called hydrometallurgy. Among other things, these secondary raw materials will be used for the new GEN 6 drive train. \"Partnerships like this increase our efficiency in terms of the circular economy. In the closed-loop process, all partners mutually benefit from their experiences,\" says Jörg Lederbauer, Vice President Circular Economy, Spare Parts Supply High Voltage Battery and Electric Powertrain at BMW AG. The battery recycling process of SK tes has won numerous sustainability and innovation awards worldwide – from the Business Intelligence Group’s Sustainability Service of the Year to the UN Global Compact’s Apex Award. Circular economy at the BMW Group \"The promotion of circular economy is an important strategic topic for the BMW Group. The development of recyclable products, the increase of secondary materials in our components, and the closing of loops play an equally important role,\" says Nadine Philipp, Vice President Sustainability Supplier Network at BMW AG. \"And by the means of circular economy we are also increasing our resilience in the supply chains.\" The BMW Group follows the principles of Re:Think, Re:Duce, Re:Use, and Re:Cycle in the sense of a conservation of resources when it comes to circular economy. From vehicle design and production to recycling and reuse: everything is geared towards ensuring BMW vehicles become a raw materials source for new cars once they reach the end of their useful life. One such example is the BMW Group’s Recycling and Dismantling Centre.

Winning a 24-hour race with a brand-new car and securing a class win as well is far from a given. Congratulations to AlManar Racing by Team WRT and Paradine Competition, and a big thank you to them for making this such a successful debut for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. My thanks also go to everyone at BMW M Motorsport who worked so hard on the development of this car, making this success possible, and to the drivers, whose outstanding performances contributed to this debut victory. Congratulations also to AGMC Racing by Simpson Motorsport on their win in the GT4 class. What a way to start the year; now we’re looking forward to the next races!”\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal Team WRT: “What a way to start the 2025 season, and our partnership with AlManar Racing. It’s a huge achievement to claim the win on the debut of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. It was a race of determination and executing the perfect strategy. The crew made zero mistakes and performed flawless pitstops, and we know that makes all the difference in these races, so a monumental congratulations to them. I take my hat off to the drivers. It is the first time they have all raced together, and in a new car, so I am very proud that we have been able to give them their first overall win at the Dubai 24H and marking our fourth victory here. Congratulations also to Darren for adding a victory in the GT3 AM class! This makes me very excited for the year ahead!”\n\nMax Hesse (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT): “I’m super happy!

We were not the fastest out on track, but we focused on our work, and it paid off.”\n\nDan Harper (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT): “My debut with the BMW M4 GT3 Evo, debut in a 24-hour race with Team WRT and debut for Al Faisal with BMW M Motorsport. A great victory! The whole team had a perfect race and made no mistakes. The strategy was set up perfectly by the team and all the drivers did their job. It was a fantastic race and I’m so glad to get my first 24 hour-race victory under my belt! Hopefully many more to come!”\n\nAl Faisal Al Zubair (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT): “What an amazing feeling! I've been trying to win this race for a couple of years now, and I started to think that it was not meant to be (laughs). First race with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, first race with Team WRT, it couldn’t have started better than to win the 24 Hours of Dubai. I’m extremely proud to do it under the AlManar Racing banner and hopefully it is the start of a successful journey!”\n\nDarren Leung (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT / #991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition): “I am very tired but extremely happy! I just had to hold everything together as well as I could. We knew the double victory was a possibility thanks to the quality of both the teams, and both driver lineups. Everything needed to come into the right place, and it did. I am very fortunate and very thankful to everyone!.”\n\nAhmad Al Harthy (#991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition): “I am really delighted with our performance.

Sporting a special design and equipped with the characteristic Safety Car roof beam, the car will appear on track at many of the most popular Special Events.\n\nAs in real-world motor racing, a lead car will take the field around a formation lap at classic iRacing events such as the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring (GER), or the “Petit Le Mans” at Road Atlanta (USA), before the participants launch their hunt for points with a “flying start”. The BMW M2 CS Racing is the youngest member of the BMW M Motorsport fleet on iRacing, while the BMW M2 Racing successor model is ready and waiting to hit the real racetrack for the 2026 season.\n\n“This Safety Car partnership represents a new chapter in the success story shared by BMW M Motorsport and iRacing,” said Timo Brückner, Project Lead BMW M Automotive Gaming. “Each season, the Special Events attract record levels of participants and have become real community favourites. For example, nearly 20,000 drivers competed in the 24 Hours of Daytona last year. I am delighted that we will enjoy a prominent position next season at the head of the field, with the BMW M2 CS Racing at these highlight events.

The BMW Group presents the driving and user experience of the future at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in Las Vegas. BMW is providing the first opportunity to experience the close-to-production version of the new BMW iDrive – complete with its centrepiece, BMW Panoramic Vision – at the event. The software underpinning it all is the new BMW Operating System X, which acts as the intelligence hub behind the new display and operating concept. The holistic system, with its modern, style-shaping design, will be introduced in all new BMW models from the end of 2025.“High tech meets highly intuitive operation – a quarter of a century of pioneering work and technological leadership in operating concepts has been channelled into the new BMW Panoramic iDrive,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development.“The foundations are provided by the new BMW Operating System X. With this advance, we are giving one of the world’s best and most comprehensive infotainment systems even greater capability and once again setting the industry benchmark in multimodal interaction. Starting with the first series-produced Neue Klasse model at the end of this year, the new BMW Panoramic iDrive will form an integral part of all future BMW models.”\n\nFour elements, one goal: consistent driver focus in characteristic BMW style.The new BMW iDrive merges four central elements into a unique display and operating concept.\n\nThe combination of these four elements re-interprets BMW’s customary “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach, with which BMW sets the benchmark for driver focus and presents a unique form of intuitive, use-friendly and ergonomically optimised operation. The BMW Panoramic iDrive always gives the driver the right information in the right place and at the right time. The system continues the approach of using an optimal combination of analogue and digital controls through the use of switches, buttons, touch and voice control. There are haptic switches for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selectors and window de-icers. Other functions are optimised for operation using touch/voice control or via the multifunction steering wheel, such as telephone functions, media control systems, navigation, assisted driving, personalisation of displays, selection of MyModes and much more besides.\n\nAlongside data-driven learnings on the use of BMW Operating Systems across the global fleet of now more than 22 million connected BMW vehicles, the development phase of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive also included numerous studies conducted in the BMW Group’s usability labs, in which around 3,000 customers were involved. Every decision on the various aspects of the operating logic is therefore based on data and made in a structured manner. Here, the user experience’s extended scope for personalisation has also been aligned with customer preferences and requirements.\n\nBMW Operating System X: intelligent, versatile, fit for the future.The new BMW Operating System X represents an update of the latest operating system, as used in many BMW models, and is a wholly in-house development from BMW. Like BMW Operating System 9, it is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. It offers even greater update and upgrade capability than the predecessor system, making it both fit for the future and backwards compatible. It is ready to accommodate additional functions and will keep vehicles equipped with the new BMW Panoramic iDrive at the cutting edge of technology over a long period of time. “The overall concept of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive with Operating System X has been enabled by a large technological leap forward,” says Stephan Durach Senior Vice President Connected Company BMW Group. “It offers intuitive operation, emotionally engaging experiences and specific personalisation. The new BMW iDrive with Operating System X demonstrates the potential of a software-defined vehicle.”\n\nThe expanded intelligence of BMW Operating System X makes it possible to combine the BMW Panoramic Vision, optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display, central display and multifunction steering wheel with one another in such a way that physical and digital experiences merge. For example, an incoming call initially brings up a graphic on the BMW Panoramic Vision. At the same time, a symbol on the relevant steering wheel button that was not previously visible is illuminated in green, indicating the option of taking the call by pressing the button or rejecting it with a swipe on the right-hand side of the steering wheel. When a navigation destination is entered by touch control or voice command, route guidance alerts are shown on the BMW 3D Head-Up Display and further information on roads and junctions on the BMW Panoramic Vision. A whole map overview can be shown on the central display at any time for broader-scale orientation.\n\nThe personalisation of content reaches a new level with BMW Operating System X. The displays in the Panoramic Vision can be adapted to personal preferences. In addition, drivers now also have the option of choosing their own settings for driving attributes such as response and steering characteristics in the My Mode “Personal”. Moreover, pictures chosen by the user can be uploaded as backgrounds for the Central Display and the colourway of the Ambient Lighting and user interface design adjusted to their particular preferences, creating an even more personalised driving experience.\n\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant responds in the accustomed way to the prompt “Hey BMW” or can be called up by pressing the respective button on the multifunction steering wheel. The capabilities of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant are being constantly enhanced and will be taken to a whole new level for the Neue Klasse through the integration of Large Language Models (LLM). The use of this technology is focused initially on navigation, allowing the customer to give more extensive spoken commands using natural language: for example: “Take me to a charging station which is close to a food store.” At technology partner Amazon’s booth at CES 2025, visitors can get an initial impression of these capabilities using a beta version of this build of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in a BMW X3.\n\nAs with the current infotainment systems from BMW, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant can – if the driver desires – make suggestions proactively based on user behaviour. This intelligence expands further with BMW Operating System X. In relevant situations, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant highlights driver assistance systems, which are rarely used by the driver. As a kind of reminder, the system suggests activating Sport Mode on suitable routes if the driver has already activated Sport Mode independently beforehand. If the driver doesn’t respond to or ignores these proactive suggestions several times, the system learns and refrains from making suggestions from then on.\n\nBMW Operating System X carries over the scope for integration of third-party apps from the previous infotainment generation. As things stand, the BMW ConnectedDrive Store offers more than 60 apps worldwide for BMW Operating System 9. The selection will continue to grow, e.g. with productivity apps such as video conferencing service Zoom.\n\nDesign and technology for a unique user and driving experience.The new BMW Panoramic iDrive is scalable and will be integrated into all new BMW models – across all vehicle segments and with all drive system technologies – from the end of 2025.\n\nThe driving experience takes centre stage. The driver should feel at ease and have full control over the vehicle. This principle is reflected in the design of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive. Particular attention is paid to the details: the user interface has been designed as intuitively and adaptively as possible to ensure seamless interaction. The result is a holistic experience enhanced by a harmonious combination of sound, light and innovative design. Every journey becomes a special moment of connection between human and vehicle. “Technology and customer preferences are changing more quickly than ever. The design of digital experiences and sound is playing an ever more important role,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. “The new BMW Panoramic iDrive not only makes our vehicles smarter and more user-friendly, it also enables much more extensive personalisation, which turns every new BMW into a car that is very much the user’s own.”Another element in the holistic experience provided by the BMW Panoramic iDrive is the new HypersonX sound experience in the Neue Klasse models. Developed by the BMW Group Sound Design Studio, it comprises 43 sound signals and special driving sounds for Personal Mode and Sport Mode. The multi-dimensional spectrum adapts the sounds precisely to the driving situation at hand and, in so doing, creates an emotional interaction between the driver and their BMW."}

These days the question of how stable a business is, is increasingly coming under the spotlight. Crisis-proof companies are characterised by targeted planning, the flexibility to adapt to volatility, and good leadership. But organisations that meet these criteria also make desirable employers – as shown by numerous studies in 2024 that rate the BMW Group as highly attractive in this regard.\n\nOne example is the Trendence Professionals Barometer. Here the BMW Group once again topped the rankings in 2024 as the best employer – for the thirteenth time in a row. A leading study in gauging employer attractiveness, the Trendence survey questioned 15,000 university-educated employees in Germany to ascertain the best employers for professionals. 2024 also saw the BMW Group top the tables in other global and market-specific employer rankings, such as the World’s Most Attractive Employers, by Universum, and the World’s Best Employers, by Forbes.\n\n\"You don't automatically become the best employer.

The survey involved 15,000 students of various disciplines from universities and colleges across Germany.\n\nAmong business graduates, the BMW Group was able to boost its approval ratings and rise to second place in the rankings. Another area where the BMW Group is improving is IT, and it now ranks fourth, as the most attractive automotive employer.\n\nIn the Trendence School Student Barometer, the company rose from fourth to third place, making it the most popular automotive employer again. 15,000 school students took part in the study.\n\nHighly sought-after skilled workers also voted the BMW Group into the top spot as an employer, in the Trendence Skilled Workers Barometer 2024. This surveyed 21,000 employees in Germany and awarded the BMW Group first place.\n\nBMW Group among top employers globally too\n\nThe current ranking of the World’s Most Attractive Employers 2024, by Universum, surveyed more than 144,000 students from the nine leading economies and ranked the BMW Group fifth among prospective engineers worldwide. The company also ranks among the top 17 employers globally for IT and business students.\n\nThe BMW Group offers exciting challenges for young as well as more seasoned professionals in forward-looking fields such as battery research and automated driving as well as software development, IT architecture for databases and cloud systems, and app development. Applications are always welcome! In addition, BMW Group production facilities around the world are constantly looking for electrical maintenance and system management specialists as well as production planners and control technicians.\n\nTalented people with an interest in joining the BMW Group can learn more about working with the company, how to join and current job offers from the BMW Group Careers page of our website or the BMW Group Careers social media channels:\n\nZeit für neue Perspektiven\n\nInnovation durch Vielfalt\n\nDr. Hans-Peter Ketterl\n\nSpokesperson for Human Resources and\n\nMember of the Board of Management for Human Resources and Real Estate\n\nIn 2023, the BMW Group sold over 2.55 million passenger vehicles and more than 209,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2023 was € 17.1 billion on revenues amounting to € 155.5 billion. As of 31 December 2023, the BMW Group had a workforce of 154,950 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action, from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products."}

In winning the coveted award for the second consecutive year, the BMW Championship became the first event to be named Tournament of the Year six times (2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2023, 2024).\n\n“It’s an honor to be recognized in this way because each year we truly give the BMW Championship everything we’ve got,” said Marcus Casey, Chief Marketing Officer, BMW of North America. “Tournament week is an invaluable opportunity to showcase our brand on an international stage while engaging with fans in a meaningful way. Thank you to the PGA TOUR for this honor, and to the BMW team, our partners, the volunteers, and fans who bring the BMW Championship to life each year. This extraordinary event would not be possible without your commitment, dedication, and passion.”\n\nThe BMW Championship delivered the “Ultimate Fan Experience” in 2024, focusing on spectator entry, access, and transportation across the unique terrain of Castle Pines to provide a seamless fan experience and the best vantage points to watch the TOUR’s top players up close.\n\n“We set high expectations for our return to Colorado, and I think we delivered the best possible experience for the players, caddies, corporate partners and – most importantly – our incredible fans,” Pellegrino said. “This is a tremendous honor and a testament to everyone who worked so hard to make this tournament happen, especially our title sponsor BMW.”\n\nNext year, the 2025 BMW Championship will take place from 12th to 17th August at Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills, Maryland."}

Its debut year in the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and its second year in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) posed significant challenges for engineers, teams, and drivers. After initial disappointments, a strong upward trend emerged, culminating in the first 1-2 finish for BMW M Team RLL in the IMSA series and the first podium for BMW M Team WRT in the FIA WEC. The hard work is reflected in the numbers, with a total of 82,400 racing and testing kilometres, equivalent to 460 hours.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT3, in its third season, secured 50 victories and ten global titles. Key achievements include team titles for Schubert Motorsport in the DTM and Team WRT in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, as well as the driver's title for Charles Weerts (BEL) in the Intercontinental GT Challenge.

Successes with the three current BMW M Motorsport race cars were complemented by numerous triumphs for private teams with the BMW M2 CS Racing, BMW M240i Racing, and many other self-built BMW models from various generations.\n\nThe 2024 season was also a complete success for BMW M Motorsport in automotive gaming. BMW M Team Redline triumphed at the prestigious Esports World Cup, the grand finale of the ESL R1 racing series, both in the team standings and with Kevin Siggy (SLO) in the driver's standings. His teammate Sebastian Job (GBR) was named “Sim Racer of the Year” at the 2024 Esports Awards.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The figures for the 2024 season of BMW M Motorsport are impressive and underline our strong commitment to various areas of motorsport. From the top class in prototype racing to professional GT3 sport, pure customer racing with the BMW M4 GT4 and many other cars, as well as automotive gaming, BMW M Motorsport is one of the biggest competitors worldwide. I am very pleased with this strong performance and congratulate all the teams and drivers who were able to celebrate successes in BMW M Motorsport cars in 2024. Next season, we are determined to go even further with the BMW M Hybrid V8 and the further developed EVO models of our GT cars, aiming for the top step of the podium at the major season highlights.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations and thank you to all BMW M Motorsport customer teams that contributed to our impressive season figures in the GT sector.

In 2025, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M4 GT4 EVO will play the leading roles, but we also have our newcomer in the pipeline, the entry-level BMW M2 Racing, which we are preparing for its debut season in 2026 with intensive testing. I can't wait for it to start again in January with the first endurance highlights in Dubai and at Daytona.”"}

I am especially proud of our team at Plant Regensburg, who once again showed tremendous commitment and flexibility, despite volatile market conditions. We have achieved our projected growth target for production of fully-electric vehicles in Regensburg in 2024, as promised.\n\nMore than a third of the vehicles built at our plant this year were electrified – i.e. a plug-in hybrid or an all-electric model.

The more than 250 million existing vehicles in Europe are an important factor here: Their CO2 balance could be significantly improved if the regenerative share of fuel was increased. We are going ahead: From January 2025, we will fill up all diesel models produced in Germany with HVO 100 before delivery to dealers — a high-quality diesel replacement with up to 90% lower CO2e emissions in the overall balance sheet.” says Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management, BMW AG.\n\nThe BMW Group is now sending a clear signal and is converting the initial filling of all diesel models produced in Germany to HVO 100. The abbreviation HVO stands for “hydrotreated vegetable oil” and the addition “100” indicates that it is to 100 percent, i.e. as pure fuel.\n\n“Neste MY Renewable Diesel™” is the HVO 100 fuel used at BMW Group plants, Munich, Dingolfing, Regensburg and Leipzig, which produce annually more than 50 percent of BMW Groups Diesel powered vehicles. Fuel from the Finnish manufacturer Neste enables a GHG reduction of up to 90 percent (“Well to Wheel”) over the life cycle of the fuel, compared to fossil diesel. The initial filling at the plants before delivery to the BMW Group sales organization is five to eight liters, depending on the model.\n\nSince the end of May 2024, paraffinic diesel HVO may also be sold at gas stations in Germany. The fuel is produced from various wastes such as cooking oils, as well as residues and other renewable raw materials.It meets high quality- and sustainability standards, Palm oil is not used during production nor does the product consist of conventional biodiesel.\n\nThe fuel makes a significant contribution to CO2 reduction compared to the use of fossil fuels.\n\nCompared with fossil-based diesel, HVO 100 is a higher-quality product and offers a host of technical advantages: as well as emitting less CO2, its chemical properties offer better cold start behaviour. It is also resistant to microbial contamination (“diesel plague”) because of its purity. To increase the availability of renewable fuels the BMW Group is calling for ambitious quotas of at least 30 percent real greenhouse gas reductions in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), which must be implemented in national law by the end of May 2025.\n\nThe BMW Group and Neste, with its headquarters in Espoo, Finland, are working together to realize this potential. The BMW Group diesel engines, which are developed at plant Steyr (Austria), and almost all of them produced there as well, have been approved for the HVO 100 fuel in accordance with the European fuel standard EN 15940, starting with the production month of March 2015 for specific models and models. Customers can see detailed information about this here.\n\nConstantly testing. The BMW Group is constantly testing the compatibility of new fuels for its engines, in addition to HVO 100, B10 and all e-fuels approved for diesel engines within the EN590 fuel standard - for petrol engines, E25 and eFuels approved within the EN228 fuel standard. The use of higher regenerative components in the fuel is also a potentially important contribution to CO2 reduction in gasoline engines. However, to do this, the EU must extend the upper limit set in the outdated Fuel Quality Directive from the current E10 to E20 or E25. Successful test in factory logistics as well.\n\nSince March 2023, Neste-produced HVO 100 has also been used in BMW Group plant logistics trucks: On the motorway between Landau / Isar and the BMW Group plant in Munich, four trucks from logistics service provider Guggemos (GV Trucknet) have been driving the route several times a day. They supply the Munich parent plant on a just-in-time basis. This was extended to six more trucks. These trucks belong to DB Schenker's fleet and use shuttle services to transport warehouse parts from the BMW Group supply center in Eching for production in Munich. The trucks cover a good 40 kilometers on every round trip.\n\nBMW Group joins the eFuels Alliance. The BMW Group is a new member of the eFuel Alliance. Together, the partners want to promote a pragmatic regulatory framework and a rapid market ramp-up for renewable fuels. The cooperation should also encourage other industry representatives to adopt renewable fuels as a further complementary technology path."}

To achieve its ambitious goals in both race series, BMW M Motorsport joins its forces in terms of driver line-up. Eight BMW M works drivers will share the driving duties for BMW M Team WRT in the FIA WEC and BMW M Team RLL in the IMSA series. New to the team is Formula 1 driver Kevin Magnussen (DEN). He will be joined by Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), René Rast (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) .\n\nIn the BMW M Team WRT line-up for the FIA WEC, there is one change compared to the debut season. In the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Magnussen will start alongside Marciello and Vanthoor. The crew of car #20 remains unchanged with Frijns, Rast, and van der Linde. Wittmann continues as a regular driver in the LMDh programme but switches from the FIA WEC to the IMSA series with BMW M Team RLL. Eng stays in North America and will enter his third season with the BMW M Hybrid V8 there. Van der Linde and Vanthoor will take on a dual role, competing as regular drivers in both the FIA WEC and the full IMSA season. Vanthoor and Eng will share the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, while van der Linde and Wittmann will drive the #25 sister car.\n\nDue to scheduling conflicts between the two racing series, only two drivers per car will participate in the FIA WEC event at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) in May. Vanthoor and van der Linde will simultaneously race in the IMSA event at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nFor the endurance races of the IMSA series at Daytona, Sebring, and Road Atlanta (all USA), the other four LMDh drivers will supplement the line-ups. Magnussen will compete in all three races in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, with Marciello joining as the fourth driver at Daytona. In car #25, Frijns will drive all three races, with Rast completing the Daytona quartet.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We have high goals for the upcoming season with our BMW M Hybrid V8 prototypes. To achieve these, we are striving for optimisations in all areas. For our driver line-up, this means focusing and specialising. The more time our drivers spend behind the wheel of the BMW M Hybrid V8, the better they will get to know its handling and the more feedback they can provide to our engineers. The goal is to intensify the development of the BMW M Hybrid V8 in collaboration with the specialists at the teams and at BMW M Motorsport. It also helps us in this regard, that some drivers compete in both championships, thereby further improving the exchange of information. We are convinced that this way joining our forces will bring us advantages. Of course, the schedule overlap in May is not ideal, but we have the regulatory option to compete in a 6-hour FIA WEC race with two drivers per car, which we will utilise. The fact that the season starts in January with the 24-hour race at Daytona is very beneficial for us. This allows us to have all eight drivers together for an extended period early in the season, helping us to optimally synchronise with each other.”"}

After the 2024 season, an era comes to an end at BMW M Motorsport with Bruno Spengler (CAN) leaving after 13 years as a BMW M works driver, at his own request, to face new professional challenges. By winning the DTM title in the comeback year in 2012, he secured his place in BMW M Motorsport history books. With Spengler's departure, a true fan favourite and a great ambassador for the BMW brand is leaving .\n\nAt the end of 2011, Bruno Spengler joined BMW M Motorsport to play a key role in the brand's return to the DTM for the 2012 season. He celebrated his first victory in just the second race at the Lausitzring (GER) in his matte black BMW M3 DTM. Spengler won a total of four races in 2012 and was crowned champion in a thrilling season finale at Hockenheim (GER). At the same time, BMW M Team Schnitzer and BMW M Motorsport celebrated winning the team and manufacturer championships. The “Black Beast” became his trademark in the following years. Between 2012 and 2019, Spengler competed in 122 DTM races for BMW M Motorsport, achieving seven victories and 24 podium finishes.\n\nSpengler was also successful in GT racing. He achieved podium finishes at both the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) and the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA). In 2015, he formed a trio with Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) and Timo Glock (GER) at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), driving the now legendary BMW Z4 GT3 in Michel Vaillant design.

The new Aeroacoustics and Electric Drive Center (AEC) starts operations at the BMW Group's Research and Innovation Center (FIZ). After almost forty years, the old aeroacoustic wind tunnel is being replaced by BMW. The building consists of two halves: In addition to a multifunctional part with workshop, testing and measurement equipment and a prototype for high-voltage batteries and inverters, the AEC has a technically and structurally unique wind tunnel. With a length of just under 100 m, a height of 45 m and a width of 25 m, it is the world's largest vertical acoustic wind tunnel and at the same time the quietest.\n\n“Quiet is premium,” says Daniel Böttger, Head of Complete Vehicle Development at BMW AG. “Our focus is on meeting the premium standards of our vehicles. An important part of this is acoustics — particularly for quiet electric models.” The new wind tunnel enables groundbreaking advances in aeroacoustics research.”\n\n“The new AEC is another structural milestone for the BMW Group's development of future mobility solutions,” says Dr. Nicole Haft-Zboril, Head of BMW Group Real Estate Management. “About such a complex project\n\nTo be implemented in the shortest possible time, cost-effectively and with very high quality, there is a need for close integration between construction, development and production, as well as with all our partners and the City of Munich. The consistent use of lean construction is an important success factor here. ”\n\nQuiet wind for precise measurements and perfect aerodynamics\n\nWith a background noise level (54.3 dB (A) at 140 km/h), which is as low as a quiet conversation or a quiet air conditioning system, the noises caused by headwind on the vehicle can be precisely measured in the new wind tunnel. With a nozzle cross section of 25 m² and a maximum wind speed of 250 km/h, even the largest and most powerful vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom or the BMW X7 can be examined realistically. This is achieved through a blower capacity of 4.5 MW and up to 100,000 m³ of air per minute at 250 km/h. The wind tunnel is designed as an acoustic semi-free-field space. This means that apart from the sound-resistant floor, there are no sound reflections. This enables a realistic simulation of the situation on the road. The frequency range for semi-free-field conditions from 30 Hz is unique for a vehicle wind tunnel and covers the entire audible spectrum.\n\nInnovative measurement technology, high flexibility and short changeover times\n\nThe acoustic wind tunnel is equipped with the latest measurement technology to drive vehicle development forward. A 216-microphone acoustic camera enables precise localization of background noises with an accuracy of less than one centimeter. In addition, the wind tunnel has a laser vibrometry system, which can be used to measure the mechanical vibrations of the entire vehicle surface synchronously and without contact.\n\nThe wind tunnel is also ideally equipped to study wind and rolling noises. A full-fledged acoustic all-wheel drive roller dynamometer can be used regardless of wind and weather to analyze the various phenomena. The wind tunnel is designed in such a way that it offers a high degree of flexibility when carrying out measurements.\n\nThe wind rolling sound makes it possible to separate the phenomena of rolling and wind from each other (wind on/off, roll on/off). In addition, various modules, such as a vehicle-accessible glass floor or a vehicle scale for motorcycles, can be replaced in a short time without moving the vehicle. This allows developers to test different configurations quickly and efficiently. With this unique combination of performance, precision and flexibility, the new acoustic wind tunnel in Munich sets new standards in vehicle development and opens up new opportunities for optimizing vehicle acoustics and aerodynamics.\n\nIn this way, the quietest wind tunnel and the most modern measurement technology can be used to ensure the best aeroacoustics for the Neue Klasse.\n\nFlexibility is also of central importance in construction\n\nThe AEC basically consists of two buildings that were built in an excavation pit. Structurally, the special acoustic requirements were met with a special decoupling of the wind tunnel from the second “semi-detached house” and the surrounding area. The entire building, from the 3 m thick floor slab to the façade, is sound-insulated against noises from the surrounding area. The entire construction work was carried out in the outbuildings while development was ongoing. The wind tunnel was designed to be upright so that the building ground is used as efficiently as possible. This was the only way to completely meet all requirements for both buildings and to be implemented on the existing space.\n\nPrototypes for the future of electric mobility: high-voltage batteries and inverters\n\nThe second “semi-detached house” of AEC is home to workshops, testing and measurement stands, and prototype lines. Here, the focus is also on electric mobility. The experts from the BMW Group are building and testing prototypes of future high-voltage batteries for electric vehicles here. 15,000 m² are available for this purpose on several floors. On a further area of 800 m², inverters for future electric motors will be manufactured on a pilot line — under clean room conditions. The inverter is a crucial component in an electric motor. His task is, among other things, to convert the direct current from the high-voltage battery into alternating current for use in the electric motor. In order to be flexible in the long term, the spaces in AEC are designed to be “multifunctional”. This means that the company will also be able to respond to various requirements in the future and rebuild the spaces within a short period of time."}

In early December, BMW provided him and nearly 30 other young people from the partner organisation with a special day as part of the “Dunks for Tomorrow” initiative. First, they received an exclusive tour of the diverse world of the BMW Group at the BMW Museum, then they cheered on FC Bayern Munich Basketball at a home game in BMW Park.\n\nThe group was transported to the BMW Museum in fully electric BMW iX M60 and BMW iX xDrive50 vehicles, where the youths received an exclusive guided tour. They were particularly excited when Sabine Götte, Head of Qualification, Apprentice and Future Talent Programs, provided a special overview of the numerous training opportunities at the company. She answered many questions from the youths and encouraged them to confidently tackle challenges. \"For many, it's a dream to work at BMW,\" said Dr. Rebecca Gutwald, project manager at DEIN MÜNCHEN: \"Lowering the barriers and encouraging them to apply if they have this dream is something truly wonderful.\"\n\nAfter gaining insights into the history of the BMW Group and discussing training opportunities at the company, the youths headed to the basketball Bundesliga game between FCBB and Rasta Vechta at BMW Park. \"It's great that we can offer the youths something so positive - both with 'Dunks for Tomorrow' and the insight into training opportunities at the BMW Group, and the crowning conclusion that they can cheer on the FC Bayern Basketball team at BMW Park,\" said Bernd Döpke, Head of BMW Munich. A slight disappointment was that Andrea’s Obst’s team lost to Vechta by a last-second shot 77:78. However, the bitter defeat for the German champions barely dampened the spirits of the youths. \"Experiencing the game at BMW Park was really great,\" said youth ambassador Thanh.\n\nThe youths were at least able to enjoy two dunks by FC Bayern Munich Basketball. Thus, the donation amount, with which BMW supports DEIN MÜNCHEN at the end of the season, grew to over 40,000 euros by early December. For each home game dunk by the Reds, mobility partner BMW donates 1,000 euros to DEIN MÜNCHEN with the initiative \"Dunks for Tomorrow.\" The organisation helps children and youths in Munich who are growing up in social and financial risk situations and provides free access to a program offering from the areas of education, culture, and sports.\n\nDespite the defeat of FC Bayern Munich Basketball, the youths left BMW Park cheerfully heading towards their fully electric BMW iX vehicles. \"I really want to thank BMW for giving us the opportunity to have been here at BMW Park and also at the BMW Museum,\" said youth ambassador Leilani after the game. \"A great pre-Christmas gift,\" concluded Döpke, Head of BMW Munich, on the special day: \"And who knows: Maybe we'll see one or another of them again for an internship or a professional training at BMW.\"\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX M60: Power consumption combined: 24,7 kWh/100 km (62 miles) according to WLTP; CO2 emissions: 0 g/km according to WLTP;CO2 class(es): A; BMW iX xDrive50: Power consumption combined: 21,3 kWh/100 km (62 miles) according to WLTP; CO2 emissions: 0 g/km according to WLTP;CO2 class(es): A;"}

Above all, the latest generation of front collision warning with braking function provides an additional plus in safety in urban traffic. It can now also detect pedestrians and cyclists approaching parallel to the lane from behind or in front when turning, effectively helping to avoid a collision with weaker road users.

The standard centre airbag between the driver and front passenger seats was rated as highly effective.\n\nThe compact crossover model scored maximum points in the frontal offset test and the side barrier impact test for the protection of children.\n\nThe integrated safety concept provides a high level of protection against injury at all times. According to Euro NCAP, the seats and head restraints in the front and rear seats offer good protection against cervical injuries that can occur in a rear impact. The testers also emphasised the emergency braking system to prevent secondary collisions and the intelligent emergency call.\n\nActive engine compartment lids help to reduce the risk of injury to pedestrians and cyclists. The system proved to be reliable and effective at different speeds in the Euro NCAP safety test.\n\nThe ratings of the Euro NCAP testing institute are a benchmark for accident safety recognised Europe-wide and the safety level is being raised constantly. Only new vehicles that offer excellent impact protection and are also well equipped with comprehensive and practical technology for accident avoidance receive the highest rating of 5 stars.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:"}

This year’s festive campaign from BMW – titled “Das Geschenk” (The Gift) – tells the moving story of a young boy named Tim, who can think of nothing better than finding a very special treat for his beloved grandma. At the same time, the brand continues its journey to the introduction of the Neue Klasse by casting an eye back to an icon of automotive history that ushered in a new era for BMW (also under the Neue Klasse name) in the 1960s. The film at the heart of the campaign brims with feeling as it shows how Sheer Driving Pleasure brings generations together – in two different ways.\n\nThe film begins with a stroll through a festively decorated city centre. Tim and his parents are looking for a Christmas gift for his grandmother. His parents come up with one suggestion after another, each as clichéd as the last and each promptly and confidently dismissed by their seven-year-old. Eventually, in a shop window he spots the thing that will give his gran – and himself – the greatest joy. Tim’s parents are initially unconvinced, but in the end decide to go along with their son’s wishes. Tim’s grandmother opens the enormous package with her family on Christmas Eve to reveal a BMW Junior Seat children’s car seat. Both grandmother and grandson know straightaway what this means: they can now enjoy trips together in her classic BMW 1500. Because joy is the most precious gift – and the joy of driving bridges young and old.\n\nThis entertaining festive film highlights the Sheer Driving Pleasure at the core of the brand and makes the BMW 1500 – launched under the Neue Klasse umbrella more than 60 years ago – the “sleeper star” of the campaign. The film was shot in Vienna, Austria, and soundtracked by 1980s Christmas classic “Christmas In Hollis” by US hip-hop legends Run-D.M.C.\n\nSocial media cues invite the community to get involved.\n\nJung von Matt came up with the idea and concept for the latest festive campaign. The Hamburg creative agency teamed up with BMW Marketing and Munich-based production company Hochkant to produce the 100-second film, which will be shown on BMW’s YouTube, LinkedIn and Instagram channels. In addition, the film will feature on Netflix in both Germany and Great Britain. And a 60-second version of “Das Geschenk” will also be aired on free TV in Germany over the festive period.\n\nPIRO GmbH is responsible for rolling out the campaign across the brand’s social media platforms. The idea of Tim’s rather special and unconventional gift is also picked up on in a series of accompanying posts. For example, festive visuals depict car parts – wrapped up in Christmas paper – that present the community with a puzzle to solve.\n\nWhen generations meet – looking at an iconic classic with modern eyes.\n\nBoth driving pleasure and the allure of the classic BMW 1500 are universal and timeless. And a separate social media series frames these generation-spanning vibes with particular charm. Tim tries to interact with the classic car as he’s used to doing with modern vehicles, but the Neue Klasse from the 1960s lacks power windows, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant and other contemporary features. Not to worry, though, because Tim’s gran always has a trick or ruse up her sleeve to maintain the illusion, feed the young lad’s imagination and spread the feeling of pure joy.\n\nIn the event of enquiries please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nCypselus von Frankenberg, Product Communication BMW Automobiles\n\nAlexandra Landers, Head of Product and Brand Communication BMW\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2023, the BMW Group sold over 2.55 million passenger vehicles and more than 209,000 motorcycles worldwide.

This marks the end of a long and successful collaboration that began when Martin made a name for himself as a young talent in the BMW M Sports Trophy.\n\nThanks to his impressive performances in BMW M Motorsport’s customer racing programme, Martin earned his place in the works driver line-up, joining for the first time in 2013. He initially competed as a regular driver for BMW M Team RLL in the American Le Mans Series before moving to DTM from 2014 to 2017. In 2016, he celebrated victory at his home race, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), driving the BMW M6 GT3 for ROWE Racing.

In the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC), Martin, Rossi, and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) reached the podium twice this season in the LMGT3 class. This was complemented by appearances in the BMW M Hybrid V8 with BMW M Team RLL in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “On behalf of the entire BMW M Motorsport family, I would like to thank Maxime Martin for the many years we have spent together. He began his successful career in the BMW M Sports Trophy and was a key and integral part of our works driver line-up for a long time. During these years, he was one of the defining faces of our programmes, and we fondly remember the successes we achieved together in both endurance and sprint racing. However, we value not only his sporting skills but also his wonderful personality. He has been a tremendous asset to the BMW M Motorsport family in every aspect. We wish Maxime all the best for his future and look forward to seeing him again, though as a competitor, but still as a friend.”\n\nMaxime Martin: “BMW M Motorsport has played a significant role in my career from the very beginning, and I look back fondly on everything we achieved together – from my first successes in DTM and 24-hour races to the recent victories with the BMW M4 GT3. I am very grateful for the time we spent together and for my seven years as a BMW M works driver. I wish BMW M Motorsport great success in the future, and the brand will always remain a part of me.

The 2025 BMW XM Kith Concept also features an M radiator grille Iconic Glow with purple contour lighting and a paint finish enriched with purple colour pigments for the 23-inch light-alloy wheels.\n\nAs a nod to its motorsport lineage, and to pay homage to the M1’s design, the 2025 BMW XM Kith Concept has been lowered by 30 millimetres at the front and 35 millimetres at the rear, while the track on both axles has been widened by 40 millimetres. This was accomplished thanks to the use of special springs and wheel spacers.\n\nInside the concept car, M Carbon bucket seats replace the M multifunction seats of the 2025 BMW XM by Kith. They also feature surfaces with embossed Kith monogram and illuminated Kith emblems combined with the M stripes in the area of the headrests.\n\nReconstructing a legend: 1981 BMW M1 E26 by Ronnie Fieg.\n\nTo place both the concept car and the limited edition of 47 2025 BMW XM by Kith in a historical context, another unique model will be presented to the public for the first time in Miami Beach. The 1981 BMW M1 E26 by Ronnie Fieg is an extensively reconstructed one-of-one example of the sports car with specific details from the design repertoire of the Kith label.\n\nThe car, which bears the model designation, year of manufacture and internal model series code as well as the name of the Kith founder was according to Ronnie Fieg's ideas. A Techno Violet paint finish (paint code 299), the combined M and Kith emblem on the tailgate and an interior with embossed Kith lettering create new design parallels between Ronnie Fieg's 1981 BMW M1 E26 and the 2025 BMW XM Kith Concept, in addition to the similarities in the design of the production vehicles. Their joint appearance in Miami Beach thus forms a bridge between the first and the last model to be developed and produced exclusively as a BMW M in the more than 50 years of the company's history.\n\nKith for BMW: Classic BMW design motifs reinterpreted in a new fashion and lifestyle collection.\n\nThe presentation of the vehicles designed by Ronnie Fieg in Miami Beach will be accompanied by the launch of a new Kith for BMW apparel and lifestyle collection. The collection includes a wide range of products that take classic BMW design motifs and reinterpret them in Kith's signature style. In addition to the brand emblems and model inscriptions, the colours Techno Violet, Cinnabar Red and Vitality Green, which are used in the current cooperation and in previous joint projects, give the products in the collection an unmistakable look.\n\nThe apparel range includes premium jackets in Italian leather, double-sided wool and silky suede, as well as co-branded jumpers, hoodies, rugby shirts, trousers and a range of vintage-inspired T-shirts. The collection also includes a range of premium lifestyle accessories including caps and hats, key fobs and licence plates, leather driving gloves, microfibre towels and cushions, floor mats and carpets, as well as BMW and Kith branded card cases, mugs, trays, umbrellas and snowboards.\n\nA 1:18 scale model of the 2025 BMW XM by Kith is a particular highlight of the collection. In addition to the BMW Individual Frozen Techno Violet metallic body colour, the miniature features numerous other details based on the edition vehicle, including model lettering on the M radiator grille with purple trim and Kith logos on the rear doors, door sills and seats.\n\nThe scale model of the new edition vehicle will also be produced in a limited edition and can be ordered exclusively from the BMW Lifestyle Shop. The complete Kith for BMW collection will be available on December 6th at all Kith shops worldwide, including the Kith for BMW Showcase pop-up in Miami Beach, as well as online at 5 PM CET on \n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption and emission figures: BMW XM: Fuel consumption in l/100 km (62 miles) combined: 1.9 WLTP; power consumption in kWh/100 km (62 miles) combined: 33.6 WLTP; CO2 emissions in g/km combined: 43 WLTP; fuel consumption with discharged battery in l/100 km (62 miles) combined: 12.9; CO2 classes: combined weighted B, with discharged battery G.

BMW M Motorsport’s LMDh programme is getting a new addition from Formula 1 for the 2025 season. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) will become a BMW M works driver and will compete in races with the BMW M Hybrid V8 starting next year. The 32-year-old Dane has participated in a total of 185 Formula 1 races between 2014 and 2024. Further details about his future racing schedule will be announced at a later date.\n\nIn 2013, Magnussen won the Formula Renault 3.5 title. The year after, he debuted in Formula 1 and immediately secured a podium finish with a second-place result in his first season. His best championship ranking came in 2018, when he finished ninth in the drivers’ standings. He has already gained experience with sports car prototypes in 2021, completing a full season in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series), where he achieved one victory and five podium finishes in the top-class DPi category. That same year, he also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) in an LMP2 car.\n\nBMW M Motorsport fields the BMW M Hybrid V8 in both the IMSA series and the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC), which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The full driver line-up for both racing series will be announced at a later date.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Kevin Magnussen is an outstanding addition to our LMDh programme. He has regularly demonstrated his speed at the highest level in Formula 1 over the past decade. Thanks to his extensive experience, he is a true asset to our project. His previous full season with a sports car prototype in 2021 is another advantage for us, as it will surely ease his acclimatisation to the BMW M Hybrid V8. I am very delighted that Kevin Magnussen is part of the BMW M Motorsport family now.”\n\nKevin Magnussen: “I am happy and proud to represent such an iconic motorsport brand as BMW in some of the world's most legendary races. After ten years in Formula 1, I am embarking on a new and exciting chapter, and I look forward to taking on the challenge in the most innovative and advanced sports cars in the history of endurance racing. A huge thank you to BMW M Motorsport for this fantastic opportunity. I can hardly wait to start the preparations and look forward to kicking off the 2025 season with the rest of the team.”"}

Winter is making itself felt in Germany but preparations are already in full swing for the German golfing highlight that will take place next summer. From 2nd to 6th July 2025, the best golfers on the DP World Tour will meet for the BMW International Open in Munich, one of the most historic and atmospheric events on the tour calendar. At the 36th edition of the tournament, organiser BMW will once again present a fascinating field of top-class players. First on the list is a trio of German golfers that enjoys a special relationship with the BMW International Open and the Golfclub München Eichenried: Stephan Jäger, Martin Kaymer and Matti Schmid.\n\nAdvance tickets sales have already started for what is currently the only German stop on the DP World Tour calendar. As in previous years, ticket prices will be reduced by ten percent until 24th December 2024. For more information, visit the Ticket Shop: Martin Kaymer remains the only German golfer to have won the BMW International Open – and he is also the youngest winner in the history of the tournament. That is not the only reason for the two-time Major winner to be looking forward to his return to Munich. “The BMW International Open will always be one of my all-time favourite tournaments. The golf course, the fans, and the atmosphere that BMW so passionately creates, it is all just so much fun,“ said the 2008 tournament champion.\n\nHaving been away for a few years, Stephan Jäger will be returning to the place where he grew up and learned to play golf. The 35-year-old is playing the PGA TOUR and lives with his family in the USA. Concentrating exclusively on the PGA TOUR has paid off, as Jäger claimed his first tournament win in 2024 at the Texas Children’s Houston Open, pushing world no. 1 Scottie Scheffler (USA) into second place and finishing the season in an excellent 43rd position in the FedExCup rankings. “I am looking forward even more to the 2025 BMW International Open“, said the local hero. “Not many golfers get the chance to tee off in a professional tournament at their home club – especially at an event as renowned as the BMW International Open. I can hardly wait to enjoy this week back home.”\n\nAlthough his birthplace was not quite as close to Golfclub München Eichenried, the BMW International Open is still the home tournament for Bavarian golfer Matti Schmid, who has many fond memories of this course from his youth. While the 27-year-old has also established himself on the PGA TOUR, he still has his DP World Tour card and in 2021 he followed in Kaymer’s footsteps from 2007 to become the second German crowned ‘Rookie of the Year’. “The BMW International Open in my native Bavaria will always be particularly significant for me. I really enjoy playing in Munich, not least because BMW puts together a tournament experience each year that you don’t see too often in the USA or in Europe.”\n\nThe Christmas promotional discount applies to day tickets and tournament tickets, as well as for Fairway Club tickets, excluding tickets that have already been discounted. There is no general admission fee for the Pro-Am tournament (Wednesday 2nd July 2025). Children up to and including 14 years of age also enjoy free entry on all days."}

T he season finale of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS was not for the faint-hearted. In the 6-hour Endurance Cup race in Jeddah (KSA), BMW M Team WRT narrowly missed the podium with both BMW M4 GT3s. The #32 car crossed the finish line under the floodlights in fourth place, closely followed by the #46 in fifth. In the team championship standings, BMW M Team WRT is crowned champion. In the Bronze Cup, the team secured a podium finish with the #30 BMW M4 GT3, taking second place after strong comebacks from a challenging qualifying session.\n\nSheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Charles Weerts (BEL) had to fight their way forward from 24th on the grid in the #32 BMW M4 GT3. Thanks to a perfect strategy, the car was running in third place with 20 minutes remaining. However, the finish was highly turbulent following a restart after a safety car period. In the battle for the podium, debris got in front of the radiator, and Vanthoor ultimately dropped back. In the drivers’ standings of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Vanthoor and Weerts finished the season in second place, just 2.5 points behind the leaders.\n\nIn the #46 BMW M4 GT3, Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) started from 23rd and, through clever strategy by BMW M Team WRT, even briefly took the lead. From there, they were in the mix for podium contention, ultimately finishing in fifth place after the dramatic closing stages.\n\nThe ROWE Racing #998 BMW M4 GT3, which had qualified best among the BMWs with 11th place, was also performing well in the race. The trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Max Hesse (GER), and Dan Harper (GBR) were in a strong position until Harper was hit heavily in the rear during a full course yellow period. Although Harper managed to bring the BMW M4 GT3, featuring the livery of BMW M Motorsport partner MultiBank Group, back to the pits, a damage in the chassis area meant a bitter, premature end to their race.\n\nIn the drivers’ standings of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Vanthoor and Weerts finished the combined sprint and endurance season in second place, just 2.5 points behind the leaders. The team title decision remains pending as the results of a previous race have yet to be officially confirmed.\n\nIn the Bronze Cup, Jens Klingmann (GER), Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), and Sam De Haan (GBR) also staged a comeback in the #30 BMW M4 GT3, starting from eighth place and finishing second on the podium after six thrilling hours of racing. Unfortunately, the Paradine Competition #991 BMW M4 GT3 from Century Motorsport retired after just one hour due to a technical defect while being driven by Toby Sowery (GBR). Sowery and his teammates Jake Dennis and Darren Leung (both GBR) had qualified third in the Bronze category. Leung, Harper and Paradine Competition had previously won the drivers’ and team titles in the Bronze category at the Barcelona (ESP) sprint finale.\n\nSuccesses in the GT4 European Series.\n\nAt the GT4 European Series finale, also held in Jeddah over the weekend, BMW M Motorsport teams again had reasons to celebrate. Ricardo van der Ende (NED) and Benjamin Lessenes (BEL) claimed second place overall and in the Silver class in the second of two races with the #17 BMW M4 GT4 from L’Espace Bienvenue. They finished third in the final Silver class championship standings. Pedro Carvalho Ebrahim (BRA) from Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport earned the “Rookie of the Year” award. In the Am category, Antoni de Barn and Jean-Mathieu Leandri (both FRA) drove the #317 BMW M4 GT4 from Team Chazel Technologie Course to second place in their class in both races.\n\nQuotes after the Jeddah season finale:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “We all expected a spectacular season finale in Jeddah – and that’s exactly what we got. Congratulations to the BMW M Team WRT, which stands at the top of the overall team standings in the GT World Challenge Europe after a long season. In practice and qualifying, our BMW M4 GT3s struggled a bit on the tight street circuit, but once again, the race pace was very strong. Add to that the right strategic decisions in a race with multiple yellow and safety car periods. A podium in the Pro class would have been well deserved, but positions were reshuffled in the final phase. With car number 32, we were on a secure podium position and thus on track for the title, but then, unfortunately, debris got in front of the radiator, and we lost positions in the first laps after the safety car. I am confident the #998 from ROWE Racing would have also been in contention for the podium if it hadn’t been forced to retire early through no fault of its own. That is racing, but I think everyone can be proud of what they did. Congratulations to the crew of the #30 car for another Bronze podium finish after their fantastic overall win at Monza. I want to thank all the teams and drivers for their hard work and dedication this season. I also want to congratulate our customer racing teams in the GT4 European Series, who rose to the challenge of Jeddah magnificently.”\n\nVincent Vosse, Team Principal BMW M Team WRT: “As we say, a hard one to swallow. The last 20 minutes were a bit crazy. We were fighting for P2, giving us the Overall Drivers and Endurance Teams championships, on top of the Overall Teams’ title. At the end, due to debris we got in the radiator, we had to slow down. We lost three positions, and two titles. Anyway, we finish second in the Overall Drivers championship, 2.5 points behind Maro Engel and Lucas Auer. Congrats to them. In the end, we are still Overall (Sprint and Endurance) Teams champions, which is a great reward! It was a tough season but a good one. We had some ups and downs, but we will remember the exceptional win of car 30 in Monza. It was a special and incredible one with a 1-2 finish. This is what I will remember from the Endurance Championship!”\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf, Team Principal ROWE Racing: “It’s somewhat symbolic that this season ends like this. It started perfectly with the Le Castellet victory, but after that, we had a lot of bad luck with retirements, tyre failures, unavoidable contacts, and accidents. The performance was always there, and we could fight at the front, but you can’t control such things. It’s tough for the team; you feel powerless. Even though you’re doing a good job, the results are missing. The team had to endure a lot, but the fact that we still managed to deliver every time and once again fought for the title until the very last race of the season shows how strong our team is.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 4th place): “It has been my first time in Jeddah as for everybody here. The weekend was quite eventful weekend. We were lacking a bit of pace during the different practice sessions and in qualifying. We made a good step for the race, we had a great car. It was nice to drive! We had good fights and we had a shot at the podium. It’s a shame that we lost it in the last moments but that’s part of racing. Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes not. Overall we can say it was a good race where we showed again the potential of the BMW M4 GT3 and where we gained 20 positions. It’s a good way to finish the season even though I believe a podium would have been deserved.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 5th place): “It was a very good race for us because we started from P23 and were able to arrive in the top five at the end and we were fighting for the podium until the last lap. I think that we worked very well this weekend and we were able to improve. From the season in general, I expected more, especially as our line-up is great with Raffaele Marciello and Maxime Martin. I think that often we had a good speed but we were a bit unlucky. We had good races, we won, we got some podiums. We were not able to achieve a podium in an endurance race, that was the target. But in the end, it was a good season.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#30 OQ by Oman Racing BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, 2nd place Bronze Cup): “I am happy that we have brought the car home in P2. It is very difficult to drive on this track because the walls don’t leave margin for any errors. This was a huge challenge. We got a penalty for track limits which is very critical on this track but we managed to come back from that. That was the key to this race and we finished in the highest position we could aim for. I think that P1 was never in our reach. The winners were just too strong tonight so we maximised our result. It was good fun and we enjoy being on the podium on such a difficult street circuit. In this season, we had ups and downs. The longer the season went, the better we got. The highlight was the overall victory at Monza that no one can take from us and which was the first time in history. It’s been good season in a highly contested GT3 championship, so I am still very proud. Thanks to the whole team for the support and effort. It has been a pure joy.”\n\nDan Harper (#998 BMW M4 GT3, ROWE Racing, DNF): “After a difficult weekend up until qualifying we were happy with P11 in qualifying. Augusto did a great job in the beginning because it is obviously so tight here. A lot can happen. He stayed clean and gained a couple of positions. It was perfect. Unfortunately then when I got in the car was a full course yellow very quickly. I was just settling into the rhythm. Coming from turn three into four, the car in front of me braked for the countdown so I also braked at the same point as him. But then from behind I got hit. I have been never hit so hard in my life actually, so it kind of hurt initially but thankfully I’m okay now. But the car couldn’t continue, the suspension was broken. It’s just a shame for everybody. Obviously it’s a long way to come here. And it’s a cool race so it’s a shame that it ended early for us.”\n\nToby Sowery (#991 BMW M4 GT3, Paradine Competition by Century Motorsport, DNF): “I think it’s a difficult track for everyone and a lot of drivers had never driven here before so it was a learning curve. All in all, the BMWs had a strong package here at the weekend and it’s proven well in the race. I think one lap was in favour of other cars but in race pace, we have been the car to beat. It’s a shame because we were looking super strong. But that’s racing.”\n\nNote to editors: Footage and interviews from the 6 Hours of Jeddah of the Fanatec GT World Challenge powered by AWS and the season finale of the GT4 European Series are available for editorial use at the following link:"}

With the BMW R 12 S, BMW Motorrad is expanding its Heritage range with a fitting tribute to the iconic R 90 S, which in 1973 not only set a sporty exclamation mark for BMW Motorrad with 67 hp and a top speed of 200 km/h in terms of riding dynamics.\n\nMoreover, the then Chief Designer Hans A. Muth skillfully expressed the sporty ambitions in the design language and sent the BMW R 90 S, as the world's first production motorcycle, with a handlebar fairing designed according to aerodynamic aspects and a red-laid \"90\" in the R 90 S emblem of the engine, successfully into the race for the buyers' favor.\n\nRacing successes helped the BMW R 90 S to achieve an iconic image.It did not take long for the image of the R 90 S to also benefit from racing successes. For example, at the Production TT on the Isle of Man, where Hans-Otto Butenuth and Helmut Dähne celebrated a class victory in 1976. In the same year, Steve McLaughlin also won the prestigious 200 Miles of Daytona, and his teammate Reg Pridmore became the first AMA Superbike Champion in history. Also for this reason, an R 90 S is today, as it was then, one of the particularly sought-after BMW motorcycles.\n\nThe BMW R 12 S transfers the spirit of the R 90 S into the here and now.More than the Concept Ninety study presented by BMW Motorrad in May 2013, the new BMW R 12 S takes up the spirit of the R 90 S in its overall concept as well as in many details and transfers it skillfully into the present day. Based on the R 12 nineT, it embodies an authentic and sporty retro bike and utilizes several ingredients that make up a skillful homage to the R 90 S.\n\n\"The defining design elements of our R 12 S include the handlebar-mounted cockpit fairing with the tinted windshield, the seat with contrast stitching, and the Lavaorange metallic paint finish as a nod to the legendary R 90 S Daytona Orange from 1975. The design is perfectly complemented by details such as the red-laid 'S' on the side covers, the red double line, and the brushed and clear-lacquered aluminum surfaces of the tank and seat hump,\" explains Alexander Buckan, Head of BMW Motorrad Design.\n\nGenerous standard equipment with Option 719 Wheel Classic II, Billet packs Shadow and Shadow II, Headlight Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, and much more.The claim to a sporty retro bike is underlined by the R 12 S with numerous standard product features such as the Option 719 Classic II wheels with wire spokes and shiny, naturally anodized aluminum rims, as well as other high-quality components. The handlebars and fork tubes are in black, and the components of the Billet packs Shadow and Shadow II set particularly high-quality technical accents. Components of the Billet pack Shadow are the left and right ignition coil covers, the oil filler screw, and the cylinder head covers coated in Avus black metallic matt. The Billet pack Shadow II includes the footrest system including foot brake and gear shift levers, the pillion footrests, the hand brake and clutch levers, the expansion tank covers for the front brake and clutch, as well as the handlebar end mirrors.\n\nFurther standard features include the Comfort Package, which includes Hill Start Control, Shift Assistant Pro, Heated Grips, and Cruise Control. For even more safety during night rides, the adaptive cornering light Headlight Pro ensures better illumination of the road in corners.\n\nComprehensive program of optional equipment from the factory and Original BMW Motorrad Aaccessories for customization.The BMW R 12 S is based on the BMW R 12 nineT, and therefore all accessory products such as titanium exhaust systems, soft bags, or the navigation preparation can also be used for this motorcycle. For example, the already expressive dynamism of the lines can be further enhanced with the short rear end, which is available as anOriginal BMW Motorrad Accessory, and the black license plate holder attached to the swingarm. Additional factory-installed options are also available, such as Tire Pressure Control (RDC), Anti-Theft Alarm System (DWA), Intelligent Emergency Call, Connected Ride Control, and the digital display with micro-TFT display as an alternative to the classic round instruments."}

The BMW Group and its joint venture Encory are building a Cell Recycling Competence Centre (CRCC) for battery cells in Kirchroth, in the Straubing-Bogen district of Lower Bavaria, where it will implement a process referred to as “direct recycling”. This innovative procedure enables residual materials from battery cell production, as well as whole battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled into their valuable components. The recovered raw materials are then directly reused in pilot production of battery cells at the company’s own Battery Cell Competence Centres.\n\n“The new Cell Recycling Competence Centre brings another element to our in-house expertise: From development and pilot production to recycling, we are creating a closed loop for battery cells,” says Markus Fallböhmer, SVP Battery Production at BMW AG, “taking advantage of the short distances between our Competence Centres in Bavaria.” The BMW Group is investing around 10 million euros in construction of the new Competence Centre. Installation work at the building is already scheduled to begin in the second half of 2025. Once completed, validation of the recycling method in near-series processes will get underway.\n\nInnovative direct recycling recovers valuable raw materials\n\nBattery cell raw materials – primarily lithium and cobalt, but also graphite, manganese, nickel and copper – are among the main cost factors in cell production. Responsible use of these resources is essential from both environmental and economic perspectives. “The direct recycling will help reducing the costs for our battery cell pilot line”, explains Fallböhmer. Unlike conventional methods, the main characteristic of direct recycling is that raw materials from battery cells are not reverted to their original state, but are instead fed back “directly” into the cell production cycle. This method dispenses with the previously common energy-intensive chemical or thermal processing. The recycling method was developed by BMW Group experts at the Competence Centres in Munich and Parsdorf. At the new CRCC, it will be implemented on a larger scale and, once the processes are finalised, battery cell material in the mid-double-digit tonne range can be recycled per year.\n\nOptimal location for new Competence Centre in Bavaria\n\nThe BMW Group consolidates its battery cell expertise at its Competence Centres in Munich and Parsdorf. The Battery Cell Competence Centre (BCCC) in the north of Munich offers state-of-the-art labs and research facilities for developing the battery cells for next-generation high-voltage batteries and producing them in small quantities. The most promising battery cell from the BCCC will be scaled up for series processes on a pilot line at the Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf. Once completed, recycling of surplus material from pilot production in Parsdorf will take place at the new Competence Centre in Kirchroth. The recovered raw materials will then be reused in cell production in Parsdorf. This ensures short distances between all Competence Centres and prevents valuable raw materials from being lost. Following on from the BCCC and CMCC, the CRCC thus represents the next step in the BMW Group’s battery cell strategy on the road to the circular economy.\n\nJoint venture operates Competence Center, intellectual property at the BMW Group\n\nThe new CRCC, spanning an area of 2,200 m², will be integrated into the expansion of an existing building in the Kirchroth-Nord industrial park, near Straubing. Electrical energy from the discharged cells will be captured in energy storage systems within the building and used to operate the recycling systems. The energy concept will be rounded out by photovoltaic systems installed on the roof of the building. While the intellectual property for the recycling method is fully owned by the BMW Group – the Competence Centre will be built and operated by Encory GmbH. As a joint venture of the BMW Group and Interzero Group, Encory develops and implements logistics and consulting solutions in areas such as collection, recycling, and remanufacturing of vehicle components. Both partners hold a 50% stake in the company. Around 20 people will be employed in the new Competence Center.\n\nCircular economy at the BMW Group\n\nThe BMW Group views the circular economy as one of the key issues in designing more resource-efficient vehicles. The premise is to optimize the circularity of materials. This means resources are not lost, but retain their value for long-term use. The BMW Group applies the principles of Re:Think, Re:Duce, Re:Use and Re:Cycle. From vehicle design and production, to recycling and reuse, everything is geared towards ensuring cars can serve as a source of raw materials for new vehicles at the end of their use phase. Recycling focuses, in particular, on the use of innovative methods to recover high-voltage batteries from electrified vehicles."}

The BMW Group is systematically advancing the digitalisation and automation of its production processes within the BMW iFACTORY framework. Since 2022, the company has been testing Automated Driving In-Plant (AFW) for new vehicles at its largest European plant in Dingolfing. Following successful CE certification, the pilot project is now transitioning into series operation. In addition to Dingolfing, Leipzig is also currently being enabled to implement the AFW project in series operation. Other facilities in the BMW Group production network are set to follow in stages.\n\n“Automated Driving In-Plant optimises our production process and delivers significant efficiency gains for our logistics,” explains Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production. “That is why we will be swiftly rolling out this technology throughout our production network.”\n\nIn addition to the BMW 5 Series and 7 Series in Dingolfing, this technology is now also being used for the MINI Countryman and other BMW models in Leipzig. In Dingolfing the new vehicles drive fully autonomously – without a driver – along a route of more than one kilometre, from the two assembly halls, through the “short test course”, to the plant’s finishing area. This is made possible by sensors installed along the route – creating the largest LIDAR infrastructure in Europe – and relying on an externally generated environment model and an external movement planner. Regardless of the vehicle's equipment options, this system controls its automated movements, using state-of-the-art cloud architecture. Parts of the technology were provided by the young Swiss company Embotech AG, which the BMW Group already cooperated with in the early stages through its venture client unit, the BMW START-UP Garage.\n\nPlant Leipzig plans to introduce automated driving for around 90 percent of the BMW and MINI models built there, with Plants Regensburg and Oxford set to follow in 2025. The new site in Debrecen, Hungary, will also implement this technology from the official launch of series production.\n\nGoing forward, the BMW Group plans to expand its use of Automated Driving In-Plant to other areas of production, such as for driving through the testing zone and in outdoor distribution areas. Production and development experts are also working closely together to refine the technology in-house. Another key factor in expanding the technology is the increasing use of on-board technology, which will support the external sensors in the long term.\n\n“Over the next ten years, we will log several million test kilometres with Automated Driving In-Plant in our production network alone,” says Nedeljković. “In this way, the BMW Group is once again setting a new benchmark for automation and digitalisation of its production processes – while paving the way for future applications in the field of autonomous driving.”"}

With vehicles now approaching series maturity, all logistics and production processes at the plant are being tested and constantly optimised under real conditions to ensure a smooth start of series production.\n\nOn the road to series production\n\nThe integration of new models in a plant starts with the production of near-series vehicles – an important step for the preparation of series production in Debrecen. As part of this process, test vehicles cycle through all production steps. This also means that all logistics processes, manufacturing equipment and operations performed by employees at the plant already have to function smoothly. These operations are just as complex as in actual series production. Despite the limited number of parts involved, they must still be made available in the appropriate logistics processes.\n\nMaterials and vehicle parts are delivered daily to Plant Debrecen, with test vehicles coming off the production line on a continuous basis. Every part and every production step is closely scrutinised. Special attention is paid to validation of cutting-edge production systems and tools, including their digital connectivity.\n\nRunning system tests for the future vehicle model helps identify further potential for optimisation. In the coming months, the focus will be on refining processes, based on the insights gained.\n\nDuring this phase, new staff will also undergo intensive training on the installations and machinery. Close cooperation across all areas of production will ensure operations are seamlessly integrated for a smooth and successful series launch.\n\n*Since this is a pre-production model, consumption data for the X model of the Neue Klasse is not available at this time."}

In an edition that has been marked by the memory of the victims of the DANA, solidarity and fraternity have been the axis around which the whole gala, presided by Her Majesty Queen Sofía, has revolved. The presentation was followed by a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony by the Orquesta de Radio y Televisión Española, a work that represents the values of fraternity and brotherhood, with the introduction and words of the actress and film director Paz Vega. A large representation of diplomats from European countries attended the event, given its content and purpose, dedicated to brotherhood between nations.\n\nThe jury, composed by prominent art professionals such as the internationally renowned painter and sculptor Antonio López, the director of the Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao, formerly director of the Museo del Prado, Miguel Zugaza, the founder and president of the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Patrizia Sandretto, the artistic director of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, Guillermo Solana, and the director of the Carasso Foundation, Lucía Casani, selected the two winners in a year that saw record participation with over 1.700 artists.\n\nThis year BMW Group Spain turned the artistic celebration into a symbolic act of solidarity and commitment, and made an extraordinary contribution of 500.000 euros to the Queen Sofía Foundation for the victims of the DANA, in addition to the additional donation of 25.000 euros linked to the annual concert, which this year will go to the Food Bank to support children's food needs in the most affected areas. According to the President of the BMW Group in Spain and Portugal, Manuel Terroba, \"this catastrophe has put our values to the test as an immense generosity has made its way through multiple gestures that show tireless energy, dedication and most important of all, hope. Hope in human beings because most of this wave of solidarity was made up of young people, many of them students, who did not hesitate to exchange their books for a shovel and a rake to lend a hand”.\n\nThe ceremony was held at the Teatro Real in Madrid and, as on previous occasions, was presided over by Her Majesty Queen Sofía, who reaffirmed her commitment to the development of artistic talent in Spain. Queen Sofía was accompanied by a large group of representatives of European embassies in Spain, given the content and purpose of the Gala. Among the diplomats present were representatives of nations such as Germany, Greece, Sweden, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia, among others.\n\nDuring the gala, the President of the BMW Group in Spain and Portugal, Manuel Terroba, emphasised that the “Premio BMW de Pintura continues consolidating its position as an international benchmark, with the participation of 39 different nationalities. This shows that this award is positioning itself as a global showcase for contemporary art, an art that transcends borders. More and more artists are finding in these awards a platform to show their work to the world”.\n\nThis year, the Premio BMW de Pintura reached an all-time high in terms of participation, with more than 1.700 artists from 39 nationalities. Particularly noteworthy was the increase in the representation of women, accounting almost 45% of the participants, reflecting the growing diversity and richness of perspectives that enrich the contemporary art scene.\n\nMusical tribute to the fraternity As is tradition, the evening included a moving musical tribute under the concept of SinfonIA, representing harmony in an ever-changing world. The event was presented by the actress and film director Paz Vega and was conducted by the RTVE Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Christoph König. The BMW Group chose for the occasion a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, a work symbolising brotherhood and hope, and a tribute to solidarity. Those attending the gala, along with the finalist artists, were privileged to enjoy the captivating voices of the RTVE Choir, which accompanied the orchestra of more than 160 artists.

With the publication of its first environmental impact report, the new BMW Group Competence Center for Battery Cell Manufacturing (CMCC) in Parsdorf has been awarded EMAS certification. The acronym EMAS stands for European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, which claims to be the most stringent environmental management system in the world. The certification was presented to Bernd Wächtershäuser, Director of the CMCC in Parsdorf, on 18 November. Speaking during a visit by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) for Munich and Upper Bavaria, Wächtershäuser said: “We are very pleased to receive this award, which underlines the fact that our processes operate on a very high level, in both economic and environmental terms. The entire team has done an excellent job in achieving this certification.”\n\nThe CMCC in Parsdorf is where the BMW Group manufactures prototype cells of the kind that will be used in the Neue Klasse models from 2025. It is also a manifestation of the company’s pioneering role in battery cell technology. “Economic success and sustainable operations are not a contradiction,” said Manfred Gößl, Managing Director of the IHK for Munich and Upper Bavaria at the presentation of the certificate. “Quite the opposite, in fact – as is evidenced by every facility pursuing EMAS certification. The IHK would like to congratulate the BMW Group Competence Centre in Parsdorf on this milestone.”\n\nCMCC Parsdorf: Efficient operations, and concepts for the cell cycle\n\nThe EMAS certification underlines the rigorous environmental standards that govern operations at the CMCC in Parsdorf. Its technical systems for battery cell production have been subject to an immission control approval procedure, and the site was found to meet all requirements and specifications. The CMCC is powered by non-fossil energy from 100% renewable sources. Natural gas was deliberately rejected as a source of power, and the building is instead supplied with regenerative heat thanks to state-of-the-art groundwater and air source heat pumps. Hot water for process ventilation is obtained highly efficiently, via the waste heat from various primary processes. “Pilot production focuses on reducing consumption of critical raw materials and energy, avoiding solvents and developing innovative approaches to support circular raw materials for batteries,” Wächtershäuser explained. Raw materials are a significant cost factor in cell production, so using them efficiently and responsibly is essential in terms of both economic and environmental considerations. The CMCC in Parsdorf is also helping the BMW Group learn more about how to further optimise the use of resources. Wherever technically feasible, residual materials generated during the production process are fed into the material loop. Active materials incorporate a significant share of recyclates.\n\nEMAS certification: Strict requirements and high environmental standards\n\nTo obtain EMAS certification, businesses must fulfil stringent requirements and comply with rigorous environmental standards. EMAS is a globally recognised standard that helps companies to manage and continuously improve their environmental impact. A key part of the EMAS environmental management system consists of the international environmental management standard ISO 14001. EMAS also focuses on measurable improvements, transparency and legal security. The aim of the certification is to help companies continuously improve their environmental performance, for example by using energy and material more efficiently and reducing emissions, wastewater and waste from their sites. Besides these direct environmental impacts, EMAS focuses on indirect aspects, such as the environmental compatibility of products, procurement and supply chains, contractors’ conduct, and recording and evaluating the impact of employees commuting to work.\n\n(Source: \n\nHow a battery cell is made: The stages of prototype production at the CMCC\n\nCell production at CMCC in Parsdorf starts with the manufacture of the electrode. The basic materials – including graphite for the anode and nickel oxides for the cathode – are dosed and mixed with binders and solvents in exact ratios to create what’s known as slurry. This is then used to coat wafer-thin metal foils and compress them after drying, in a process known in the business as calendering. In calendering, maximum precision is vital, as the foil is just a few micrometres thick, thinner than the threads of a spider’s web, and the coating is also in the micrometre range. The coated foils – or calendered electrodes – then move on to cell assembly, where they are wound into “jelly rolls” with the separator and inserted into the cell housing. The cells are then filled with electrolyte, charged for the first time and tested for function and quality.\n\nParsdorf prototypes: New cell format and advanced cell chemistry\n\nBattery cells determine the key characteristics of electric vehicles: range, mileage and charging time. The new cylindrical cell by BMW is specially designed for the electric architecture of the Neue Klasse models and can significantly increase range by up to 30 percent (according to WLTP) – possibly even more, depending on the model. It has a uniform diameter of 46 millimetres and comes in two different heights: 95 and 120 millimetres. The nickel content is higher than that of BMW’s fifth-generation battery cells and the cobalt content is lower. On the anode side, the silicon content is higher, meaning an increase in volumetric energy density in the cell of more than 20 percent. The high-voltage battery, drive and charging technology of the Neue Klasse will have a higher voltage of 800 volts. One advantage of this is that it optimises the feed-in of energy at DC fast-charging stations.\n\nTransparent reporting: Environmental impact statement now online"}

One year ago, the BMW Group announced plans to build a new battery testing centre at the Wackersdorf location. Now, the initial phase has come on-stream as planned. Scheduled for completion in late 2025, the site, which spans over 8,000 square metres, will rigorously test individual battery cells, complete high-voltage batteries and other electric powertrain components for future BMW Group models early in development, well before they go into production.\n\nThe investment of around 100 million euros has primarily focused on complex test-bench technology and the upgrades to the building's existing infrastructure required for operation. Hall 80, located on the grounds of the Wackersdorf plant, has been remodelled for this purpose: Originally constructed in the 1980s for a planned reprocessing facility, the building has quite a history.\n\nIn recent months, structural work for the new battery testing centre has been in progress, including installation of a new floor slab. A total of 2,200 tonnes of structural steel and 10,000 cubic metres of concrete were used in the expansion.\n\nThe commissioning of the initial section means that the so-called “battery testers” will be operating around the clock to test battery cells during the early phase of development. Essentially, the electrical performance of individual battery cells is determined during charging and discharging under different conditions. This allows use cases that will be relevant for customers later to be simulated, long before a vehicle under development drives on the road.\n\n“Parallel testing of several hundred battery cells will initially be possible. Once the ramp-up is complete, testing capacity will reach several thousand battery cells,” explains Project Manager Dr Felix Schmidt-Stein. In the final phase from 2025 onwards, the testing centre will also be used to validate the BMW Group’s battery-electric vehicles prior to the official launch of series production and ensure the required premium quality. “For example, this includes subjecting the batteries to vibration and shock tests,” adds Schmidt-Stein. “We can also simulate complex driving patterns in endurance tests, including charging and discharging cycles. Tests like these are essential for type approval of electric vehicles.”\n\n“Commissioning of the first phase of the new battery testing centre means that the BMW Group's Wackersdorf location is poised to become a major facilitator in the transformation towards electromobility,” confirms Site Manager Christoph Peters. “The new battery testing centre gives our site a broader foundation. We are now adding a fourth pillar in Wackersdorf – in addition to supplying our overseas plants, cockpit production and door production for Rolls-Royce models. This represents a strong commitment to the future of the site.” \n\nBMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf\n\nThe BMW Group has viewed itself for decades as the benchmark for production technology and operational excellence in vehicle construction – including at its locations in Regensburg and Wackersdorf. The BMW Group vehicle plant in Regensburg has been in operation since 1986 and is one of more than 30 BMW Group production locations worldwide. A total of up to 1,400 vehicles of the BMW X1 and BMW X2 models come off the production line at Plant Regensburg every workday – destined for customers all over the world. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on a single production line – from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids, to fully-electric models.\n\nHigh-voltage batteries for the electric models built in Regensburg are also produced locally, in direct proximity to the vehicle plant. They are assembled at the electric component production facility, which opened in 2021 at the Leibnizstrasse location.\n\nBMW Innovation Park Wackersdorf also belongs to the Regensburg site. The 55-hectare campus built in the 1980s was originally intended as a nuclear reprocessing facility. The BMW Group has located its cockpit production there, as well as its parts supply for overseas plants. In addition to BMW as the largest employer, several other companies are also based at Innovation Park Wackersdorf. A total of around 2,500 employees work there. The BMW Group core staff at the Regensburg and Wackersdorf locations in eastern Bavaria is made up of around 9,250 employees, including more than 300 apprentices."}

The 56th edition of the legendary Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix concluded with another all-BMW podium – once again, the BMW M 1000 RR proved to be the bike to beat on the Guia Circuit. However, the weekend unfolded quite differently from what participants had hoped. Torrential rain initially caused significant schedule delays and ultimately led to the cancellation of the race on the narrow street circuit. As a result, the victory trophies were awarded based on the top three qualifiers: BMW M 1000 RR riders Davey Todd (GBR), Erno Kostamo (FIN), and Peter Hickman (GBR).\n\nThe stage was set for an exciting Macau weekend with a strong BMW lineup. FHO Racing BMW Motorrad fielded Todd, Hickman, Macau record-holder Michael Rutter (GBR), and Craig Neve (GBR) at Team Principal Faye Ho’s home round. Together, Hickman (four) and Rutter (nine) boast a total of 13 Macau victories. Finland’s Erno Kostamo, the 2022 winner, competed with Team 38 Motorsport by Penz13 Racing. In total, seven BMW racers travelled to Macau to take on the unique challenges of this iconic event.\n\nDue to inclement weather, they had to wait until Saturday before hitting the track. After a free practice session, qualifying was held with BMW M 1000 RR riders claiming the top four spots: Todd ahead of Kostamo, Hickman, and Rutter. Heavy rain on Sunday morning made racing impossible, so the top three qualifiers were awarded podium honours. Todd also received the trophy for the fastest lap.\n\nReactions after the Macau Grand Prix.\n\nDavey Todd, FHO Racing BMW Motorrad: “This year’s Macau Grand Prix has been a hectic one from start to finish. It has been a real shame about the weather but what can we do? It is out of everybody’s control. The organisers have done the best job as they possibly can. We have been super unlucky with the typhoons that came in this week. To qualify on pole which turned out to be the win is pretty cool. We had to FHO riders on the podium here at their home race. It’s great to do that for the FHO Racing BMW Motorrad team. I am really pleased to start off my relationship with the team like this.”\n\nPeter Hickman, FHO Racing BMW Motorrad: “It has just been one of them, hasn’t it? Everything has been against us. At least I got the full set now, I got a first, a second and a third place trophy now, bronze, silver and gold. But like Davey said, it’s good for Faye and the FHO Racing BMW Motorrad team. We’ve been both at the front row yesterday which turned out to be the race result in the end. For me personally, I am not really a qualifying person, I always look forward to a race, as we all do of course. But this wasn’t to be this year.

Mixed emotions for the BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers after the #FIA GT World Cup in #Macau (CHN). Throughout much of the weekend, the pace of the four BMW M4 GT3s on the Guia Circuit was very strong, culminating in a one-two finish for Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in Saturday's qualification race. Consequently, the duo started the main race from the front row. However, under very challenging conditions due to the rain, they were unable to capitalise on the strengths of their cars. Both were eliminated following incidents. This time, it was Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) who celebrated on the podium, finishing second and third, respectively.\n\nOverall, despite the two podium finishes, the disappointment over the missed victory in the main race prevailed due to the course of events on Sunday. Marciello and Vanthoor initially defended first and second places, but it quickly became clear that other cars coped better with the wet conditions than the BMW M4 GT3, whose performance had already been reduced compared to the competition after qualifying on Friday. Vanthoor came under pressure from the eventual winner Maro Engel (GER, Mercedes), who hit him in the rear during an overtaking attempt and pushed him into the barriers. As a result, Vanthoor's race was over. Marciello fought with Antonio Fuoco (ITA, Ferrari) for the lead. Both cars engaged in a tough duel, which ended with a slight collision and a slide into the runoff area for both.\n\nDue to the incidents, Farfus and van der Linde advanced from starting positions five and six to the front and were able to celebrate on the podium. Farfus reached the podium last year, finishing third, and for van der Linde, it was his first podium at his second Macau start. The weekend was also special for the South African for another reason. He competed in a special design in the style of Chinese Manhua comics, developed by BMW M Motorsport together with Premium Technology Partner Shell. It featured a dragon and van der Linde as an animated character. This character was also available on-site as merchandise for guests and fans.\n\nComments on the FIA GT World Cup:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We have shown that we had four incredibly strong cars at the start – with top teams and great support. Occupying the front row and having all four cars in the top-six showcased our strong performance. There was an adjustment to the balance of performance for the BMW M4 GT3 before the qualification race, but we still managed to defend our very good starting positions and win the race. In the main race, it became clear that our car was not the fastest and we fell back. Unfortunately, there was also an incident between Maro Engel and Dries Vanthoor, which in our view was not appropriately penalised, resulting in Dries' race ending prematurely while he was in third place. Of course, it's a great result to have two cars on the podium with Augusto Farfus and Sheldon van der Linde. But when you compete here, you want to win the race. And I believe we had arguably the strongest line-up, but not the chance to win.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#89 BMW M4 GT3, Team KRC, 2nd place main race, 5th place qualification race): “Macau is always a surprise package. I drove for a new team, a team from Macau, which makes me very proud. BMW M Motorsport has supported us as a small team very well, which is great. We worked closely together, and now I'm back on the podium. This weekend was probably the toughest I've had in Macau, with all kinds of weather conditions and situations. The weather played a big role this time. A dry race would certainly have produced a different result but I am very satisfied with what I have achieved.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 BMW M4 GT3, Team WRT, 3rd place main race, 6th place qualification race): “This is my first podium in Macau. Of course, it's a special feeling, especially after I was third last year and lost the podium in the last five laps due to a tyre puncture so it feels good, even if it was somewhat unexpected before the race. When you start from sixth place, you don't really expect to make up three positions in Macau. I had a lot of pressure from behind with the two Porsches, which were flying in the rain. It was very difficult to keep them behind me. But I knew if I got out of the Melco corner well, they couldn't attack. I'm very proud to stand on the podium here. It's a nice reward for all the work we've done over the past two years, which hasn't really been rewarded yet.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#1 BMW M4 GT3, TORO Racing powered by MCG, DNF main race, 1st place qualification race): “The weekend started very well, we were in the best position. It's a shame how the main race went. Unfortunately, we had the worst conditions for our car today, but we were only two laps away from victory. I lost the lead in the last corner against the Ferrari, but tried to counter immediately. Of course, I was late, but he also changed line under braking, and then I had no more space. I put everything on one card, but unfortunately, it didn't work out today.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#32 BMW M4 GT3, Team WRT, DNF main race, 2nd place qualification race): “It was a very good Friday and a very good Saturday. We finished the qualification race in second after even leading. But today I am very disappointed. If you push another car off, you should not be able to win the race. For me it is a no-go what happened today – but it is what it is, it happened. We had good fun and showed that BMW is competitive and showed a good fight, but unfortunately, there are some things out of our control.”"}

These include the red-white-black John Cooper Works logo in the style of a checkered flag from motorsports, as well as a JCW-specific Multitone Roof with a red-black color gradient. Black side skirts, model-specific aeroblades at the C-pillar, and the accentuated rear spoiler optimize the aerodynamics for increased range. The three-door MINI John Cooper Works Electric achieves 371 kilometers, while the five-door MINI John Cooper Works Aceman can drive up to 355 kilometers on a single battery charge.\n\nThe large octagonal high-gloss black front grille with wide air vents for efficient engine cooling and the modern JCW logo dominates the front view of both models. Red-colored inserts in the side air inlets on the front apron underscore the motorsport-oriented design for maximum performance. In the center of the black rear diffuser, the centrally positioned tailpipe emphasizes the character of the two top athletes.\n\nThis performance is also reflected in the powerful appearance of the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman ALL4. In the front view, aerodynamic elements with red reflectors emphasize the wide stance, while at the rear of the vehicle, vertical taillights with the John Cooper Works Signature Mode frame the upright body. Advanced assistance systems support the driver through progressive technologies. For the first time, the MINI Countryman offers partially automated Level 2 driving on highway-like routes, providing additional comfort.\n\nPuristic Interior with motorsport accents. The clear design of the interior in the new MINI John Cooper Works models is characterized by JCW-specific equipment details in red and black. The black JCW sports steering wheel with red decorative stitching and a six o'clock spoke made of black and red fabric provides excellent grip. The JCW sports seats offer secure support during dynamic driving. The combination of black leatherette with multi-colored knitted material in the shoulder area and red accent stitching picks up the color pattern of the knitted surface of the dashboard. In all MINI John Cooper Works models, the brilliant sound of the exclusive Harman Kardon sound system enhances the driving experience as standard.\n\nAdvanced technology for maximum and comfortable driving pleasure. The JCW-specific go-kart mode expands the selection options of the MINI Experience Modes in the vehicles of the new MINI John Cooper Works family with additional motorsport flair. The steering is set to a more direct setting, the accelerator pedal responds faster to commands for increased driving fun. Accordingly, the high-resolution OLED display provides additional performance-related data such as torque, power output, and current g-force.\n\nFor all MINI John Cooper Works models, the Digital Key Plus provides a convenient digital vehicle key on the smartphone. This allows the vehicle to be comfortably unlocked or locked without having to pick up the smartphone. For the MINI John Cooper Works Electric as well as the MINI John Cooper Works Aceman, the Remote Parking function also offers a convenient option to park and unpark the vehicle via the smartphone.\n\nLong racing tradition with legendary successes. The history of MINI John Cooper Works dates back to the year 1961. The John Cooper recognized the competitive potential of the classic Mini long before anyone else. By installing a more powerful engine, new brakes, and a more direct steering, he turned the modest small car into a race car that made the giants of the rally scene tremble in the 1960s. The three overall victories at the legendary Rallye Monte Carlo in 1964, 1965, and 1967 are among the absolute highlights of the classic Mini's racing career. The current generation now carries the successful racing history into the future. Most recently with the impressive class victory of a prototype based on the new MINI John Cooper Works at the legendary 24-hour race at the Nürburgring. Regardless of the model, all high-performance vehicles in the new MINI John Cooper Works family exude one decisive characteristic: the enthusiasm for top performance.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact: Corporate Communications\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI John Cooper Works (fuel consumption combined: 6.8 – 6.5 l/100km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 154 – 147 g/km; CO2-class: E).

We continue to steer our strategic course into the future, while avoiding short-term adjustments that could jeopardise our long-term success.\n\nOur commitment to technology openness has proven its value – and is paying off today more than ever.\n\nOur global positioning across sales, production and our supplier network secures us access to markets worldwide.\n\nBMW is a global company with a strong presence in all relevant economic regions. I regularly take the time to see this for myself. This doesn't work at a distance, but is best done when you are on the ground.\n\nSo, over the past three months, I have visited markets in all of our four sales regions – in Europe, the Americas, China and our emerging “Fourth Pillar Region”, which includes Southeast Asia and the Middle East, among others.\n\nOur global approach has often allowed us to compensate for fluctuating demand in individual markets. Of course, we are monitoring current developments in China very closely. The economic conditions there are challenging – and that applies to all market participants.\n\nHowever, it’s our ambition to perform better than our competitors, even in a challenging environment.\n\nThe key to this lies in our highly attractive product line-up. This enabled the BMW brand to deliver solid sales growth in Europe in the first nine months of the year.\n\nWith sales up by over 7 percent, we are significantly outperforming the total European market and expanding our market share.\n\nThere was particularly high demand\n\nand in France, with a gain of 14 percent.\n\nAnd the BMW brand is also growing in markets such as South Korea, Australia and India.\n\nGlobal demand for our high-margin models in the upper vehicle segments remains stable. The high-performance cars of BMW M reported sales growth of two percent in the year to the end of September. This month also sees the market launch of the latest M model many fans have been waiting for: the BMW M5 Touring*.\n\nWe are constantly expanding our product range across all drive variants in line with customer demand. Our highly flexible production network allows us to tap market potential.\n\nThis applies in particular to our all-electric models. In virtually every relevant segment, the BMW Group has at least one pure electric vehicle.\n\nAcross BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, customers have a choice of more than 15 different models. This means that the BMW Group has one of the broadest ranges of fully-electric vehicles among its competitors.\n\nSales in the first nine months of the year underscore the success of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy.\n\nWhile other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – are seeing a significant decrease in sales, battery-electric vehicles remain a growth driver for us in 2024.\n\nBy the end of September, we had sold almost 300,000 BEVs – an increase of more than 19 percent compared to the same period of last year. In the third quarter, battery-electric vehicles already accounted for 19 percent of the BMW Group’s total sales.\n\nThe BMW brand's fully-electric models performed particularly well in Europe – with sales climbing 36 percent in the first nine months.\n\nGlobally, BMW’s strong BEV portfolio fed growth in deliveries of more than 22 percent. The BMW i4* remains the brand's most popular electric vehicle.\n\nIt is closely followed by the BMW iX1*, which – like the BMW i7* – recorded double-digit growth. The first all-electric BMW iX2* is also on track for success following its market launch.\n\nThe new all-electric MINI models – led by the MINI Cooper SE* – are also being very well received. With a sales increase of 54 percent, MINI BEVs experienced highly dynamic growth in the third quarter. Starting this month, the all-electric MINI Aceman* will also be available in Europe.\n\nFor the first time, MINI is also electrifying its John Cooper Works variants. The MINI John Cooper Works Electric* and MINI John Cooper Works Aceman* celebrated their premiere at the Paris Motor Show.\n\nPerformance and driving dynamics are the clear focal point in both models. From January 2025 onwards, they will captivate even the most dedicated motorsport fans.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, we anticipate another significant increase in sales of fully and partially electrified vehicles. For that reason, we see no need to modify or delay the European Union's stricter CO2 fleet targets for 2025.\n\nWe have been working intensively to meet these new fleet targets for a very long time. We are therefore confident that we will also meet the stricter requirements for 2025, as we have consistently in the last years.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that a comprehensive and critical review of CO2 fleet legislation in the EU following 2025 is absolutely essential.\n\nWhat matters most is every tonne of CO2 we can save today – not sometime in the future. This is why the use of low-CO2 fuels, such as e-fuels, E25 or HVO100, should also be revisited. These fuels could immediately improve the carbon footprint of the more than 250 million vehicles already on roads in the EU.\n\nBy 2030, all-electric vehicles will account for more than 50 percent of our total sales. The rollout of our fully-electric NEUE KLASSE will play an important part in this.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is now entering the final straight – and we are keeping this forward-looking project on track. With a new design, the next generation of electric drives and a comprehensive digital experience, the NEUE KLASSE will set completely new standards.\n\nIn just under a year, the first series-production SAV model of the NEUE KLASSE will roll off the line at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary. This will soon be followed by a sporty sedan from our main plant in Munich.\n\nPreparations for the launch are progressing well:\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we will elevate our entire vehicle portfolio to a whole new level of innovation. This will be possible thanks to our use of technology clusters, which can be integrated into all future vehicles.\n\nIn this way, all our products will benefit from the technological leaps we will achieve with the NEUE KLASSE. This applies not only to our all-electric vehicles, but across all drive technologies.\n\nOur continued, systematic implementation of technology openness also ensures that we will continue to offer the latest ICE models in the coming years.\n\nIn 2028, we will introduce another element to our drive train portfolio: the BMW Group’s first series-produced fuel cell vehicle.\n\nHydrogen will play an increasingly important role in decarbonisation. This makes vehicles with a fuel cell drive train a logical complement to established drive technologies.\n\nTo develop the new generation of fuel cell drive trains, we are deepening our long-standing cooperation with Toyota. We announced this in September together with Toyota CEO Koji Sato.\n\nThis collaboration also shares the goal of expanding infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling and electric vehicle charging.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe European automotive industry currently faces fundamentally different challenges from those we have faced in the past.\n\nWe are not dealing with a singular, overarching occurrence.\n\nInstead, we are facing a tangle of critical influencing factors that keep growing in number.\n\nIn such a phase, we do not need short-term incentives that only create a fleeting impact. What global companies truly need is a reliable and binding framework for progress and prosperity.\n\nThe introduction of tariffs on electric vehicles imported into the EU from China is just one example. Import duties do NOT make European manufacturers any more competitive.\n\nOn the contrary: They undermine the business models of companies that operate globally.\n\nAnd, since these tariffs mainly affect small electric cars built by European manufacturers, they could even impede the growth of e-mobility.\n\nMeasures like these are also inconsistent with the EU value of free trade. Free movement of goods is a key success factor for economic growth – not just within the European Union, but globally.\n\nFree trade remains a guiding principle for the BMW Group – and we will continue to advocate for it. Because protectionism always carries the risk that measures will provoke countermeasures – ultimately hurting everyone involved, rather than benefitting any of them.\n\nWe operate as a global player, making it all the more important to maintain our strategy of balanced global positioning. This applies as much to our sales and production network as to our selection of suppliers.\n\nWe continue to systematically expand our “local for local” approach – making our supply chains more resilient and improving our access to different market regions.\n\nAnd while Germany’s future as an industrial location may be questioned by some, we are making investments here.\n\nIn Irlbach-Straßkirchen in Bavaria, we are building a new assembly plant for the latest generation of high-voltage batteries. They will be used for the first time in the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nA total of five new assembly plants are under construction near our production sites worldwide, across all three major sales regions – Europe, the Americas and China.\n\nIn this way, we are already laying the foundation today for successful growth in the future.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis past quarter, we faced a series of extraordinary challenges.\n\nOne of the BMW Group’s biggest strengths is our ability to consistently find the right solutions and implement the necessary steps swiftly and efficiently.\n\nOur company maintains a robust global presence. Our strategic direction for the future is solid. We are carefully adapting our approach to changing conditions and planning for a range of scenarios.\n\nWe continue to be guided by the developments we can realistically expect to see in different regions of the world.\n\nThe fourth quarter will demonstrate that our measures – despite all the ongoing challenges – yield positive results. We therefore approach the final quarter of the current financial year with a sense of confidence.\n\nWe are striking a balance between securing short-term earnings and long-term success: This year, we are investing more than ever in new products, technologies and our plants, so that we can continue the BMW success story with the NEUE KLASSE from next year onwards.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Touring: energy consumption weighted combined: 27,6 kWh/100 km and 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery: G; weighted combined: B; fuel consumption with unloaded battery: 10,9 l/100 km (WLTP) BMW i4 eDrive40 Gran Coupé: energy consumption weighted combined: 18,6 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A BMW iX1 eDrive20: energy consumption weighted combined: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 474 km (WLTP); performance: 150 kW (204 PS) BMW i7 eDrive50: energy consumption weighted combined: 19,2 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 610 km (WLTP); performance: 335 kW (455 PS) BMW iX2 eDrive20: energy consumption weighted combined: 15,3 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 478 km (WLTP); performance: 150 kW (204 PS) MINI Cooper SE: energy consumption (NEFZ) in kWh/100km: – ; energy consumption (WLTP) in kWh/100km: 14,8 – 14,1; electrical range (WLTP) in km: 385 – 402.

This was mainly due to two factors:\n\nIn the case of IBS, numerous markets have to replace the affected parts before cars can be delivered to customers.\n\nThis led to temporary delivery stops that impacted sales and revenues and drove up inventory levels.\n\nIn the third quarter, we fully recognised the necessary provisions for warranty obligations in the high three-digit million-euro range.\n\nLooking forward, we have already made good progress with the implementation of technical measures worldwide and expect to complete them for most cars held in stock by the end of this year.\n\nSo in Q4 we will see volumes well above Q3 and an improved product mix.\n\nSLIDE 3: BMW Group Performance per Q3 2024\n\nLet’s now take a look into the numbers for the third quarter.\n\nAt Group level, revenues were significantly lower than in the prior-year quarter, at 32.4 billion euros.\n\nGroup EBIT totalled 1.7 billion euros in the third quarter.\n\nThe Financial Result was considerably impacted by negative fair value measurement effects and, consequently, Group EBT amounted to 838 million euros between July and September.\n\nThe Group EBT margin for the third quarter came in at 2.6 percent.\n\nYear to date, Group EBT totalled almost 8.9 billion euros, resulting in an EBT margin of 8.4 percent.\n\nThe Automotive EBIT margin was 2.3 percent for the third quarter and 6.6 percent for the year to the end of September.\n\nExcluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 3.5 percent for the quarter and 7.7 percent for the first nine months.\n\nAfter nine months, the BMW Group’s global sales showed a slight year-on-year decrease of 4.5 percent.\n\nThe Balance Sheet of the BMW Group has increased by 11 billion euros since the beginning of the year.\n\nHalf of this increase is driven by the growth of our Financial Services portfolio and thus represents future profit potential.\n\nThe remaining increase is mainly related to temporary inventory build up.\n\nWhile the third quarter results were impacted by extraordinary factors, it is important to highlight the positive aspects of our operational performance:\n\nSLIDE 4: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nMoving to the Automotive Segment.\n\nIn the third quarter, the BMW Group delivered around 541,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a decrease of 13 percent compared to the same quarter of last year.\n\nHowever, our all-electric vehicles continued to perform well: Over 100,000 units were delivered to customers – 10.1 percent more than in the same quarter of last year.\n\nThe share of our all-electric vehicles was 19.1 percent of total sales.\n\nIn fact, more than a quarter of our total sales came from electrified vehicles – that is, BEVs, plus plug-in hybrids.\n\nSegment revenues amounted to around 28 billion euros – which was lower than in the same quarter of 2023.\n\nIn Q3 revenue per unit continues to be at last year’s level.\n\nEBIT for July to the end of September totalled 634 million euros.\n\nThe EBIT margin came in at 2.3 percent for the quarter and 6.6 percent for the year to the end of September.\n\nThat brings me to the next slide with the details of the changes in the operational result.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q3\n\nThe net balance of currency and raw material positions exceeded the previous year by 200 million euros.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the net balance of currency and raw material positions should provide a tailwind of close to one billion euros.\n\nWe expect this to nearly offset the headwinds from material costs.\n\nBut we are seeing additional requests for supply chain support.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model mix and pricing effects negatively impacted EBIT by 2.1 billion euros in the third quarter, compared to the previous year.\n\nAll three elements trended lower year-on-year.\n\nThe health of our dealers’ operations is strategically important to us. Therefore, in Q3, we have implemented measures jointly with our Chinese dealers to support both profitability and liquidity.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by about 100 million euros, compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development reached approximately 6.6 billion euros in the first nine months.\n\nThe R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was at 6.3 percent at the end of September. It is significantly higher than prior year due in part to higher expenditure, but also compounded by lower revenues.\n\nThe capitalisation ratio for development costs stood at 35.3 percent after nine months – evidence of our ongoing commitment to investing in innovation.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses for the third quarter were on par with the previous year, as planned.\n\nOther Cost Changes include the high three-digit million-euro warranty expenses related to IBS and some smaller compensating items.\n\nOverall, the negative net effect in this position amounts to 500 million euros, compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q3\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled negative 2.5 billion euros in the third quarter.\n\nEBT contributed around 400 million euros to Automotive Free cashflow.\n\nThe change in working capital of 1.9 billion euros reflects the increase in inventory levels.\n\nThe net effect of capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cashflow by 1.2 billion euros.\n\nCapital expenditure for July to September totalled 2.2 billion euros.\n\nThis represents a capex ratio of 6.7 percent for the third quarter and 5.3 percent for the nine-month period.\n\nA significant portion of our capital expenditure will accrue in the fourth quarter, as in previous years. As a result, we still expect the capex ratio for the full year to be over six percent.\n\nAt the end of the first nine months, free cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled negative 200 million euros.\n\nIn line with our guidance, we expect a free cashflow of over four billion euros for the full year, despite the planned peak investments in R&D and capex.\n\nOn the one hand, we anticipate a significant sequential increase in EBT in the final quarter of the year.\n\nOn the other hand, we also expect a strong positive contribution from the reduction in working capital.\n\nWe are making good progress in replacing the affected IBS components worldwide.\n\nIn addition, we have taken measures to adjust our production.\n\nGiven these measures and the projected sales volume increase in Q4, we expect inventory to be on previous year’s levels by the end of 2024.\n\nNet Financial Assets in the automotive business totalled close to 40 billion euros as of September.\n\nThe NFA position was impacted by the development of Free Cashflow in the third quarter. The strong Free Cashflow we are targeting in the fourth quarter will increase our NFA accordingly.\n\nGiven our strong balance sheet, the BMW Group remains committed to its shareholder return strategy, which includes both dividend payments and share buybacks.\n\nOn October 25th, we successfully completed tranche three of our ongoing share buyback program.\n\nWe will continue with this program following the completion of a separate buyback of common shares designated for our employee share program.\n\nWe anticipate that the current program of 2 billion euros will be finalized by April next year – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nAdditionally, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item at the upcoming AGM, seeking a new authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nSLIDE 7: Financial Services Segment YTD September\n\nLet’s move on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nThe positive trend in new business continued in the third quarter – for both new and used vehicles.\n\nIn the first nine months, more than 1.25 million new leasing and financing contracts were concluded. This represents a significant increase of 12.5 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe volume of new business, including all new financing and leasing contracts, also saw significant growth of 13.6 percent to 46.5 billion euros.\n\nThe total value of all contracts managed reached almost 144 billion euros at the end of September.\n\nSegment earnings for the first nine months were 12.4 percent lower year-on-year, at 2.15 billion euros.\n\nThis decrease resulted mainly from lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles as well as measurement effects related to the evaluation of interest rate derivatives.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the credit loss ratio stood at 0.26 percent across the entire credit portfolio.\n\nSLIDE 8: Motorcycles Segment in Q3\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, the ongoing competitive situation across core markets affected the volume development.\n\nDeliveries experienced a slight year-on-year decrease of 3.2 percent in the third quarter. Through September, they were on previous year’s level.\n\nThe segment's third-quarter EBIT totalled 27 million euros.\n\nThe EBIT margin came in at 3.8 percent for the third quarter and 9.5 percent for the nine-month period.\n\nSLIDE 9: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nin the fourth quarter, we expect the usual seasonality of fixed costs and ongoing muted demand in China.\n\nBut we will also see volumes well above Q3 and an improved product mix, as the completion of technical measures progresses.\n\nTherefore, we confirm the adjusted full-year guidance we communicated in September for the Group and for all segments.\n\nGroup earnings before tax will decrease significantly.\n\nIn the Automotive segment, we are planning for a slight decrease in deliveries compared to last year.\n\nThe share of all-electric vehicles will increase significantly.\n\nWe expect to see the EBIT margin in a corridor between 6 and 7 percent.\n\nThe Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) should come in between 11 and 13 percent.\n\nDeliveries in the Motorcycles Segment are projected to be on last year’s level.\n\nThe EBIT margin is forecast to be in a range between 6 and 7 percent, with a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 14 and 16 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, Return on Equity (RoE) should be between 15 and 18 percent for the full year.\n\nOur guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate significantly.\n\nSLIDE 10: Ambidextrous approach addresses the short and the long term\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nOur flexible approach allows us to calibrate to changing market dynamics and to constantly fine-tune our cost structures across the company.\n\nAt the same time, we remain committed to invest in strategic projects that will secure enduring future success.\n\nOur performance in the third quarter was impacted by one-time headwinds as well as ongoing challenges in the Chinese market.\n\nHowever, the sales development of our all-electric vehicles in the third quarter clearly demonstrates the continued success in implementing our electrification strategy.\n\nThis year, we are setting a decisive course for the future of our company. To that end both research and development spending and capital expenditure will peak in 2024, as planned. We expect our R&D ratio for the full year to exceed five percent, with a capex ratio of more than six percent.\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE we will take a significant step forward in design, battery technology, software and tech stack.\n\nThis ensures that we will capitalize on the full value generation potential as it rolls out across the whole product portfolio, starting at the end of next year.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE will shape the future of our company and deliver sustained success for the benefit of all stakeholders."}

The BMW Group expects sequentially increasing deliveries in the final quarter of 2024. This follows a third quarter in which technical actions linked to the Integrated Braking System (IBS) presented extraordinary challenges. As stated in the ad hoc announcement on September 10, the technical actions – together with weak demand in China – dampened the sales and revenue situation in the reporting period from July to September. Moreover, additional IBS-related provisions for warranty obligations in the high three-digit million-euro range impacted the third quarter. As a result, the BMW Group adjusted its 2024 financial guidance.\n\nNevertheless, the ramp-up in e-mobility remained strong and made a positive contribution in Q3. BMW Group BEV deliveries grew significantly by +10.1% compared to the previous year, and the share of sales of fully electric vehicles rose to 19.1% percent.\n\nThe BMW Group delivered a total of 1,754,157 automobiles in the nine-month period (2023:1,836,563 automobiles/ -4.5%). In the third quarter, the premium manufacturer delivered 540,881 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles (2023: 621,699 automobiles/ -13.0%).\n\nThe BMW Group benefits from its global presence and was able to balance out the different sales developments in the major world regions. The BMW brand grew by +4% outside China and gained +0.1% points in global market share while the premium brands MINI and Rolls-Royce were affected by model changes.\n\nIn Europe, the BMW brand experienced moderate growth of +7.6% over the nine-month period. Double digit growth in individual markets such as Spain, UK, France and Italy was a key driver. Despite a notable impact of the IBS issue in the Americas region and delivery stops in the US market, BMW sales reached the previous year's level and BMW maintained a stable market share.\n\nThe company has been working hard to replace the IBS components and is expediting the processing of vehicles in customer hands and those in stock. The majority of stock vehicles requiring action will be addressed and delivered before the end of the year.\n\n“After the extraordinary challenges in the third quarter, we are looking ahead: In the fourth quarter, we are back on track for stronger earnings in order to achieve our annual targets, despite planned high upfront expenditures,” said the Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Oliver Zipse, on Wednesday. “We are striking a balance between securing short-term earnings and long-term success: This year we are investing more than ever in new products, technologies and our plants, so that we can continue the BMW success story with the NEUE KLASSE from next year onwards.”\n\nIBS-related delivery stops and delays significantly impacted the BMW Group key financial figures in the reporting period: In Q3, the BMW Group posted revenues of €32,406 million (2023: €38,458 million/ -15.7%; adjusted for currency translation effects -15.3%; Sep YTD: €105,964 million; 2023: €112,530 million/ -5.8%; adjusted for currency translation effects -4.8%).\n\nR&D spending and capital expenditure to secure future competitiveness\n\nThe BMW Group has a solid and robust balance sheet which enables continued investments in the future. As previously announced, the company expects to post peak figures for both research & development and capital expenditure in 2024.At the core is the roll-out of NEUE KLASSE across the whole portfolio focused on electrification, decarbonisation and digitalisation of its product line-up and structures.\n\nGroup research and development expenditure for the first nine months totalled €6,642 million and was significantly higher than the previous year (2023: € 5,223 million/ +27.2%; in Q3: € 2,473 million/ +35.4%). The R&D ratio of 6.3% was also higher year-on-year due to declining revenues (2023: 4.6%/+1.7 percentage points; in Q3: 7.6%; +2.8 percentage points).\n\nImpact on Group and Automotive Segment financial figures\n\nGroup operating profit (EBIT) in the third quarter was €1,696 million (Q3 2023:\n\n€4,352 million/ -61.0%; Sep YTD: €9,627 million; 2023: €14,070 million/ -31.6%). Negative fair value measurement effects resulting from falling interest rates contributed significantly to the decline in the Group financial result of €-858 million (Q3/2023: €-289 million; Sep YTD: €-766 million; 2023: €-656 million). As a result, Group earnings before tax in the third quarter declined to €838 million (€4,063 million/ -79.4%; Sep YTD: €8,861 million; 2023: €13,414 million/ -33.9%). The Group EBT margin came in at 2.6% respectively at 8.4% after nine months (Q3/ 2023: 10.6%/ -8.0%-pts.; 2023: 11.9%/ -3.5%-pts.)\n\nThe Automotive Segment posted revenues of €27,854 million (2023: €32,096 million /-13.2%;adjusted for currency translation effects -12.8%) in the third quarter (Sep YTD: €90,863 million (2023: €94,994 million/-4.3%; adjusted for currency translation effects -3.1%). Vehicle sales declined and product mix was negatively impacted – mainly due to weaker demand in China and IBS-related delivery stops of higher-class vehicle models.\n\nEarnings before financial result (EBIT) in the same reporting period totalled € 634 million (Q3 2023: €3,135 million/ -79.8%; Sep YTD: €6,028 million (2023: €9,810 million/ -38.6%). The EBIT margin decreased to 2.3% respectively to 6.6% in Sep YTD (Q3 2023: 9.8%/ -7.5 %-pts.; 2023: 10.3%/ -3.7%-pts). Excluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 3.5% for the third quarter and 7.7% for September YTD.\n\nFree cash flow impacted by capital expenditure and inventory\n\nLower earnings and increased inventory – resulting from delivery stops and lower sales volumes – had a particular impact on Q3 auto free cash flow. Working capital changed by €-1.934 million over the period and high capital expenditure of €3,311 million weighed on free cash flow. In the third quarter, it posted €-2,480 million (2023: €2,618 million; Sep YTD: €-191 million/ 2023: €5,759 million). With the release of stock vehicles following IBS exchange, the company is aiming for inventory levels at the previous year's level in the fourth quarter. Lower inventory levels and a sequentially higher result will contribute to the forecast free cash flow of >€4 billion despite further high investments.\n\n“With stringent management, the BMW Group remains on track for the forecast auto free cash flow for the full year”, said BMW Group Chief Financial Officer Walter Mertl. “In the fourth quarter, sequentially higher deliveries and a stronger product mix will support our earnings. Despite the extraordinary pressures in Q3, we are adhering to our planned extensive investments. These are the basis for our future automotive portfolio, for our profit generation in the coming years. We are committed to our future and are shaping it today with focus”, said Mertl.\n\nCapex ratio in the third quarter was 6.7%; after nine months and stood at 5.3%. A capex ratio of > 6% is expected for the year as a whole — as in previous years, the fourth quarter will also show seasonally high capital expenditure.\n\nThe BMW Group has consistently continued its share buyback program: The third tranche of the current second share buyback programwas successfully completed on October 25, 2024.\n\nBased on the authorization of the Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2022, BMW AG acquired a total of 6.19% of the share capital as of September 30, 2024.\n\nFinancial Services Segment sees significant growth in new business\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the number of new financing and leasing contracts concluded in the first nine months of the year rose significantly to 1,252,251 (2023: 1,112,817 contracts/ +12.5%). The segment's volume of new business also grew significantly to €46,531 million (2023: €40,973 million/ +13.6%). The penetration rate increased to 42.3% (2023: 37.7%; +4.6 %-pts.).\n\nFor the year to the end of September, the segment reported an EBT of € 2,146 million (2023: €2,451 million/ -12.4%). Lower revenues from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, that resulted largely from the continuing normalisation of global used car markets, primarily weighed on the result. During the nine-month period, the credit loss ratio was 0.26% across the entire loan portfolio (2023: 0.15%).\n\nAdjusted guidance confirmed\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the BMW Group will continue to implement the measures outlined in the IBS technical campaigns with focus and urgency. Accordingly, it intends to hand over vehicles to customers that have been blocked to date. In many markets, the BMW Group is experiencing robust demand for its premium vehicles.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2024, the BMW Group is confirming its adjusted full-year guidance as of September 10: Group earnings before taxes will decrease significantly. Vehicle deliveries in the Automotive Segment will be slightly lower than the previous year. The EBIT margin for 2024 is forecast to be within the range of 6% to 7%. The return on capital employed (RoCE) is expected to be between 11% and 13%.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE) in the Financial Services Segment is projected to be between 15-18%, reflecting the current improvement in business development.\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, faced with a challenging market and competitive landscape, the BMW Group expects customer deliveries to be on a par with the previous year. The EBIT margin for 2024 will be in the range of 6% to 7%, with a return on capital employed (RoCE) of between 14% and 16%. These targets will be achieved with slightly higher employee numbers.\n\nThis guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate. Given the many uncertainties surrounding the existing risks and opportunities, the BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from current expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group continues to fully leverage its young and attractive product portfolio and its proven approach of technology openness. Thanks to its flexibility, the balance across key global regions and a strong balance sheet, it is able to adapt to dynamic market changes while consistently pursuing its long-term business success.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: YTD Q3 2024\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEmployees (as of 31 Dec. 2023)\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues.\n\n3 Common/preferred shares.

In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.\n\nProfit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\nProfit/loss as a percentage of revenues.\n\nPlug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.\n\nReturn on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Finance Communications\n\nEckhard Wannieck, head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nMedia website: \n\nIn 2023, the BMW Group sold over 2.55 million passenger vehicles and more than 209,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2023 was € 17.1 billion on revenues amounting to € 155.5 billion. As of 31 December 2023, the BMW Group had a workforce of 154,950 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action, from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products."}

For over 50 years now, the BMW Group has initiated and been engaged in hundreds of cultural cooperations worldwide, supporting hundreds of projects worldwide. In all the activities the company is involved in, the BMW Group guarantees absolute creative freedom. The BMW Group contributes to deepening the knowledge about the arts through long-term partnerships, such as the one concluded with Paris Photo two decades ago. The 2024 edition marks the return of Paris Photo to the historic Grand Palais following extensive renovations. For this occasion, artist Mustapha Azeroual and curator Marjolaine Lévy have created a new immersive scenography for‘The Green Ray’, enriched by new photographic works on large-scale panels and circular mobiles. BMW France supports the VIP programme by providing Paris Photo collectors, artists, curators and VIPs with an electric car service for more sustainable mobility in the capital during the fair.\n\nFor each edition of Paris Photo, BMW presents an artistic project led by the winning duo of the BMW ART MAKERS. This programme offers a grant of 10,000 euros to the artist and 8,000 euros to the curator, a research and production budget of 15,000 euros and solo exhibitions at emblematic events for culture and the visual arts in France, such as Paris Photo.\n\n‘The Green Ray’: an immersive and unique exhibition at Paris Photo Who has not dreamed of seeing what the eye cannot grasp? This is the ambition of ‘The Green Ray’, conceived by artist Mustapha Azeroual and curator Marjolaine Lévy.\n\nThe project is an extension of Mustapha Azeroual's photographic practice, the core of which is the production of abstract images that seek to give form to light and colour. The new panels and circular mobiles, on display at Paris Photo, reflect a protocol consisting first and foremost of recording the colour of the sky at sunrise and sunset on the high seas, in the Arctic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and in the Mediterranean Sea - territories that the artist has never explored before.\n\nMustapha Azeroual works in close collaboration with sailors, who are responsible for shooting sunrises and sunsets according to a procedure defined by him. He selects the most appropriate colours from these images to produce abstractions that are then set up as a lenticular panopticon – an installation of images with a pattern that changes according to the angle of view.\n\nThese abstract images, as rich and varied as they are, subtly denounce human overactivity since the colour of the sky, even in the ocean, is intrinsically linked to our presence on Earth. The poetics of blur and the visual vertigo of the infinite colour variations produced by the lenticular medium plunge the audience into celestial reveries that, behind their pure beauty, hide a very different reality.\n\n‘The Green Ray’ was exhibited for the first time at this year’s Rencontres d'Arles in the summer of 2024. The installation has now been redesigned for Paris Photo with a completely new scenography. The two monumental panopticons are presented in such a way as to create a sinuous path where the lenticular panels, now scattered throughout the space, create an even more destabilised perception for the public. The works on the wall interact with three lenticular mobiles floating in the space, like a nod to their celestial source, which is constantly changing under the effect of the air. The further you go, the more your eye is stimulated by the multiplication of effects produced by these extremely vibrant works.\n\nPractical informationParis Photo at the Grand Palais7 to 10 November 2024THE GREEN RAY exhibition Booth C01\n\nOn the occasion of Paris Photo, BMW France is launching its 4th call for entries for the BMW ART MAKERS programme.

On the occasion of BMW Motorrad factory rider Toprak Razgatlıoğlu winning the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad presents theBMW M RR WSBK CHAMPION EDITION 2024.\n\nSpecial edition of the BMW M 1000 RR M Competition comes with world champion honors.

With the near-production-ready BMW Concept F 450 GS, BMW Motorrad is offering a glimpse of a BMW GS for the A2 license class and what a whole new model series between the BMW G 310 and F 800/900 could look like.\n\n\"What was particularly important to us in the development of the newBMW Concept F 450 GS was to achieve the best handling for this segment and combine it with strong performance and optimal accessibility. The riding pleasure on-road and off-road is a top priority for this A2 BMW GS,\" says Sepp Mächler, Product Manager.\n\nUnmistakable BMW GS Design.\"The BMW Concept F 450 GS carries the characteristic DNA of the GS family,\" says Alexander Buckan, Head of BMW Motorrad Design. \"We have succeeded in designing the Concept with the sporty dynamic appeal of our large off-road icon in a particularly compact form.\"\n\nAs with the Trophy version of the BMW R 1300 GS, the colour scheme of blue, white and red with the base colour of Racing Blue metallic represents not only the highest performance and quality, but also the very dynamic and off-road-focused character.\n\nNewly Developed Twin-Cylinder Engine.The BMW Concept F 450 GS also delivers on the promise of premium quality in technical terms. The twin-cylinder inline engine has been developed from scratch and, thanks to a special, never-before-used ignition offset, is particularly characterful and eager to rev. Conforming to the A2 class, this engine delivers the full 48 hp and provides superior torque even at low revs.\n\nThe extremely compact dimensions of the engine, an excellent displacement-to-power ratio and the low weight are the result of innovative solutions and the use of lightweight materials, such as magnesium.\n\nPerformance: A Riding Machine for On- and Off-Road.On the chassis side too, the BMW Concept F 450 GS sets new standards in this segment with premium technology. \"We were able to start the development of this vehicle with a clean slate. The aim was to enable excellent off-road capability and, at the same time, a nimble and precise handling on the road. Accordingly, the BMW Concept F 450 GS is equipped with a fully adjustable upside-down fork and a shock absorber with load-dependent damping, drawing on technology from rally and enduro sport. Through the targeted use of lightweight construction and other state-of-the-art solutions, we can create a sensationally light vehicle close to the minimum weight requirement in the A2 class of 175 kg,\" says Marc Weber, lead engineer of the BMW Concept F 450 GS.\n\nDiverse Equipment for Safety and Comfort.Inspired by the larger sibling, the BMW R 1300 GS, the Concept F 450 GS also sets new standards in the areas of safety and functionality in its class. The relevant features range from BMW Motorrad ABS Pro (dependent on lean angle) to a performance brake, to freely configurable riding modes. With BMW Connectivity on board and the 6.5-inch TFT display, the networking of the motorcycle and smartphone as well as other accessories is enabled.\n\nA Glimpse into the Future.The question that arises when looking at the BMW Concept F 450 GS is: What could we expect in a production version? Johann Simon, vehicle project manager of the Concept F 450 GS, explains: \"No compromises for sure. Following the very sporty off-road focus of the Concept F 450 GS, we will implement the bike as close as possible to this concept. We will only adjust the seat height for better accessibility and easier handling. As an alternative to the cross-spoke wheels (19 inches front, 17 inches rear), lightweight but high-strength cast aluminium wheels in the same dimensions are also conceivable.\"\n\nBMW Motorrad plans to present the corresponding series vehicle in the style of the Concept F 450 GS in 2025."}

The Sunday following the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season finale at the Bahrain International Circuit was dedicated to the FIA WEC Rookie Test. BMW M Motorsport gave three of its BMW M works drivers from the GT3 programmes the opportunity to complete their first laps in the BMW M Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team WRT: Valentino Rossi (ITA), Dan Harper (GBR), and Max Hesse (GER).\n\nAll three had prepared for the Rookie Test in advance in the BMW M Motorsport simulator in Munich (GER). Hesse had already contributed to development work there during the season, and both he and Harper had previously taken part in an aerodynamic test in the cockpit of the BMW M Hybrid V8. For Rossi, it was his debut in the BMW M Motorsport Hypercar. In two sessions over a total duration of five hours, the trio had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the Hypercar on the racetrack. Rossi was driving the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, Harper and Hesse shared duties in the #15 car.\n\nNote to editors: At the following link, you will find images, footage, and video interviews from the 2024 FIA WEC season, including the Bahrain Rookie Test, available for editorial use: \n\nReactions after the Bahrain Rookie Test:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “After a long 2024 season in the FIA WEC, the Rookie Test here in Bahrain was a nice way to wrap things up. It’s always a great event that gives new but also young drivers the opportunity to drive these cars. And when you look at the timing monitor, our three ‘rookies’ did an outstanding job. This goes for our nine-time motorcycle world champion Valentino Rossi as well as for our former BMW Juniors Dan Harper and Max Hesse, who have gone through the BMW Junior Program and, after great development, have now arrived as full-fledged BMW M works drivers in the top class. All three got out of the car with big smiles on their faces after their first kilometres in the car. I believe this day will stay with them. We learned a lot, they learned a lot, and it was an all-around successful Rookie Test.”\n\nDan Harper (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 ): “It has been amazing. I really enjoyed it. It is definitely the most impressive race car I have ever driven, so that’s great. I think the biggest learning curve for me was getting used to the braking of the car. Of course the speed and acceleration is crazy and it’s really fun. But I think as a racing driver you just want more and more all the time, but to drive it’s very difficult. You need to be very precise, you don’t get away with as many little mistakes as in the GT3. Overall it was really fun and hopefully not the last time.”\n\nMax Hesse (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 ): “It was simply fantastic, I think the best day of my motorsport career so far. It was incredibly fun, and a big thank you to Andreas Roos, Vincent Vosse, BMW M Motorsport, and BMW M Team WRT. It was a cool day, and I learned a lot. The team chemistry between Dan, Vale, and me was also very good. The pace wasn’t bad either, which is always a positive. Of course, our approach today was to learn as much as possible, and we did that. But the ego in us also wants to be strong in terms of lap times, and that was the case for all three of us. It was exhausting and hot, but a great day.”\n\nValentino Rossi (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8): “Today was a fantastic day. I had the chance to drive the BMW M Hybrid V8 for the entire day, with the whole crew and René Rast who gave me advise. I enjoyed it a lot, the car is fantastic, very fast and very strong. It has a lot of power, the lap times have been 15 seconds faster than in the GT3, the tyres have great grip. It is a real race car. I was quite worried because I had never driven the Hypercar before, but I felt good from the first lap on because the car is stable and gave a good feedback. To go fast is very difficult but it’s a lot of fun. I have to say thank you for that great experience and I hope that I can have another chance to try the car.”"}

At the penultimate round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) in Japan’s Fuji, BMW M Team WRT celebrated the first podium finish for the BMW M Hybrid V8, and during the finale of its debut season in the FIA WEC, the hypercar once again proved its potential for top positions. In the 8 Hours of Bahrain (BRN), the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 dropped out of podium positions only in the eventful final stages, finishing the race in sixth place. Due to a penalty for a competitor, the car was subsequently promoted to fifth position. The #20 car, which also had a strong start to the race, was forced to retire due to a technical issue.\n\nBMW M Team WRT made a very good start in qualifying, securing a spot in the coveted Hyperpole with both BMW M Hybrid V8s, where the ten top cars battle for the front grid positions. In the early stages of the eight-hour race, the #20, driven by René Rast (GER), Robin Frijns (NED), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), moved from tenth to fifth position, fighting for the top spots. Unfortunately, after nearly four hours, the race ended prematurely for the #20 due to an engine issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Marco Wittmann (GER), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) gradually worked their way up from ninth on the grid. About two hours before the race’s end, Vanthoor took third place, putting the #15 trio in contention for another podium finish. However, in the turbulent final phase –marked by numerous Full Course Yellows, Virtual Safety Cars, Safety Car phases, and different pit stop strategies – the BMW M Hybrid V8 lost a bit of ground in the tightly packed field. After intense position battles, the #15 crossed the finish line in sixth place and was then later promoted to fifth position.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, Team WRT faced a tough final weekend. Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung finished the 8-hour race in 13th place in the #31 BMW M4 GT3. Their teammates Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) were 14th in the #46 BMW M4 GT3.\n\nNote to editors: At the following link, you will find images, footage, and video interviews from the 2024 FIA WEC season, including the finale in Bahrain, available for editorial use: \n\nReactions after the 8 Hours of Bahrain:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “A long season in the FIA WEC came to an end here in Bahrain. Of course, we had hoped for more, especially after both BMW M Hybrid V8s made it into the Hyperpole and performed very well in the race for a long time among the top cars. Unfortunately, the #20 car retired due to an engine issue, which we need to analyse further. With the #15, we positioned in the leading group until the end, but unfortunately, the Safety Car worked against our strategy. This result is not what we had hoped for, but overall, we can look back positively on the season, considering where we started in our first FIA WEC appearance in Qatar and where we are now in this fiercely contested world championship. A big thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport, BMW M Team WRT, all our drivers, and everyone involved in development. We’ll take this into the winter break and work hard to come back stronger next year. On the LMGT3 side, Bahrain was a disappointing race for us. We didn’t have the performance from the start to fight for a top result, and we need to analyse that carefully to be competitive next year.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “It was a tough race. We were in a position to fight for the podium again, which is good. Unfortunately, we were a bit unlucky with the last Full Course Yellow and were not able to hold our position until the end. But P6, later P5, is still a good result. On the LMGT3 side, we just didn’t have the pace all weekend to fight for the podium.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 5th place): “Today we could have finished better. But looking at the bigger picture, we have to see the positives. Now we are disappointed about crossing the line in P6, a position, that was far away at the beginning of the season. We improved a lot since Qatar and were able to fight for top positions regularly in the second half of the season. We have to take this and move on towards the next season.”\n\nRené Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “The retirement due to a technical issue with the powertrain is obviously disappointing, but until then, our race was going well. I had strong stints, and Robin was also doing great after me. Before our problems, we were fighting for positions three, four, and five. Later in the race, our sister car even had a shot at victory. So we can look positively at our performance – we can fight for top spots on our own merit. That’s great motivation for the 2025 season.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 13th place): “When you have no pace, it makes a race very difficult. We did your best, our crew did a perfect job. To still lose P3 in the championship, is sad. Looking back at the season, we can be very proud. It was the first time in this championship for many of us and we won a race and finished second in Le Mans.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 14th place): “It was the first FIA WEC season for me, BMW M Motorsport and the team in the LMGT3 category. And this championship is very unique. We had good races and very difficult races. But in the end we can be happy with two podium finishes, although we weren’t able to celebrate a win unfortunately.”"}

The main markets have been the UK, China and the US.\n\nSporty, elegant design\n\nThe new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé is captivating, with its expressive styling, completely new range of engines, extensively revised suspension technologies and an innovative system for partially automated driving and parking that comes as standard. It has also gained 25 millimetres in height and 20 millimetres in length.\n\nThe exterior design is defined by a low front section angled deep to the road, a dynamically elongated silhouette and a powerful-looking rear, lending the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé even more sporty elegance. The tailgate is assembled with the help of a completely new production machine that was installed at the Plant Leipzig bodyshop specially for the purpose and features laser-beam welding technology. Like the new BMW 1 Series, which has been rolling off the production line since July, the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé features the striking, broad BMW kidney grille with its innovative combination of vertical and diagonal bars. From March 2025 this will be available with an optional illuminated surround as well.\n\nNew engines and colours\n\nThe redesigned interior of the four-door BMW 2 Series Coupé is entirely leather-free and comes complete with Curved Display, just like all the other BMW models made in Leipzig. Reengineered seats offer enhanced comfort, especially on longer journeys.\n\nThe compact BMW 2 Series four-door is currently available in two unicolour, seven metallic and four BMW Individual finishes as well as a wide range of BMW Individual special paints. An optional contrast roof is also available, in high-gloss black.\n\nPlant extension and nightshifts support increased production volume\n\nWith the production launch of the second-generation BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé, the model family at BMW Group Plant Leipzig is now complete. “The new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé, BMW 1 Series, BMW Active Tourer, MINI Countryman and our first fully electric model, the MINI Countryman Electric, make for good capacity utilisation at Plant Leipzig. Our products are very popular with customers,” says Plant Director Petra Peterhansel.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig has been undergoing comprehensive extension since 2018 and can now manufacture up to 350,000 cars a year – 100,000 more than previously. Since November 2023 its production volumes have increased thanks to the MINI Countryman, making it the only BMW Group plant to manufacture cars by two brands on the same production line. Plant Leipzig can produce up to 500 MINI and approx. 800 BMW vehicles a day, with increased volumes helping to secure employment and generating as many as 900 new jobs in vehicle production alone\n\nin 2024. Since opening for business in 2005, Plant Leipzig introduced nightshifts in assembly for the first time in September of this year and now manufactures BMW and MINI vehicles round the clock in three shifts.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: CO2-Emissions & Consumption BMW M235 xDrive Gran Coupé: combined fuel consumption according to WLTP: 8.2 – 7.5 l/100 km (62 miles); combined CO2 emissions according to WLTP: 185 – 170 g/km; combined fuel consumption according to Pkw-EnVKV: 8.2 l/100 km (62 miles); combined CO2 emissions according to Pkw-EnVKV: 185 g/km; CO2 class according to Pkw-EnVKV: G.

The BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024 returned to its roots in Africa, with Namibia serving as the breathtaking backdrop for this ninth edition of the legendary event.\n\nOver the course of six days, 22 teams from around the world—comprising 16 men’s and 6 women’s teams—traversed an adventurous 1,350-kilometer route through some of Namibia's most challenging and diverse terrains.\n\nThis year's event was not merely a competition but a true test of skill, endurance, and camaraderie, reflecting the essence of the GS spirit.\n\nThe event kicked off with teams navigating vast dry savanna areas, towering canyons, rocky trails, and dry riverbeds. Each day presented unique challenges designed to push the limits of both the riders and their machines. Participants faced a series of special stages that tested their off-road riding capabilities, mechanical knowledge, navigation skills, intelligence, and teamwork, all while demonstrating the rugged versatility of the BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike.\n\nWith nearly 190 participants—including riders, marshals, mechanics, medical teams, and media representatives - from 34 nations, the GS Trophy 2024 was a global celebration of adventure motorcycling. It brought together 120 motorcycles and 32 support vehicles, creating a vivid tableau of international unity and shared passion for exploration.\n\nReturning to Africa, where the GS Trophy first began in 2008, this year’s edition paid homage to the spirit of adventure that has defined the event since its inception. After traveling through the challenging terrains of Tunisia, Southern Africa, Patagonia, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia, New Zealand, and Albania in previous editions, the GS Trophy came full circle, embracing Namibia's rugged beauty.\n\nTeam Germany Reclaims the Trophy.The final day of the BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024 was charged with excitement as Team Germany stood on the brink of an extraordinary achievement. With South Africa having claimed the last four editions—in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 - Germany was eager to carve their own place in the event’s storied history.\n\nHaving previously won the GS Trophy in 2012, Team Germany was no stranger to success. This year, they returned with renewed determination, ready to showcase their skill and teamwork on Namibia’s demanding and diverse terrain. From the challenging riverbed of the Khan River to the rugged ascents of Bosua Pass, the German team met every challenge with precision and resilience, distinguishing themselves through their consistent performance.\n\nReflecting on their victory, Christopher Michi (181) expressed the team’s disbelief and joy: “It’s an indescribable feeling. We came here to give our best, but actually to stand here as winners, it’s surreal.”\n\nThroughout the competition, their strategic approach and unwavering focus allowed them to steadily gain points, ultimately securing their lead. “We’ve trained for this moment for so long,” said Niko Wecker (182). “Every special stage, every obstacle, we faced it together as a team. South Africa has set the bar incredibly high for so many years, and to reach this milestone is just incredible.”\n\nWhen the final results were announced, the team’s excitement was undeniable. They had accomplished what they set out to do, reclaiming the GS Trophy title. “This victory is more than just a trophy,” Jan Stahl (183) reflected. “It’s the culmination of everything we’ve worked for. The feeling of standing here, knowing we’ve made it—it’s something we’ll never forget.”\n\nThe Rise of Team International: A New Milestone for the Female Riders.After six days of relentless competition through Namibia's challenging terrains, the Female International Team emerged victorious.\n\nFrom the outset, the team demonstrated a remarkable blend of skill, teamwork, and determination. Each special stage was met with enthusiasm and grit as they navigated through the dunes, rocky passes, and technical trails that defined this year's course. Their journey was not just about the competition; it was about the bond they shared and the passion they brought to every challenge.\n\n“I am beyond thrilled! This feels like a dream come true,” said Małgorzata Jakubiak (321), reflecting on their victory. “We knew the competition would be tough, but to stand here as winners is something I will cherish forever. We’ve pushed our limits and learned so much along the way.”\n\nThe team's strategy and cohesion were key to their success, allowing them to consistently perform at the highest level across the various special stages. Their victory was a testament to the strength of their preparation and the support they gave each other throughout the event. “I am over the moon!” said Anna Cárdova (322). “I never imagined we would come this far, and to be standing here as winners is just surreal. It’s an honor I never expected, and I’m so grateful to be a part of this incredible experience!”\n\nThis victory is not just a win for Team International; it is a celebration of the growing presence and impact of female riders in the world of adventure motorcycling.\n\nIn 2024, BMW Motorrad continues to champion female riders by maintaining dedicated competition categories for the women's teams, featuring six two-person teams tackling the same course and challenges as the men’s teams, competing for their own Trophy. And what an incredible display of skill and spirit it has been.\n\nFearless and remarkably prepared, these women have proven themselves in terms of both skills and endurance, and their mastery of the BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike has been impressive. These competitors stand at the forefront of a growing movement of women embracing adventure motorcycling, and their stories reflect the vibrant evolution of the female GS scene.\n\nThe Adventure Unfolded: Day-by-Day Triumphs and Trials.\n\nDay 1: Midgard to Ai Aiba – A Warm Welcome.At day 1 the GS Trophy 2024 kicked off with an exhilarating ride from Midgard to Ai Aiba, introducing participants to the Namibian landscape’s diverse and challenging terrain.\n\nThe riders faced three special challenges: the Namibia Welcome Trial, a technical section near an abandoned copper mine; the AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge, a thrilling test through a sandy riverbed; and the Photo Challenge, where riders had to capture the spirit of the day in a single image. Highlighted Challenge: AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge.Set in the sandy riverbed of Omaruru river, this challenge tested the riders' endurance and control as they navigated the soft sand and unpredictable terrain. It was a demanding start that quickly reminded everyone why they were there—to push their limits and embrace the adventure.\n\nDay 2: Ai Aiba to Spitzkoppe – Into the Heart of Namibia.Riders embarked on a scenic loop around Ai Aiba’s game reserve, encountering giraffes and zebras along the way before heading towards the iconic Spitzkoppe. They tackled the Flying Boxer Challenge, and the SENA Rock Challenge. Highlighted Challenge: Flying Boxer.Riders had to pull a suspended motorcycle across a canyon using ropes, a visually stunning challenge that required strength, coordination, and teamwork. It was a spectacular sight, showcasing both the riders' ingenuity and the breathtaking Namibian landscape.\n\nDay 3: Spitzkoppe Loop – Whispers of Stone and Sand.Day 3 saw riders navigating a loop around the Spitzkoppe, traversing the dry Omaruru Riverbed and its surrounding rocky terrain. They faced the Camel Thorn Tree Challenge, the Omaruru METZELER Challenge, and the Spitzkoppe INSTA360 Challenge and a continuation of the Photo Challenge. Highlighted Challenge: Camel Thorn Tree Challenge.Set in the sandy riverbed of the Omaruru River, this challenge required teams to plug a tire quickly and efficiently—a real-world scenario that tested their mechanical skills under pressure. It was a unique opportunity to showcase practical skills in the stunning yet harsh Namibian environment.\n\nDay 4: Spitzkoppe to Swakopmund – From the Desert to the Deep Blue.The riders journeyed westward from Spitzkoppe to the Atlantic coast, experiencing a dramatic change in scenery as they transitioned from desert dunes to the coastal town of Swakopmund. The day included the ADVANTEC Pull Challenge and the Rooi Tafel Trial. Highlighted Challenge: Rooi Tafel Trial.Riders navigated a technical trial course featuring tight turns, deep sand, and steep climbs in the rocky terrain near the Khan River Valley. The breathtaking landscape added to the difficulty and spectacle of this demanding challenge.\n\nDay 5: Swakopmund to Midgard – The Long Way Home.This was the longest and most varied day of the event, with riders covering over 400 km from the coast back to Midgard, traversing the Namib Desert and Bosua Pass. They faced the LEATT Push Challenge, MPS Questionaire and the Midgard Slow Trial. Highlighted Challenge: LEATT Push Challenge.Simulating a real-world scenario where a motorcycle needed to be jump-started, this challenge required teams to push the bike until it started, testing their coordination, strength, and ability to work under pressure. It was a unique and practical test of their skills.\n\nDay 6: Midgard Loop – The Final Kilometers.The final day featured a short but technical 50 km loop around the Midgard estate, with the last special challenge, the Final Course, taking place at the lodge. It was a true test of all the skills honed throughout the event. Highlighted Challenge: Final Course.Riders had to navigate a complex series of off-camber turns, tight corners, and a slalom section, with the entire course designed to push their technical abilities to the limit. It was a fitting conclusion to a week of intense competition and camaraderie.\n\nAfter six grueling days of adventure, the event concluded with an unforgettable celebration under the Namibian sky. The final night was filled with laughter, stories, and friendship as the riders and crew gathered for the closing ceremony. A local DJ and the band “Blikweg” provided the soundtrack for the evening, their energetic performances lifting the spirits of everyone present. The night reflected the GS Trophy spirit, with participants dancing, sharing their experiences, and celebrating their accomplishments. It was a fitting end to an epic journey, leaving everyone with cherished memories of both the competition and the friendships forged along the way.\n\nSafety at the Forefront: The GS Trophy Medical Team. David Rubel, the Lead Medical Coordinator, emphasized the GS Trophy's commitment to rider safety. \"Our main goal was to ensure the response time is on par with European or U.S. standards, aiming for a maximum of 15 to 16 minutes to reach an accident site,\" said Mr. Rubel. To achieve this, the team was well-equipped with “four medical cars, including two doctors, six paramedics, and a helicopter staffed with a doctor and a paramedic.”\n\nRegarding the challenges of the terrain, David Rubel noted, “The landscape here in Namibia is unforgiving. Whether it's dehydration due to the dry climate or potential injuries from falls, we have to be prepared for anything.”\n\nWith the support of the medical team and resources like satellite communication and a well-prepared rescue chain, the GS Trophy continues to prioritize the safety of its participants without compromising the spirit of adventure.\n\nThe BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike.The BMW R 1300 GS, the official bike for the competitors, was engineered specifically for the rigors of the GS Trophy. Its heart is the new 1,300cc air/liquid-cooled boxer engine, capable of producing 143 horsepower at 7,750 rpm and 145 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm, offering a robust yet smooth power delivery.

Its lightweight construction and advanced features made it the perfect tool for navigating Namibia’s challenging landscapes.\n\nThe BMW F 900 GS Trophy Marshal Bike.The marshals’ bike, the BMW F 900 GS, is a versatile mid-weight adventure bike designed for agility and control. It is powered by an 895cc parallel-twin engine, delivering 105 horsepower at 8,500 rpm and 92 Nm of torque at 6,750 rpm, offering a perfect balance of power and manageability.\n\nKey features tailored for the event included:\n\nThe BMW F 900 GS was equipped with a TFT display featuring integrated connectivity options, allowing marshals to stay in contact with the riders and support team. Its advanced technology and nimble performance made it an ideal companion for navigating unpredictable terrains and ensuring the smooth running of the event.\n\nBoth the BMW R 1300 GS and BMW F 900 GS demonstrated BMW Motorrad’s dedication to crafting motorcycles that excel in adventure riding, blending cutting-edge technology with the rugged capability needed for the world’s most challenging off-road event.\n\nNamibia. “The Land of Many Faces“.Namibia is a country of stunning diversity, both in its landscapes and its people. Situated in southwestern Africa, it is bordered by Angola and Zambia to the north, Botswana to the east, South Africa to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.\n\nThe country is known for its arid climate, being the driest in sub-Saharan Africa, and its vast, rugged terrains.\n\nGeography.Namibia spans an area of about 825,615 square kilometers, making it one of the largest countries in Africa. Its landscapes are dominated by deserts, including the ancient Namib Desert along the coast and the vast Kalahari Desert in the east. The central plateau, where the capital city Windhoek is located, rises to over 1,500 meters above sea level and is bordered by mountain ranges such as the Erongo Mountains. Namibia also has significant watercourses like the Okavango, Zambezi, and Kwando rivers, which carry water from high-rainfall areas in Angola across the Kalahari, supporting some of the most biodiverse areas in the country​.\n\nDemographics.Namibia is sparsely populated, with a population density of about 3.7 people per square kilometer. The population is approximately 2.8 million people as of 2023. It is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, with most people living in urban centers near major water sources. Windhoek, the capital, is the largest city, with a population of around 477,000​.\n\nHistory and Culture.Namibia has a rich cultural heritage influenced by various groups, including the Khoisan, Damara, and Nama people, as well as the Bantu-speaking Ovambo and Herero people who migrated into the area around the 14th century. The country was a German colony in the late 19th century and was later administered by South Africa until it gained independence in 1990. This colonial history has significantly impacted the country’s architecture, language, and cultural institutions.\n\nLandscape.The Namib Desert, which extends along the entire western coast of Namibia, is one of the oldest deserts in the world and features iconic landscapes such as the towering sand dunes of Sossusvlei. The Etosha Pan, a vast salt pan in the north, turns into a shallow lake during the rainy season and supports a diverse array of wildlife. In the south, the Fish River Canyon is one of the largest canyons in the world, showcasing spectacular geological formations​.\n\nNamibia’s unique blend of desert landscapes, towering mountains, and vibrant cultures make it a truly remarkable country, offering both the harsh beauty of its arid terrains and the resilience of its people.\n\nThe Spirit Behind the Ride: Heartwarming Tales from the GS Trophy.\n\nA Family Affair: Father and Son Make GS Trophy History.In a heartwarming display of the GS Spirit, Andrea Gioia (151) and his father, Massimo Gioia (152) of Team Italy, have become the first father and son duo to compete together in the GS Trophy. When asked about their feelings upon arrival, Massimo shared, “This is a very beautiful experience with my son, Andrea.” It's clear that this event is not just another competition for them; it's a shared adventure that has deepened their bond.\n\nFor Andrea, riding alongside his father is something special. “I always use a motorbike with my father, but I never did something like this with him before,” he said, emphasizing the uniqueness of participating in such a significant event together.\n\nTheir preparation for the GS Trophy was a true family affair. “We trained with the enduro motorbike and had some sessions with BMW Academy in Italy,” Massimo explained. Being just 40 kilometers apart back home allowed them to practice together often.\n\nRiding Through Pain: Anna’s Journey to the GS Trophy.Two months before the GS Trophy, Anna Cárdova (322) of the Female International Team was thrown off her horse, dislocating her shoulder in a painful accident that nearly derailed her dreams of competing.\n\n\"I had the joint out of the shoulder for almost two hours. It was really difficult to get it back, and it was really painful,\" she shared. Despite the pain, Anna’s resolve never wavered.\n\nFollowing the accident, she underwent five weeks of rehabilitation. “I found an amazing physiotherapist who gave me exercises to fix not just the joint but all the muscles and things around the shoulder.” Her dedication to recovery was unwavering, exercising four times a day. “It was necessary because I really wanted to be here,” she emphasized.\n\nWhen she finally saw her GS Trophy bike with her name on it, the struggle and pain seemed to fade. “The feeling is amazing. It’s something exceptional, the only one in the world, and it’s here at the GS Trophy,” she said, with a sense of accomplishment. Anna’s story is a powerful reminder that with resilience and determination, no challenge is insurmountable.\n\nAn Amputee’s Triumph: Conquering the GS Trophy Challenge. Mike Booth (160), MRP (Media Related Person) for Team UK, didn’t let his prosthetic leg hold him back from experiencing the thrill of the GS Trophy. “There’s two ways of looking at an injury,” he said. “You either use it as an excuse not to do things, or you use it as a reason to just try a bit harder.” With this mindset, he faced the same grueling routes as the competitors, covering the sandy tracks, rocky canyons, and long, demanding days.\n\nDespite losing his right leg in a severe crash at the Isle of Man TT two years ago, Mike chose to push his limits rather than be defined by them. “Some days were really hard. The sandy tracks were so churned up, I thought if this gets any harder, I might have to throw in the towel,” he shared, reflecting on the physical and mental challenge of keeping up with the intense pace.\n\nEven in those tough moments, Mike’s determination never wavered. “I’m never going to be as good as I was before because my leg isn’t going to grow back,” he said, “but if you keep trying to get better, stay healthy, and try to be as strong as you possibly can, then the only limiting factor is your mindset.”\n\nFor Mike, the GS Trophy was more than just a test of endurance; it was a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to overcome adversity. His journey serves as a powerful reminder to all: “Just get out there and do it if you can.”\n\nA New Generation Rises: A Young Competitor's Story.At just 21 years old, Sardar Shahan Khan (203) of Team India is the youngest participant in this year’s GS Trophy, embodying both youth and determination. “I’ve been off-roading for half of my life,” Shahan proudly shared. “I have three GSs at home, and half of their mileage is off-road.”\n\nThis was not his first attempt to qualify. Back in 2020, he competed in the qualifier of his home country, India, for the GS Trophy but couldn’t proceed due to not having a driver’s license. “I was 17 back then. I got the best time but couldn’t compete because I didn’t have my driver’s license yet,” he recalled. As soon as he turned 18, Shahan applied for his license the very next day and continued to train rigorously. Despite narrowly missing out on a spot in the 2022 Trophy, he remained undeterred, training alongside his friends and mentors, Dev Venkatesh (202) and Anand Dharesan (201). His persistence paid off as he finally made it to the GS Trophy 2024, not just as a participant but as a member of Team India.\n\nFor Shahan, the GS Trophy is just the beginning. He plans to take on an instructor course and explore rallying professionally. “Maybe I’ll be the youngest marshal someday,” he said with a smile. It’s clear that for Shahan, this adventure is only the start of a long and promising journey.\n\nBehind the Scenes: The Making of the GS Trophy. Stefanie Grund, Senior Project Manager for the International GS Trophy 2024, shared insights into the complexity of organizing such a large-scale event. “You can prepare everything perfectly but have to be ready for any change,” she stated, reflecting on the unpredictable nature of the event planning.\n\nEach GS Trophy comes with unique challenges. “There’s always one topic which is especially difficult for the organization,” she mentioned, highlighting the helicopter logistics in Namibia as a major issue this year.\n\nStefanie also explained the extensive permitting process in Namibia: “We had to get a lot of permits like drone permits, track permits, and work visas for everyone involved.” Support from a local film production agency was crucial in navigating these challenges.\n\nBMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024, Namibia.
