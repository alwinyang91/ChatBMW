Built on four continents, the BMW 3 Series has been one of the most important products in the BMW Group’s international production network for 50 years. Since manufacturing began in 1975, the BMW 3 Series has rolled off the assembly line more than 18 million times at 18 plants across 13 countries. Core themes of the BMW iFACTORY – such as efficiency, flexibility, digitalisation and resource-efficient production – thread consistently throughout the production history of the BMW 3 Series.\n\nBMW Group Plant Munich: Origins and role as a technology pioneer\n\nThe main plant in Munich has been the centre of BMW 3 Series production since 1975. From an early stage, the BMW Group committed to flexible manufacturing at the site, enabled by modern technologies, such as overhead conveyor systems and freely programmable welding machines. A fully-automated body shop was introduced in Munich in 1982 for the second generation of the BMW 3 Series. Through the use of industrial robots, it was possible to achieve an automation rate of more than 90 percent for this technology. Supplemented by flexible shift systems and modified work-time models, capacity increased significantly. Continuous modernisation, from powder coating technologies to computer-controlled engine production, ensured that the facility always remained state-of-the-art. Today, the plant deploys numerous digitalisation applications and AI-supported quality systems. In this way, the BMW 3 Series has consistently been a major driving force for the technological development of BMW Group production.\n\nBMW 3 Series as a driver of growth and internationalisation\n\nVolume growth at the plants was also influenced by the BMW 3 Series. In 1980, 3 Series production expanded from the main plant in Munich to Plant Dingolfing, and later to Plant Regensburg in 1986. The BMW 3 Series also provided the momentum for the internationalisation of BMW production. In the 1980s, additional production lines were established at other sites, including Rosslyn, South Africa (from 1984) and Spartanburg in the United States (from 1994). These locations enabled local supply for their respective markets and laid the foundations for the company’s global distribution of value creation – today, a key feature of the BMW Group production network.\n\nThe BMW 3 Series – an enabler for new plants\n\nSince the opening of the Regensburg plant, the BMW 3 Series has served as the enabler for all new BMW plants – with the exception of the facility in Debrecen. The plants in Spartanburg, Leipzig and San Luis Potosí, as well as the BBA joint venture in China, all initially ramped up with the BMW 3 Series. Over the decades, various 3 Series derivatives – ranging from sedans and convertibles to Touring and M versions – have been produced at nearly all BMW Group plants with maximum flexibility. Multiple derivatives and different drive technologies – vehicles with internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids and fully-electric drive trains – all come off the same assembly line.\n\nToday, the seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series is produced in Munich, Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and at the company's own regional plants in Chennai (India), Rayong (Thailand) and Araquari (Brazil), as well as at partner plants in further countries.\n\nPreparations for the eighth generation of the successful model series are proceeding in parallel: A fully-electric version of the BMW 3 Series will ramp up at Plant Munich from the second half of 2026 as the next vehicle of the NEUE KLASSE, with subsequent production in China and Mexico.

The 35-year-old was thrilled and stated how comfortable he feels in Munich and at the BMW International Open: “I played in Munich in football for Real Madrid quite a few times, and had some very good results, so Munich has been a great place for me. Coming back to play in the BMW International Open in the last few years has been really fun, enjoyed the course, enjoyed the city. It is always nice to be back.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the passion-filled golfer swapped the asphalt for the greens once again. Just as in the past two years, Bale teed off at the Pro-Am tournament in Eichenried – and did so in excellent company. He played alongside European Ryder Cup Captain Luke Donald (ENG) and German NHL stars Moritz Seider and Tim Stützle.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M4 Competition Coupé: fuel consumption in l/100 km: 9,9; CO2 emissions, combined in g/km: 223; CO2 class: G"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Golf, BMW International Open"}]}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had a solid weekend with strong results for Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) during the fourth round of the FIM Superbike World Championship at Cremona (ITA). Razgatlioglu rode his BMW M 1000 RR to second place in both the Superpole Race and the two main races, collecting important points for both World Championship standings. Teammate van der Mark impressed in Lombardy with great battles and celebrated three top-ten placements. In the riders' standings, Razgatlioglu confidently defended his second overall position, keeping the gap to the leader Nicolò Bulega (ITA), who won all three races, within limits. The fifth event of the WorldSBK 2025 will be held in two weeks (May 16-18) at Most, Czech Republic.\n\nReactions after the Cremona round:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “We can be very proud of the team's performance over the past weeks. You can see how hard we are fighting to get back to the top. After Assen, we have made a significant step forward and are more consistent. Toprak is right behind Bulega - we have already left the rest of the field behind us, which is crucial for us. We have closed the gap and can continue to work in the same way. Positive signs are also visible with Mikey. On the short track, everything was incredibly tight, a tenth faster in qualifying and the whole weekend would have looked different. He continues to work on his riding style to be fast as well. Overall, we definitely had a positive weekend. We look forward with confidence and will continue to give everything so that we will soon be back at the top again.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: \"It was literally a hot race. Even though the results might not fully reflect it, Mickey's performance was very strong. In qualifying, he was less than a tenth away from fifth place, so a P5 pace was evident both in qualifying and in the races. However, the track is very peculiar and offers very few overtaking opportunities, which made it difficult for him to move forward. Generally, the pace was higher than the race result indicates. Consequently, the weekend was very satisfying. Toprak maximised the high track temperatures and proved with his three second-places that we continue to be competitive and that our package is podium-capable this year as well. To become victory-capable, we still need to find a bit more. We continue to work intensively on this. But Toprak is giving his all, the BMW is giving its all, the team has continued to work hard and made no mistakes. We have improved from session to session in lap times and performance, the gaps have been getting smaller. Overall, it was a very successful race weekend.\"\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This weekend was a hard weekend, we’ve tried to improve the bike, from session to session, especially because I couldn’t race here last year. We did a very good job, because everbody was working so hard and every session we were able to improve the bike. Unfortunately not enough to win a race but P2 is better than nothing, especially after Assen. We also took very good points for the championship, so we are all in all happy. And we for sure will never give up. I like the race at Most and I’m usually very good there, so I will try to do my best again and will try to fight for the wins.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had a consistent weekend. We improved quite a lot but on this track it is so hard to overtake as everyone is doing the same pace. Our pace in every race has been good but track position is very important – and we were a bit unlucky in terms of position in every race actually. We scored some good points but for sure we want to fight for at least top-five. So we have to improve the package.

Razgatlioglu rode his BMW M 1000 RR to second place in both the Superpole Race and the two main races, collecting important points for both World Championship standings.Cremona. BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had a solid weekend with strong results for Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) during the fourth round of the FIM Superbike World Championship at Cremona (ITA). Razgatlioglu rode his BMW M 1000 RR to second place in both the Superpole Race and the two main races, collecting important points for both World Championship standings. Teammate van der Mark impressed in Lombardy with great battles and celebrated three top-ten placements. In the riders' standings, Razgatlioglu confidently defended his second overall position, keeping the gap to the leader Nicolò Bulega (ITA), who won all three races, within limits. The fifth event of the WorldSBK 2025 will be held in two weeks (May 16-18) at Most, Czech Republic.\n\nReactions after the Cremona round:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “We can be very proud of the team's performance over the past weeks. You can see how hard we are fighting to get back to the top. After Assen, we have made a significant step forward and are more consistent. Toprak is right behind Bulega - we have already left the rest of the field behind us, which is crucial for us. We have closed the gap and can continue to work in the same way. Positive signs are also visible with Mikey. On the short track, everything was incredibly tight, a tenth faster in qualifying and the whole weekend would have looked different. He continues to work on his riding style to be fast as well. Overall, we definitely had a positive weekend. We look forward with confidence and will continue to give everything so that we will soon be back at the top again.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: \"It was literally a hot race. Even though the results might not fully reflect it, Mickey's performance was very strong. In qualifying, he was less than a tenth away from fifth place, so a P5 pace was evident both in qualifying and in the races. However, the track is very peculiar and offers very few overtaking opportunities, which made it difficult for him to move forward. Generally, the pace was higher than the race result indicates. Consequently, the weekend was very satisfying. Toprak maximised the high track temperatures and proved with his three second-places that we continue to be competitive and that our package is podium-capable this year as well. To become victory-capable, we still need to find a bit more. We continue to work intensively on this. But Toprak is giving his all, the BMW is giving its all, the team has continued to work hard and made no mistakes. We have improved from session to session in lap times and performance, the gaps have been getting smaller. Overall, it was a very successful race weekend.\"\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This weekend was a hard weekend, we’ve tried to improve the bike, from session to session, especially because I couldn’t race here last year. We did a very good job, because everbody was working so hard and every session we were able to improve the bike. Unfortunately not enough to win a race but P2 is better than nothing, especially after Assen. We also took very good points for the championship, so we are all in all happy. And we for sure will never give up. I like the race at Most and I’m usually very good there, so I will try to do my best again and will try to fight for the wins.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had a consistent weekend. We improved quite a lot but on this track it is so hard to overtake as everyone is doing the same pace. Our pace in every race has been good but track position is very important – and we were a bit unlucky in terms of position in every race actually. We scored some good points but for sure we want to fight for at least top-five. So we have to improve the package.

BMW M Motorsport will compete with a star-studded line-up at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) on the last weekend of June. A total of eleven BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will be on the starting grid at the world's largest GT3 race. In addition to the two Pro Cup cars that compete throughout the entire Endurance Cup season of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, three more BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars with nine BMW M works drivers in the cockpits will compete in the highest category for BMW's 26th overall victory. A particularly notable trio will be in car #46: Valentino Rossi (ITA), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), and René Rast (GER).\n\nIn the Pro Cup at Spa-Francorchamps, a total of five BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will compete, with three fielded by Team WRT and two by the ROWE Racing Team. The Belgian WRT team will have its home race with the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, which is shared throughout the season of the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup by Ugo de Wilde, Charles Weerts (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). This trio won the season opener at Le Castellet (FRA). Additionally, the star-studded car #46 will see Magnussen compete in his first GT3 race for BMW M Motorsport, and car #31 will feature the three BMW M works drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER). All three drivers, like Magnussen, are part of BMW M Motorsport's LMDh programme.\n\nROWE Racing is expanding its line-up from one to two cars. In the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, GT World Challenge Europe regulars Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) will compete. Additionally, car #998 will include BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Dan Harper (GBR), and Max Hesse (GER). All three competed in the entire Endurance Cup season for ROWE Racing in 2024, but this season their main programmes are in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Eng, a three-time Spa winner (2016, 2018, 2023), is aiming for his fourth triumph in the Ardennes.\n\nBesides the five Pro Cup cars, six additional BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars compete in the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe and thus also at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Only once before has BMW M Motorsport been represented with so many cars since the beginning of the GT3 era, in 2015 with the BMW Z4 GT3. In the Gold Cup, AlManar Racing by Team WRT will field one car, and in the Silver Cup, Team WRT, Paradine Competition, and Century Motorsport will each enter one BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Additionally, one car each from Paradine Competition and BMW Italia Ceccato Racing will compete in the Bronze Cup.\n\nThe Prologue next week offers teams and drivers the opportunity to work on the set-up of the cars and to get accustomed to the challenging circuit.\n\nComments on the line-up:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are proud to be able to compete this year with such an impressive line-up at the world's largest GT3 race. Eleven BMW M4 GT3 EVOs, five of which are competing in the Pro Cup for the overall victory – that's simply fantastic! Never before have we had more GT3 cars at the 24h Spa-Francorchamps. Many thanks to everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport, the teams, and the drivers, without whom such a massive race effort would be unthinkable. The fact that we could get Valentino Rossi, Kevin Magnussen, and René Rast to share a car is a real highlight for the fans at the track and in front of the screens. From the perspective of BMW M Motorsport, I am looking forward to the performances of all BMW M4 GT3 EVO crews: the quintet in the Pro Cup competing for the overall victory, as well as the sextet fighting for wins in the other classes. Particularly, they are proof of how attractive our BMW M4 GT3 EVO is for customer teams. This trust in our product honours us.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “I am very happy to be back at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. It is a great race – very demanding and difficult – on a fantastic and challenging track. The level of competition between the best GT cars, teams and drivers in the world is extremely high. I can’t wait to race there together with my great teammates Kevin Magnussen and René Rast.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “I am really looking forward to competing with BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and getting to know the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. I have some GT experience from a joint start with my father at the Gulf 12 Hours a few years ago. René and Valentino will surely help me a lot in getting accustomed to the car quickly. It's exciting to share a car with both of them. Valentino is a legend, and René, whom I know well from the FIA WEC, is a true champion. It will be a pleasure to compete together at the 24h Spa-Francorchamps.”\n\nRené Rast (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “It is also a very special experience for me to compete at Spa-Francorchamps with two high-calibre drivers like Kevin and Valentino. I have won the 24-hour race twice – once with WRT – but I haven't been there for a few years. This time I'm back because I find the project very exciting and I'm sure I'll have a great time with Kevin and Valentino. Kevin obviously still lacks experience in the GT3 car, but I can certainly help him with that. He is a great racer and will quickly find his way.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “First of all, I am very happy to be back in the GT3 car. Due to my main programmes in the Hypercar, I have few opportunities to compete in GT3 races this season. The 24h Spa-Francorchamps is an absolute highlight for me. I have been on the podium there twice but have never won. I would like to achieve this milestone this time. I think with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and my two driver colleagues, we have all the possibilities to do so. I know Dries and Marco very well, which will surely help us quickly get up to speed. Our very good mutual understanding is an important factor for our line-up.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#998 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing): “I am very excited to compete once more at Spa-Francorchamps with ROWE Racing and hopefully achieve my fourth victory at the 24-hour race. For me, the Prologue will first be about getting used to the GT3 car again. But I don't expect any difficulties, as after so many years the feeling is ingrained. It's a great story that I'm sharing the car with Dan and Max. I've known them since hour zero, as I was one of the mentors of the BMW Junior Team back then.

It will be a pleasure to compete together at the 24h Spa-Francorchamps.”\n\nRené Rast (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “It is also a very special experience for me to compete at Spa-Francorchamps with two high-calibre drivers like Kevin and Valentino. I have won the 24-hour race twice – once with WRT – but I haven't been there for a few years. This time I'm back because I find the project very exciting and I'm sure I'll have a great time with Kevin and Valentino. Kevin obviously still lacks experience in the GT3 car, but I can certainly help him with that. He is a great racer and will quickly find his way.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “First of all, I am very happy to be back in the GT3 car. Due to my main programmes in the Hypercar, I have few opportunities to compete in GT3 races this season. The 24h Spa-Francorchamps is an absolute highlight for me. I have been on the podium there twice but have never won. I would like to achieve this milestone this time. I think with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and my two driver colleagues, we have all the possibilities to do so. I know Dries and Marco very well, which will surely help us quickly get up to speed. Our very good mutual understanding is an important factor for our line-up.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#998 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing): “I am very excited to compete once more at Spa-Francorchamps with ROWE Racing and hopefully achieve my fourth victory at the 24-hour race. For me, the Prologue will first be about getting used to the GT3 car again. But I don't expect any difficulties, as after so many years the feeling is ingrained. It's a great story that I'm sharing the car with Dan and Max. I've known them since hour zero, as I was one of the mentors of the BMW Junior Team back then. Seeing them now as established works drivers and witnessing how they deliver absolute top performances every race weekend is fantastic.”\n\nOverview of the driver line-ups in the Pro Cup:\n\n#31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nSheldon van der Linde (RSA)\n\n#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nKelvin van der Linde (RSA)\n\n#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nKevin Magnussen (DEN)\n\nValentino Rossi (ITA)\n\n#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing:\n\nRaffaele Marciello (SUI)\n\n#998 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport, GT Racing, 24h Races"}]}

BMW M Motorsport will compete with a star-studded line-up at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) on the last weekend of June. A total of eleven BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will be on the starting grid at the world's largest GT3 race. In addition to the two Pro Cup cars that compete throughout the entire Endurance Cup season of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, three more BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars with nine BMW M works drivers in the cockpits will compete in the highest category for BMW's 26th overall victory. A particularly notable trio will be in car #46: Valentino Rossi (ITA), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), and René Rast (GER).\n\nIn the Pro Cup at Spa-Francorchamps, a total of five BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will compete, with three fielded by Team WRT and two by the ROWE Racing Team. The Belgian WRT team will have its home race with the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, which is shared throughout the season of the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup by Ugo de Wilde, Charles Weerts (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). This trio won the season opener at Le Castellet (FRA). Additionally, the star-studded car #46 will see Magnussen compete in his first GT3 race for BMW M Motorsport, and car #31 will feature the three BMW M works drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER). All three drivers, like Magnussen, are part of BMW M Motorsport's LMDh programme.\n\nROWE Racing is expanding its line-up from one to two cars. In the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, GT World Challenge Europe regulars Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) will compete. Additionally, car #998 will include BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Dan Harper (GBR), and Max Hesse (GER). All three competed in the entire Endurance Cup season for ROWE Racing in 2024, but this season their main programmes are in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Eng, a three-time Spa winner (2016, 2018, 2023), is aiming for his fourth triumph in the Ardennes.\n\nBesides the five Pro Cup cars, six additional BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars compete in the Endurance Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe and thus also at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Only once before has BMW M Motorsport been represented with so many cars since the beginning of the GT3 era, in 2015 with the BMW Z4 GT3. In the Gold Cup, AlManar Racing by Team WRT will field one car, and in the Silver Cup, Team WRT, Paradine Competition, and Century Motorsport will each enter one BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Additionally, one car each from Paradine Competition and BMW Italia Ceccato Racing will compete in the Bronze Cup.\n\nThe Prologue next week offers teams and drivers the opportunity to work on the set-up of the cars and to get accustomed to the challenging circuit.\n\nComments on the line-up:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are proud to be able to compete this year with such an impressive line-up at the world's largest GT3 race. Eleven BMW M4 GT3 EVOs, five of which are competing in the Pro Cup for the overall victory – that's simply fantastic! Never before have we had more GT3 cars at the 24h Spa-Francorchamps. Many thanks to everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport, the teams, and the drivers, without whom such a massive race effort would be unthinkable. The fact that we could get Valentino Rossi, Kevin Magnussen, and René Rast to share a car is a real highlight for the fans at the track and in front of the screens. From the perspective of BMW M Motorsport, I am looking forward to the performances of all BMW M4 GT3 EVO crews: the quintet in the Pro Cup competing for the overall victory, as well as the sextet fighting for wins in the other classes. Particularly, they are proof of how attractive our BMW M4 GT3 EVO is for customer teams. This trust in our product honours us.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “I am very happy to be back at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. It is a great race – very demanding and difficult – on a fantastic and challenging track. The level of competition between the best GT cars, teams and drivers in the world is extremely high. I can’t wait to race there together with my great teammates Kevin Magnussen and René Rast.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): “I am really looking forward to competing with BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and getting to know the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing will compete on 21st/22nd June 2025 in the Green Hell to continue their joint success story at the 24 Hours of #Nürburgring (GER). After the team secured BMW's 20th and most recent overall victory in the Eifel region in 2020, the 21st triumph is now the major goal. The new #BMW M4 GT3 EVO and a strong quartet of BMW M works drivers are taking on this mission.\n\nROWE Racing has been competing in #BMW M Motorsport race cars at the 24h Nürburgring since 2016 and boasts an impressive record. Besides the overall victory in 2020, the team, led by Team Principal Hans-Peter Naundorf, has finished second on the podium three times (2017, 2021, 2023). Last year, the BMW M Team RMG BMW M4 GT3 finished in third place.\n\nThis year, ROWE Racing aims for its second victory and BMW's 21st win at the endurance classic. Taking the wheel of the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO will be Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). Farfus (2010) and van der Linde (2017 and 2022) are already on the winners' list of the 24h Nürburgring, while it would be a first for Krohn and Marciello. To prepare for the highlight, ROWE Racing will compete in the first two season races of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on 22nd March and 26th April.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 EVO will also make its debut on the Nordschleife in the hands of BMW M Motorsport customer teams during the 2025 season. The BMW M2 Racing, which BMW M Motorsport will offer as a new entry-level car starting in 2026, will undergo test runs at the Nürburgring, including the 24-hour race. Additionally, many privately entered BMW race cars of various generations will excite the fans.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are highly motivated to clinch the 21st overall victory for BMW at this year's 24-hour race. Last year, we were very close, and this time we are doing everything we can to stand at the top of the podium for the first time since 2020. With a top team like ROWE Racing and four high-class works drivers, we have created the best possible conditions. The fact that the three most important 24-hour races of the year take place on three consecutive weekends is a massive logistical challenge and anything but ideal. Nevertheless, our goal is to make the most of the situation and provide a great show for our many fans at the Nordschleife. The many private BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers will also contribute to this, giving the event its unique character.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am very much looking forward to seeing the EVO versions of our BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 in action for the first time at the world's toughest endurance race. The 24 Hours of Nürburgring is an absolute highlight for customer racing at BMW M Motorsport every year. The 20 overall and countless class victories over the past 55 years speak for themselves: BMW and the Nordschleife are inseparably linked. Seeing our BMW M2 Racing, which is still in development, in race action is another highlight of what will surely be another great weekend.”\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): “Fundamentally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, our experienced team, and our strong driver line-up, we have all the prerequisites to win at the Nürburgring for the first time since 2020.

ROWE Racing is competing for the 14th time, and our drivers, including former Nürburgring winners Augusto Farfus and Kelvin van der Linde, as well as Raffaele Marciello and Jesse Krohn, need not shy away from any other crew. At the same time, the race calendar gives us the unique opportunity to stand at the top of the podium at two 24-hour races within seven days. These are the positives, but it must also be said openly that the very unfortunate scheduling of the 24h Nürburgring presents us with unprecedented organisational challenges.

What a spectacular finale at the “6 Hours of Imola”, the second race of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season! Thanks to a tactical masterclass by BMW M Team WRT, the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), finished in second place. The crew of car #20 celebrated their first-ever podium in the FIA WEC – despite an early collision with another car and a repair in the pits. In the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, starting from pole position, battled for the win. After a penalty and a fantastic comeback at the end, drivers Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) celebrated a second-place finish on the podium .\n\nThe 6-hour Imola race was turbulent for all BMW M Motorsport crews. The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 started from 13th place but steadily moved up the order on the tight course. However, Rast collided with another car during an overtaking attempt, which was not his fault, severely damaging the rear wing. This required a complete rear section change during the subsequent pit stop, which the BMW M Team WRT crew accomplished in an extremely short time, thus limiting the time lost. Nevertheless, the journey from ninth place to the podium was long. To gain positions on the track, the team decided to shorten the penultimate refuelling stop, allowing them to take the lead. Van der Linde drove laps at qualifying pace to build enough time to overtake most competitors during their later final stops and cross the finish line in second place. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, with Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), started from third place and maintained that until the final hour of the race. However, the crew fell back due to performance issues and finished in sixth place.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO fought for the win right up to the finish line after an emotional rollercoaster. Al Harthy started from pole position and defended the lead during his double stint. Subsequent shifts in positions due to different strategies saw Rossi battling for first place with a Ferrari. During an overtaking attempt, he hit his opponent at the rear, for which the team received a stop-and-go penalty. That was followed by an impressive comeback by final driver van der Linde, who made up place after place and even closed the gap to the leading Porsche in the final laps. In a spectacular duel, he tried everything to snatch the victory but ultimately had to settle for second place. It was the second podium for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the second race of the season. The #31 crew with Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS), who had finished third in Qatar, experienced a troubled race this time and finished twelfth after several incidents and penalties.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to Team WRT, the drivers, and everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport on the double podium at Imola! The #20 crew did a fantastic job and, thanks to flawless performances by the drivers and perfect strategy, earned their deserved first podium in the FIA WEC. Car number 15 was performing very well for a long time after a strong qualifying, but unfortunately, it then lost performance. We need to investigate this. The podium for the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the LMGT3 class is also impressive. A podium finish in both classes and a generally strong performance of our cars – this gives us confidence for the upcoming races, where we will try to secure the first win of the year.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A great race weekend with a second place in both the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes! Additionally, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 finished sixth after encountering some issues towards the end of the race. We will investigate and find out exactly what happened. We also had various problems with car #31. It's unfortunate that it fell so far back because, by mid-race, the crew had moved up from twelfth at the start to second place. It's also frustrating for car #46, which led a large part of the race and had the speed to win – if it hadn't been for the penalty. Anyway, a double podium in the FIA WEC is always very satisfying. Next up is our home race at Spa-Francorchamps. Let's see what we can achieve there.”\n\nRené Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 2nd place): “A fantastic result – finally a podium! We didn't expect this after finishing 13th in qualifying, which didn't go as planned. But in the race, we showed how good our car and our team are. We made almost no mistakes, stayed calm, and executed well. In the end, a bit of luck was also involved, but we had so much bad luck in the last races that we now deserve to celebrate.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 6th place): “I'm happy for the #20 crew that they made it to the podium. They had a lot of bad luck last season. On our side of the garage, we can't be satisfied. Things were going well for a long time, but as the race progressed, we lost performance. Now we need to look at and understand how this happened. We all know how fast Dries is in the car. When I handed over to him, I thought it could be our day but then the problem occurred.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place LMGT3 class): “I have mixed feelings because a podium is a good result, but we could have won. It's very unfortunate because the team did a fantastic job, the car was very fast, and we managed the tyres well. Ahmad and especially Kelvin at the end drove brilliantly. Kelvin fought until the end and brought the podium home. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and hit the Ferrari in front of me during an overtaking attempt. The subsequent penalty cost us the win. I am sorry for that.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 12th place LMGT3 class): “There are races where everything just goes wrong. This was one of those races. We had a great car with great speed, but we just couldn't capitalise on it. That's hard to accept because it doesn't happen every time that you have such a strong package available. We made too many mistakes – and luck was also not on our side but the championship is still open. We now need to focus on the next race.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What a spectacular finale at the “6 Hours of Imola”, the second race of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season!

This concert returns to Melbourne’s Fed Square on Saturday, February 1, 2025, from 5pm to 7pm, promising a spectacular evening of world-class opera, free for everyone to enjoy.\n\nFor the first time, the event will introduce an exciting new edition – a 30-minute prelude performance by the Australian Girls Choir, highlighting BMW’s commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility by supporting arts and culture at a grassroots level. This performance will connect young, aspiring artists with award-winning operatic talent, embodying the spirit of creative collaboration.\n\nBMW Opera for All is a global initiative in collaboration with local opera organisations to provide world-class cultural experiences to the public for free.

Success is teamwork – this applies to the BMW Group in close collaboration with its external partners as much as it does to successful athletes. Continuous training, constant optimisation and the will to develop are essential in both worlds. With the Partner Academy, the BMW Group is focusing precisely on that. Qualifications and further education are the keys to achieving top performances together with its partners and suppliers, and to securing long-term success.\n\nSuperbike world champion and BMW Motorrad factory rider Toprak Razgatlioglu knows that continuous development and collaboration take quality to the next level. He has benefitted from targeted training and a strong team on his way to the top of his sport, while the BMW Group also relies on perfect collaboration with excellent partners.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu: The world title – a joint project\n\n”Everything is teamwork,” Razgatlioglu explained when asked about the secret of his success in the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship. “Working hard on the racetrack every day is not enough to win, but if your team is working hard every day, this is the perfect package. Only then can we make it to the top, as a unit.”\n\nThis principle also applies to the BMW Group and its global supplier network. With the Partner Academy, the company specifically promotes qualifications among its suppliers to jointly ensure high quality standards and drive innovation forward.\n\nPartner Academy: Top performances through qualificationsThe Partner Academy is the central qualifications platform for worldwide suppliers and partners of the BMW Group. It offers BMW-specific training to ensure the highest standards and meet the growing demands of a dynamic market.\n\nIlka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate, emphasised: “A common understanding is crucial for successful collaboration between us and our partners. Our Partner Academy is more than a platform – it provides our partners with the knowledge, skills and resources they need to shape the future of mobility together with us.”\n\nDr. Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Purchasing and Supplier Network, added: “Quality is an attitude that accompanies us every day. With the Neue Klasse, we are raising the bar – for ourselves and our supplier network. It is only through excellent collaboration and continuous training that we can ensure that our premium quality standards are maintained along the entire value chain.”\n\n“Better together” – for top performance on both sidesThe motto of the Partner Academy says it all: “Better together”. A team that continuously develops and acquires new knowledge works together more efficiently, raises quality levels and lays the foundation for success and growth.

This weekend, about 80,000 people from roughly 160 countries – from amateur runners to the very best in the world, and from handbikers to inline skaters – will be getting active on the streets of the German capital, as they make the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON one of the biggest marathon events in the world. It is a festival of running that stands for joy, openness, and friendly intercultural encounters – values that are deeply embedded in the BMW Group's identity. Furthermore, another absolute highlight awaits the roughly one million fans lining the street, as another endurance specialist will also line up at the start on Sunday. The new, all-electric BMW iX3 – the first model in the Neue Klasse – is this year’s lead vehicle.\n\n“It is only fitting that we’ve chosen the 2025 BMW BERLIN-MARATHON to this premiere. There could be no more suitable event for the first ‘race deployment’ of the new BMW iX3, where endurance is everything,” said Christian Ach, Head of BMW Deutschland. “The first model of the Neue Klasse was presented just a few weeks ago at IAA Mobility in Munich, and now it is on the streets of Berlin alongside world-class athletes – great company for an all-electric vehicle with a range of up to 805 kilometres, which can be charged with enough power for up to 372 kilometres of range in just ten minutes.”\n\nThe first model in the Neue Klasse is far more than a new BMW model.

Another factor behind these values is the new electronics and software architecture. Four ‘superbrain’ high-performance computers make the first Neue Klasse model more intelligent and more ready for the future than ever. The ‘Heart of Joy’ drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology enables unmatched handling dynamism and precision, while the latest systems for automated driving optimise symbiotic human-vehicle interaction.\n\nThe new BMW Panoramic iDrive takes operation and brand-typical driver focus to a new level.

Following its global debut in 2024, the BMW Group is proud to present the 20th BMW Art Car, designed by internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu, at this year’s edition of Art Basel Hong Kong. The showcase is part of the ongoing BMW Art Car World Tour, celebrating 50 years of the iconic “rolling sculptures” that unite art, design, and innovation. The 20th BMW Art Car will be on view at Art Basel Hong Kong alongside a display of miniature BMW Art Cars from across the past 50 years, with designs by artists including Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Jenny Holzer, and Jeff Koons, on the occasion of this milestone anniversary. As a global partner of Art Basel, BMW continues its longstanding support for the fair’s VIP car service.\n\nThe BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car, designed by Mehretu, has already captivated audiences worldwide with its bold and dynamic aesthetic. Deconstructing and reconstructing her large-scale painting “Everywhen” (2021–2023), the design incorporates digitally altered photographic layers, vibrant neon colours, and Mehretu’s signature black gestural marks. Using advanced 3D mapping technology, the car reflects a powerful fusion of art and high-performance engineering. Having competed at the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2024, the Art Car continues to make an impact both on the racetrack and in the art world.\n\nJulie Mehretu describes her vision: “Working on the BMW Art Car has allowed me to explore new dimensions of movement, space, and time. This car is not just an artwork; I call it a performative painting that reaches its full expression on the racetrack.”\n\n“The 20th BMW Art Car perfectly encapsulates the powerful symbiosis of art, technology, and design.

The result was a BMW 3.0 CSL, which competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975 and became a crowd favourite.\n\nThis was the birth of the BMW Art Car Collection. In the years that followed, renowned artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Ólafur Elíasson and Jeff Koons enriched the collection with further BMW Art Cars, each in their own individual style. Most recently, the Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei and American conceptual artist John Baldessari each presented a BMW Art Car based on the BMW M6 GT3 and GTLM respectively in 2016 and 2017.

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.\n\nThe credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.\n\nReturn on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.\n\nThe BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS. However, this does not mean that topics which are assessed as “not-material” are necessarily less important.\n\nWe view sustainability holistically and as a competitive advantage. That is why we disclose our sustainability performance to our investors and customers.\n\nYou will note that the implementation of ESRS requirements have contributed over 100 additional pages to our Report. Due to the company-specific materiality assessment, comparability between companies remains limited – even within the same industry.\n\nIndeed, it can be questioned how much value the additional scope and limited comparability offer to stakeholders. Accordingly, we welcome the proposed regulatory changes in the draft of the so-called Omnibus package and look forward to the draft updates and reduced scope of the ESRS.\n\nUltimately, we want added value for our stakeholders – meaning relevant and concise information. It’s not just about reporting and compliance.\n\nSLIDE: Proposed Dividend and Payout Ratio\n\nOne important element of our stakeholder orientation is our shareholder return strategy, which the BMW Group remains committed to.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 4.30 euros per share of common stock and 4.32 euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This results in a total dividend payout of 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe proposed dividend for 2024 represents a payout ratio of 36.7%. This is within our long-term strategic target range of 30-40% and notably higher than the payout ratio in 2023.\n\nOn January 2nd, we began the final tranche of our ongoing second share buyback program, which should be completed by latest April 30th. This will conclude the second program – with 2 billion euros – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nBy this point in time, we will have reduced a total of 47 million shares in circulation since the start of the share buyback authorization in 2022. This corresponds to over 7% reduction in share capital.\n\nAt the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nYou will have noted that we have made a step change in our approach since 2021. Starting in 2022, we added share buybacks as an additional instrument alongside dividend payments. We have also increasingly used the range of dividend payout corridor. And we increased the share of Automotive free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous years’ levels to almost 100% this year.\n\nSo, let’s move to the Outlook for 2025.\n\nLooking to the market development:\n\nDue to stabilizing inflation and declining interest rates in many countries, we expect to see a rise in demand.\n\nHow will the BMW Group’s sales performance develop this year?\n\nGiven the robust economic situation, we anticipate a solid market development in the US. In Europe, we do expect growth driven by electrified vehicles. The market dynamics in China, however, will remain challenging.\n\nFor the full year, revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment are expected to be in the same range as 2024.\n\nOur guidance reflects the current status of our planning, including all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th, 2025.\n\nWhat do we expect for our key performance indicators in 2025?\n\nLet me focus on selected guidance parameters.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce vehicles.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the total impact of the tariff increases in place as of March 12th amounts to approximately 1 percentage point on the Auto EBIT margin. As a result, the EBIT margin is now expected between 5 to 7%. Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.\n\nThe Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.\n\nStarting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nWe remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.\n\nTo that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.\n\nSo, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.\n\nWith the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Annual Conference 2025"}]}

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter.

A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year.

This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.\n\nThe credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.\n\nReturn on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.\n\nThe BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS. However, this does not mean that topics which are assessed as “not-material” are necessarily less important.\n\nWe view sustainability holistically and as a competitive advantage. That is why we disclose our sustainability performance to our investors and customers.\n\nYou will note that the implementation of ESRS requirements have contributed over 100 additional pages to our Report. Due to the company-specific materiality assessment, comparability between companies remains limited – even within the same industry.\n\nIndeed, it can be questioned how much value the additional scope and limited comparability offer to stakeholders. Accordingly, we welcome the proposed regulatory changes in the draft of the so-called Omnibus package and look forward to the draft updates and reduced scope of the ESRS.\n\nUltimately, we want added value for our stakeholders – meaning relevant and concise information. It’s not just about reporting and compliance.\n\nSLIDE: Proposed Dividend and Payout Ratio\n\nOne important element of our stakeholder orientation is our shareholder return strategy, which the BMW Group remains committed to.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 4.30 euros per share of common stock and 4.32 euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This results in a total dividend payout of 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe proposed dividend for 2024 represents a payout ratio of 36.7%. This is within our long-term strategic target range of 30-40% and notably higher than the payout ratio in 2023.\n\nOn January 2nd, we began the final tranche of our ongoing second share buyback program, which should be completed by latest April 30th. This will conclude the second program – with 2 billion euros – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nBy this point in time, we will have reduced a total of 47 million shares in circulation since the start of the share buyback authorization in 2022. This corresponds to over 7% reduction in share capital.\n\nAt the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nYou will have noted that we have made a step change in our approach since 2021. Starting in 2022, we added share buybacks as an additional instrument alongside dividend payments. We have also increasingly used the range of dividend payout corridor. And we increased the share of Automotive free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous years’ levels to almost 100% this year.\n\nSo, let’s move to the Outlook for 2025.\n\nLooking to the market development:\n\nDue to stabilizing inflation and declining interest rates in many countries, we expect to see a rise in demand.\n\nHow will the BMW Group’s sales performance develop this year?\n\nGiven the robust economic situation, we anticipate a solid market development in the US. In Europe, we do expect growth driven by electrified vehicles. The market dynamics in China, however, will remain challenging.\n\nFor the full year, revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment are expected to be in the same range as 2024.\n\nOur guidance reflects the current status of our planning, including all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th, 2025.\n\nWhat do we expect for our key performance indicators in 2025?\n\nLet me focus on selected guidance parameters.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce vehicles.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the total impact of the tariff increases in place as of March 12th amounts to approximately 1 percentage point on the Auto EBIT margin. As a result, the EBIT margin is now expected between 5 to 7%. Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.\n\nThe Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.\n\nStarting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nWe remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.\n\nTo that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.\n\nSo, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.\n\nWith the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finance, Facts, Figures, Corporate, Board Member Speeches, Corporate Events"}]}

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year.

Focused uncompromisingly on riding dynamics, it delivers a far sportier experience than its predecessor thanks to a completely redesigned engine and chassis, while still retaining core BMW values such as touring capability and comfort.\"Christof Lischka, Head of Development BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R: the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is noticeably sportier both technically and visually, featuring dynamic styling for an aggressive, athletic design. Four attractive model variants.\n\nThe goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 R was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the dynamic roadster with boxer engine. Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 R remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 1300 R is offered in Snapper Rocks metallic, with additional variants including the Exclusive variant in Racing blue metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium Option 719 Kilauea in Blackstorm metallic.\n\nSporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun and touring comfort.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 R significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new BMW R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. Optional Comfort handlebars are also available.\n\nA range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height, while a newly developed luggage system with electrified cases and a clever tank bag makes the bike ideal for comfortable touring and holiday trips.\n\nFor many years, BMW’s roadsters with boxer engine have enjoyed an excellent reputation among female customers and restarters in particular. This is thanks to their good accessibility and low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 R again placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of well below 790 mm. In addition to the standard seat, several others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor touring and holiday rides, the new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with a newly developed case system and case holders from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment ex works. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 R has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 R has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 R can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 R has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 R has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 R also features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels. The reduced rotational masses result in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimised handling qualities.\n\nNew electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA), with dynamic adjustment of the damping, spring rate and load compensation as optional equipment. The world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.\n\nWith its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear, the standard electronic Dynamic ESA itself offers a high level of riding safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. This makes the new BMW R 1300 R the first series production motorcycle with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring rest. With DSA, the rider benefits from even more refined handling and increased banking freedom.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 R comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nStandard full LED headlight in dynamic octagonal design and state-of-the-art LED lighting throughout. Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 R comes as standard with a newly designed LED headlight in a dynamic octagonal shape, featuring a distinctive light icon.\n\nWith the optional Adaptive Turning Light, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimised for cornering, depending on the banking position, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimising the light pattern, the dipped beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW) for safe and comfortable motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R can be equipped with the Riding Assistant for even safer and more comfortable motorcycling. This includes Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW).\n\nFor the first time, navigation preparation now features electric unlocking for maximum operating comfort as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThis item of ex works optional equipment allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a mount cradle. For the first time, this holder no longer requires a key – it unlocks electrically for maximum convenience.\n\nOptional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nAn extensive program of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW R 1300 R:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The BMW R 1300 R: The new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is significantly sportier, both technically and visually, delivering a more dynamic riding experience."}]}

Focused uncompromisingly on riding dynamics, it delivers a far sportier experience than its predecessor thanks to a completely redesigned engine and chassis, while still retaining core BMW values such as touring capability and comfort.\"Christof Lischka, Head of Development BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R: the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is noticeably sportier both technically and visually, featuring dynamic styling for an aggressive, athletic design. Four attractive model variants.\n\nThe goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 R was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the dynamic roadster with boxer engine. Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 R remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 1300 R is offered in Snapper Rocks metallic, with additional variants including the Exclusive variant in Racing blue metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium Option 719 Kilauea in Blackstorm metallic.\n\nSporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun and touring comfort.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 R significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new BMW R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. Optional Comfort handlebars are also available.\n\nA range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height, while a newly developed luggage system with electrified cases and a clever tank bag makes the bike ideal for comfortable touring and holiday trips.\n\nFor many years, BMW’s roadsters with boxer engine have enjoyed an excellent reputation among female customers and restarters in particular. This is thanks to their good accessibility and low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 R again placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of well below 790 mm. In addition to the standard seat, several others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor touring and holiday rides, the new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with a newly developed case system and case holders from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment ex works. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 R has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 R has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 R can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 R has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 R has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 R also features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels. The reduced rotational masses result in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimised handling qualities.\n\nNew electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA), with dynamic adjustment of the damping, spring rate and load compensation as optional equipment. The world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.\n\nWith its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear, the standard electronic Dynamic ESA itself offers a high level of riding safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. This makes the new BMW R 1300 R the first series production motorcycle with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring rest. With DSA, the rider benefits from even more refined handling and increased banking freedom.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 R comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nStandard full LED headlight in dynamic octagonal design and state-of-the-art LED lighting throughout. Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 R comes as standard with a newly designed LED headlight in a dynamic octagonal shape, featuring a distinctive light icon.\n\nWith the optional Adaptive Turning Light, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimised for cornering, depending on the banking position, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimising the light pattern, the dipped beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW) for safe and comfortable motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R can be equipped with the Riding Assistant for even safer and more comfortable motorcycling. This includes Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW).\n\nFor the first time, navigation preparation now features electric unlocking for maximum operating comfort as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThis item of ex works optional equipment allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a mount cradle. For the first time, this holder no longer requires a key – it unlocks electrically for maximum convenience.\n\nOptional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nAn extensive program of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW R 1300 R:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "R Series, R 1300 R"}]}

During the third Sprint weekend of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Valentino Rossi (ITA) celebrated another emotional home victory. At the wheel of the Team WRT #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, the local hero triumphed alongside Raffaele Marciello (SUI) in Saturday’s race in front of numerous euphoric fans in Emilia-Romagna. With this, Rossi secured his third consecutive win at the Misano World Circuit, following his victories in 2023 and 2024. Charles Weerts (BEL) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) completed a double podium for BMW M Motorsport by finishing third in Saturday’s one-hour sprint on the Adriatic coast.\n\nOn Sunday, the Belgian-South African duo in the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Team WRT staged a remarkable comeback, defending their lead in the Sprint Cup standings. In a race interrupted for more than two hours by a red flag, van der Linde and Weerts fought their way from 15th on the grid to fifth place, securing valuable points in the championship battle. One day after their victory, Rossi and Marciello were again in the fight for the win. Starting from second, Marciello repeatedly attacked for the lead. However, a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane dropped the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO far down the order.\n\nJens Klingmann (GER) and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) experienced a tough weekend. In the first qualifying session. Klingmann put the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from AlManar Racing by WRT on second place in the Gold category, but a start collision forced Klingmann to retire the car with damage—and also earned a 10-place grid penalty for the second race. Despite starting 35th on Sunday, Al Zubair and Klingmann fought their way into the top 20 and narrowly missed the Gold Cup podium by finishing fourth. Things went better for Gustav Bergström (SWE) and Gilles Stadsbader (BEL). After finishing fourth on Saturday, they manoeuvred the #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO to third in the Silver Cup, securing a class podium.\n\nIn the Bronze category, BMW M works driver Dan Harper and Darren Leung (both GBR) finished second in the Bronze Cup on Saturday. However, on Sunday, the British duo from Paradine Competition had no chance for a podium finish after receiving two penalties—one for the incident that caused the red flag, and one for an unsafe release. Their teammates Maxime Oosten and Mex Jansen (both NED) finished seventh and fifth in the Silver Cup races.\n\nPodium shower in the GT4 European Series\n\nIn the GT4 European Series, BMW M Motorsport teams had plenty of reason to celebrate. Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport claimed two podiums in the Silver class at Misano: on Saturday, the #12 BMW M4 GT4 EVO finished third, while on Sunday, the #11 car took second place. In the Am category, CHAZEL Technologie Course won both races with the #317 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. In the first race, Schubert Motorsport completed a BMW 1-2 finish in class with the #97, and the following day, their #98 BMW M4 GT4 EVO secured second place in the Pro-Am category. BMW brand colleagues from Team Continental Racing by Simpson Motorsport rounded off the strong weekend for BMW teams in GT4 with a third-place finish in class. On Saturday, W&D Racing Team also took third in Pro-Am.\n\nComments after the race.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to Team WRT, Valentino Rossi, and Raffaele Marciello for the win at Misano! That’s the third year in a row Valentino has triumphed at his home race. He once again proves what a phenomenal racer he has become on four wheels. It’s unfortunate things didn’t go ideally for Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts, but thanks to strong races, they still secured valuable championship points with P3 and P5. The title fight is still wide open. Thanks to everyone involved - I’m already looking forward to the next rounds of the GT World Challenge Europe at Magny-Cours.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, WRT): “It was a positive weekend. Congrats to Valentino and Raffaele for Saturday’s win—another success for the team at Misano which further extends our track record here. The #32 completed the double podium, and with fifth place on Sunday, they remain well placed in the championship. The #777 had a tough time in the Gold Cup, unfortunately. But congratulations to the #30 crew for the Silver Cup podium! Overall, we usually take even more points from Misano than we did this time—but let’s see what we can do at Magny-Cours.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 1st and 21st): “It was a very good weekend. We won a race, and just having a win on the board changes the whole season. I really enjoyed it, because we were competitive from the beginning. I drove well and kept improving throughout the weekend. Racing with Raffaele is a pleasure - he did an amazing job. The car was also very strong. The penalty on Sunday was really unfortunate - just a small mistake, but after the drive-through, the whole race was gone. Another podium would have been great. Maybe we could even have fought for a second win of the weekend.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 1st and 21st): “Overall, it was a very good weekend. The win on Saturday - especially sharing it with Valentino in front of the amazing Italian fans - was fantastic. Unfortunately, I made a small mistake entering the pits on Sunday and we got a penalty. That was disappointing, because a second podium would’ve been a perfect way to finish the weekend.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd and 5th): “Mixed feelings after this weekend. We came to Misano with very high expectations, and we weren’t quite able to meet them. Still, third and fifth place are important points for the championship. We're still leading the Sprint Cup, which is a positive. We now head to some circuits that might be a bit tougher for us. Hopefully, we can find some more performance and come back stronger.”\n\nCharles Weerts (Team WRT, #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 3rd and 5th): “We definitely expected to be stronger. Third and fifth weren’t what we were hoping for, especially on a track that usually suits us well - and with the championship entering a crucial stage. Unfortunately, a few unexpected challenges affected our performance. There are areas we need to analyse more closely, but we’ll keep pushing.”\n\nJens Klingmann (AlManar Racing by WRT, #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF and 4th in Gold Cup): “It was a difficult weekend for us. What hurts most is that we actually had a very strong car, but couldn’t turn that into results. That makes the disappointment even bigger. On the positive side, we’re making progress as a team from race to race, which gives us hope for the rest of the season - even though we’ve fallen behind in the standings.”\n\nDan Harper (Paradine Competition, #991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd and 8th in Bronze Cup): “I really enjoyed being back with Darren and Paradine Competition. We always have fun and they give me a fast car. The podium on Saturday was great - and the champagne tasted good too! Unfortunately, the Ferrari ahead of us was too strong, and Darren couldn’t make up points in Bronze. On Sunday, Darren was involved in the big crash. The most important thing is that all drivers are okay. That shows how safe our GT3 cars are nowadays. In that sense, it was a very lucky day. From a sporting perspective, we had no chance after the penalties - but the car was fast, and I still got to put in some good laps.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Alongside Raffaele Marciello, Valentino Rossi wins his home race for the third year in a row after triumphs in 2023 and 2024 +++ Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts retain their lead in the Sprint Cup drivers’ standings +++ Podium finishes in the Silver and Bronze classes at the Misano World Circuit +++"}]}

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nSpa-Francorchamps. The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend. At the third round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the home round for BMW M Team WRT, the “6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps,” both BMW M Hybrid V8s once again demonstrated their potential following the podium finish in Imola (ITA). This time, however, it went unrewarded. The #20 Hypercar was in the fight for another podium finish until shortly before the end. A slow puncture set the car back before it had to retire for safety reasons due to a brake issue. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 also showed strong performance, but, after an eventful six hours, it was only enough for tenth place.\n\nWith perfect spring weather and an impressive crowd of nearly 100,000 spectators over the weekend, the stage was set for an exciting FIA WEC race. Each of the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars was driven by a duo instead of the usual trio. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) drove the #15, while René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) shared driving duties in the #20. Their teammates Dries Vanthoor (BEL) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) are competing this weekend with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nAt the start, Magnussen sprinted from 11th on the grid into the top five with the #15 before handing over to Marciello. In the eventful race that followed, with several safety car periods, the car, however, was set back by two drive-through penalties. Rast initially ran outside the top ten in the #20, but he and Frijns made steady progress thanks to a strong performance and good strategy. Frijns eventually pushed the BMW M Hybrid V8 into podium contention with bold moves. But half an hour before the end, he had to return to the pits due to brake problems, and the team decided not to send the car back out.\n\nEven though the race outcome did not meet expectations, BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team WRT gathered valuable data in preparation for the season highlight – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The endurance classic at the Sarthe will be held as the fourth round of the 2025 FIA WEC on 14th /15th June.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the crews of both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs had a difficult weekend. Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), who had narrowly missed out on victory in Imola with a second-place finish, came ninth in class with the Team WRT #46 car. The race ended early for the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO during the second hour. Following contact, damage occurred in the suspension area, and the trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS) had to retire.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “If you look at the race result alone, it’s obviously not what we had hoped for here at the home race for BMW M Team WRT. Also given the performance we showed with both BMW M Hybrid V8s, we had expected more in the end. It was frustrating that car number 15 received two penalties. That, unfortunately, set the car back, and it was difficult to fight for a top result after that. Car number 20 was very strong throughout the entire race. It was great to see that we were once again able to fight for top positions and were back on course for the podium. Unfortunately, we first had a slow puncture and then a brake issue that we still need to examine more closely. For safety reasons, we decided to retire the car. So, our conclusion is: the performance was there again, but, of course, we also want to achieve the corresponding results. In the LMGT3 class, the outcome was also not what we had hoped for after the strong race in Imola. Unfortunately, car number 31 retired early after contact. Car number 46 did a race without mistakes, but, unfortunately, the performance wasn’t enough today to fight for the front. We will continue working and are now looking forward to Le Mans.

Unfortunately, a drive-through penalty set us back, and we took a strategic gamble to try and move up the order, knowing we couldn’t gain much on outright pace.

The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend. At the third round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the home round for BMW M Team WRT, the “6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps,” both BMW M Hybrid V8s once again demonstrated their potential following the podium finish in Imola (ITA). This time, however, it went unrewarded. The #20 Hypercar was in the fight for another podium finish until shortly before the end. A slow puncture set the car back before it had to retire for safety reasons due to a brake issue. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 also showed strong performance, but, after an eventful six hours, it was only enough for tenth place.\n\nWith perfect spring weather and an impressive crowd of nearly 100,000 spectators over the weekend, the stage was set for an exciting FIA WEC race. Each of the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars was driven by a duo instead of the usual trio. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) drove the #15, while René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) shared driving duties in the #20. Their teammates Dries Vanthoor (BEL) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) are competing this weekend with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nAt the start, Magnussen sprinted from 11th on the grid into the top five with the #15 before handing over to Marciello. In the eventful race that followed, with several safety car periods, the car, however, was set back by two drive-through penalties. Rast initially ran outside the top ten in the #20, but he and Frijns made steady progress thanks to a strong performance and good strategy. Frijns eventually pushed the BMW M Hybrid V8 into podium contention with bold moves. But half an hour before the end, he had to return to the pits due to brake problems, and the team decided not to send the car back out.\n\nEven though the race outcome did not meet expectations, BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team WRT gathered valuable data in preparation for the season highlight – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The endurance classic at the Sarthe will be held as the fourth round of the 2025 FIA WEC on 14th /15th June.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the crews of both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs had a difficult weekend. Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), who had narrowly missed out on victory in Imola with a second-place finish, came ninth in class with the Team WRT #46 car. The race ended early for the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO during the second hour. Following contact, damage occurred in the suspension area, and the trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS) had to retire.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “If you look at the race result alone, it’s obviously not what we had hoped for here at the home race for BMW M Team WRT. Also given the performance we showed with both BMW M Hybrid V8s, we had expected more in the end. It was frustrating that car number 15 received two penalties. That, unfortunately, set the car back, and it was difficult to fight for a top result after that. Car number 20 was very strong throughout the entire race. It was great to see that we were once again able to fight for top positions and were back on course for the podium. Unfortunately, we first had a slow puncture and then a brake issue that we still need to examine more closely. For safety reasons, we decided to retire the car. So, our conclusion is: the performance was there again, but, of course, we also want to achieve the corresponding results. In the LMGT3 class, the outcome was also not what we had hoped for after the strong race in Imola. Unfortunately, car number 31 retired early after contact. Car number 46 did a race without mistakes, but, unfortunately, the performance wasn’t enough today to fight for the front. We will continue working and are now looking forward to Le Mans.

Over the years, I’ve seen how strong they are as competitors, and now I’m looking forward to driving the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time. I know that adapting to a new car is always a challenge, and I’ll need to get used to the car over the winter but I generally like this type of car, as I’ve spent much of my career in similar cars. I can’t wait to work with all the great drivers at BMW M Motorsport – including, of course, Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde. We’ve known each other since we were kids and are good friends.

The Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 will be awarded to Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. The prize honours one of the most influential contemporary artists, who will be represented in Germany for the first time with a solo exhibition. His works, which range from sculpture and installation to conceptual practice, are characterised by sharp humour, bitter seriousness, and a profound reflection on social structures. Since its launch in 2000, this prestigious award has recognised artistic positions that have had a decisive influence on contemporary art and presented them to a broad public in Berlin. BMW has been the exclusive partner of this unique initiative since 2006. The exhibition accompanying the Preis der Nationalgalerie will open at the Neue Nationalgalerie during Berlin Art Week in September 2026.\n\n“Back in 2016, Maurizio Cattelan gave a fully electric BMW i3 a spaghetti-themed wrap as part of our partnership with ‘Rencontres d’Arles’. Creative freedom has defined BMW’s cultural engagement for over 50 years, through hundreds of collaborations across the globe. And it is precisely this freedom that Cattelan continues to explore to its fullest – with wit, intelligence, and often a sharp critical edge. Whether art reflects our existence or opens up new perspectives has been discussed since the Romantic era. In Cattelan’s case, it is always both. Social relevance and creative excellence come together here, just as they do with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, which BMW has supported for two decades. We congratulate Maurizio Cattelan on being awarded the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie and on his upcoming solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate.\n\nBMW and Maurizio Cattelan collaborated at “Rencontres d’Arles” in 2016; together with photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, Cattelan created a special project based around the fully electric BMW i3. The so-called “Spaghetti Car” featured the vehicle completely covered in spaghetti-themed foil – a humorous and conceptual work that playfully addressed issues of art, consumption, and sustainability.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Maurizio Cattelan (born 1960 in Padua) has been one of the defining voices in international art. His iconic works – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin, where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.\n\nThe expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie were also eligible to submit nominations.\n\nEmma Lavigne, Sam Keller, Klaus Biesenbach say: „Nearly two decades ago, as co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.\n\nCattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion, death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.\n\nIn Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being re-examined – between the last generations with direct connections to the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives – Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures, oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and open new vantage points on contemporary social debates. In a time of increasing political polarisation, his art can encourage us to view remembrance not as compulsion or obligation, but as a vital and relevant engagement with the present and the future.\n\nCattelan’s ironic questioning of authority and “truth” carries particular urgency today. At a moment when institutions – museums, politics and the media – are re-evaluating their credibility and social roles, he scrutinizes structures of power both within and beyond the art world, always without a moralizing tone. His works provoke reflection on personal responsibility, historical representation and the limits of institutional critique and authority. In an atmosphere of political and social hardening, Cattelan’s subversive humour acts as a liberating force. He reminds us that provocation and wit are not expressions of cynicism but forms of resistance and constructive reflection. Particularly in the German context, where public discourse often carries a strong moral charge, his art opens up spaces for thought beyond outrage and polarization. Cattelan is not an artist of straightforwardness. His strength lies in embracing ambiguity, exposing contradictions and posing new questions. This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a precondition for critical awareness.\n\nThe Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the 20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”\n\nChristian Kohorst, Chairman of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie, says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of international significance to Berlin.”\n\nMaurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context. In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition. The change of location places contemporary art in dialogue with the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie and its history. The iconic hall of the Mies van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a concise, artistic setting. The exhibition is made possible by the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie.\n\nFurther information on the Preis der Nationalgalerie and its comprehensive history can be found at preis.freunde-der-nationalgalerie.de.\n\nMaurizio Cattelan, 2025:BEING AN ARTIST IS NOT A JOB, IT'S A MALFUNCTIONART IS A WAY TO SURVIVE, NOT A WAY TO LIVEIF I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED ALONGTIME AGOSOMETIMES THE BEST IDEA IS THE ONE YOU'RE TOOASHAMEDTO SAY OUT LOUDFAILURE IS MY FAVORITE COLORI DON'T MAKE ART TO COMMUNICATE, I MAKE IT TO ESCAPEIF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING SERIOUS, WEAR A CLOWN'SNOSEI DON'T BELIEVE IN INSPIRATION, I BELIEVE IN GOOD TIMING ANDBETTER EXCUSESYOU DON'T MAKE A MASTERPIECE, YOU SURVIVE ONEBEAUTY IS THE PERFECT ALIBIMY GOAL IS TO VANISH COMPLETELY, LEAVING BEHIND JUST AQUESTION MARKAS LONG AS YOU DON'T CHOOSE, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLEBEING ORIGINAL IS OVERRATED, BEING PRECISE IS TERRIFYINGGUILT IS ONE OF THE PUREST MATERIALS AN ARTIST CAN USESOMETIMES I WISH I COULD COPYRIGHT SILENCEIF I BELIEVED IN MESSAGES, I'D WORK IN ADVERTISINGI DON'T CREATE MEANING, I OFFER TRAPS FOR ITTRUTH IS NOT AN INGREDIENT, IT'S THE AFTERTASTEEVERY ARTWORK IS A LOOPHOLEYOU KNOW IT'S WORKING WHEN YOU START REGRETTING ITIF I WANTED COMFORT, I'D BUY FURNITURETHE BEST ARTWORKS ARE MISTAKES NO ONE DARED TO FIXA GOOD WORK DOESN'T ASK FOR ATTENTION, IT STEALS ITA BANANA ON A WALL IS STILL MORE HONEST THAN MOSTPEOPLE I'VE METTHE MORE YOU POLISH AN IDEA, THE LESS IT CUTSIF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, IT WASN'T ARTCONCEPTUAL ART?

Whether art reflects our existence or opens up new perspectives has been discussed since the Romantic era. In Cattelan’s case, it is always both. Social relevance and creative excellence come together here, just as they do with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, which BMW has supported for two decades. We congratulate Maurizio Cattelan on being awarded the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie and on his upcoming solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate.\n\nBMW and Maurizio Cattelan collaborated at “Rencontres d’Arles” in 2016; together with photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, Cattelan created a special project based around the fully electric BMW i3. The so-called “Spaghetti Car” featured the vehicle completely covered in spaghetti-themed foil – a humorous and conceptual work that playfully addressed issues of art, consumption, and sustainability.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Maurizio Cattelan (born 1960 in Padua) has been one of the defining voices in international art. His iconic works – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin, where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.\n\nThe expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie were also eligible to submit nominations.\n\nEmma Lavigne, Sam Keller, Klaus Biesenbach say: „Nearly two decades ago, as co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.\n\nCattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion, death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.\n\nIn Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being re-examined – between the last generations with direct connections to the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives – Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures, oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and open new vantage points on contemporary social debates. In a time of increasing political polarisation, his art can encourage us to view remembrance not as compulsion or obligation, but as a vital and relevant engagement with the present and the future.\n\nCattelan’s ironic questioning of authority and “truth” carries particular urgency today. At a moment when institutions – museums, politics and the media – are re-evaluating their credibility and social roles, he scrutinizes structures of power both within and beyond the art world, always without a moralizing tone. His works provoke reflection on personal responsibility, historical representation and the limits of institutional critique and authority. In an atmosphere of political and social hardening, Cattelan’s subversive humour acts as a liberating force. He reminds us that provocation and wit are not expressions of cynicism but forms of resistance and constructive reflection. Particularly in the German context, where public discourse often carries a strong moral charge, his art opens up spaces for thought beyond outrage and polarization. Cattelan is not an artist of straightforwardness. His strength lies in embracing ambiguity, exposing contradictions and posing new questions. This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a precondition for critical awareness.\n\nThe Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the 20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”\n\nChristian Kohorst, Chairman of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie, says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of international significance to Berlin.”\n\nMaurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context. In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition. The change of location places contemporary art in dialogue with the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie and its history. The iconic hall of the Mies van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a concise, artistic setting. The exhibition is made possible by the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie.\n\nFurther information on the Preis der Nationalgalerie and its comprehensive history can be found at preis.freunde-der-nationalgalerie.de.\n\nMaurizio Cattelan, 2025:BEING AN ARTIST IS NOT A JOB, IT'S A MALFUNCTIONART IS A WAY TO SURVIVE, NOT A WAY TO LIVEIF I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED ALONGTIME AGOSOMETIMES THE BEST IDEA IS THE ONE YOU'RE TOOASHAMEDTO SAY OUT LOUDFAILURE IS MY FAVORITE COLORI DON'T MAKE ART TO COMMUNICATE, I MAKE IT TO ESCAPEIF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING SERIOUS, WEAR A CLOWN'SNOSEI DON'T BELIEVE IN INSPIRATION, I BELIEVE IN GOOD TIMING ANDBETTER EXCUSESYOU DON'T MAKE A MASTERPIECE, YOU SURVIVE ONEBEAUTY IS THE PERFECT ALIBIMY GOAL IS TO VANISH COMPLETELY, LEAVING BEHIND JUST AQUESTION MARKAS LONG AS YOU DON'T CHOOSE, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLEBEING ORIGINAL IS OVERRATED, BEING PRECISE IS TERRIFYINGGUILT IS ONE OF THE PUREST MATERIALS AN ARTIST CAN USESOMETIMES I WISH I COULD COPYRIGHT SILENCEIF I BELIEVED IN MESSAGES, I'D WORK IN ADVERTISINGI DON'T CREATE MEANING, I OFFER TRAPS FOR ITTRUTH IS NOT AN INGREDIENT, IT'S THE AFTERTASTEEVERY ARTWORK IS A LOOPHOLEYOU KNOW IT'S WORKING WHEN YOU START REGRETTING ITIF I WANTED COMFORT, I'D BUY FURNITURETHE BEST ARTWORKS ARE MISTAKES NO ONE DARED TO FIXA GOOD WORK DOESN'T ASK FOR ATTENTION, IT STEALS ITA BANANA ON A WALL IS STILL MORE HONEST THAN MOSTPEOPLE I'VE METTHE MORE YOU POLISH AN IDEA, THE LESS IT CUTSIF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, IT WASN'T ARTCONCEPTUAL ART?

Sporting a special design and equipped with the characteristic Safety Car roof beam, the car will appear on track at many of the most popular Special Events.\n\nAs in real-world motor racing, a lead car will take the field around a formation lap at classic iRacing events such as the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring (GER), or the “Petit Le Mans” at Road Atlanta (USA), before the participants launch their hunt for points with a “flying start”. The BMW M2 CS Racing is the youngest member of the BMW M Motorsport fleet on iRacing, while the BMW M2 Racing successor model is ready and waiting to hit the real racetrack for the 2026 season.\n\n“This Safety Car partnership represents a new chapter in the success story shared by BMW M Motorsport and iRacing,” said Timo Brückner, Project Lead BMW M Automotive Gaming. “Each season, the Special Events attract record levels of participants and have become real community favourites. For example, nearly 20,000 drivers competed in the 24 Hours of Daytona last year. I am delighted that we will enjoy a prominent position next season at the head of the field, with the BMW M2 CS Racing at these highlight events. Just as in real life, this race car is also the perfect entry-level model on iRacing, allowing drivers to later gain experience with the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW M4 GT3, and even in the BMW M Hybrid V8.”\n\nTony Gardner, iRacing president, said: “We have a strong partnership with BMW M Motorsport dating back more than a decade, having brought seven BMW race cars to iRacing. The M2 CS is the latest BMW to join iRacing and has already proven to be incredibly popular with our nearly 300,000 members. BMW M Motorsport becoming the official safety car partner of iRacing special events further solidifies the partnership and enhances the racing experience for our members. It’s exciting to see how important sim racing is to BMW and its brand – we are looking forward to the iRacing Daytona 24 powered by VCO on 18th January.”\n\nThere is a tradition of BMW M models appearing as safety cars at motor racing events. Since 1999, BMW M has provided the fleet of high-performance safety cars as “Official Car of MotoGP™”, the top level of motorcycle racing. As of 2025, this concept will now be mirrored in virtual motor racing.\n\nAn overview of the iRacing Special Event calendar:\n\n18th January 2025 – 24 Hours of Daytona (USA)\n\n12th February 2025 – 12 Hours of Bathurst (AUS)\n\n22nd March 2025 – 12 Hours of Sebring (USA)\n\n7th June 2025 – Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER)\n\n28th June 2025– Six Hours of Watkins Glen (USA)\n\n12th July 2025 – 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL)\n\n6th September 2025 – 6 Hours of Indianapolis (USA)\n\n4th October 2025 – Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta (USA)\n\n15th November 2025 – Suzuka 1000 km (JPN)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

After the 2024 season, the paths of BMW M works driver Maxime Martin (BEL) and BMW M Motorsport will part ways. The 38-year-old will leave the Munich-based works line-up at his own request to pursue new challenges. This marks the end of a long and successful collaboration that began when Martin made a name for himself as a young talent in the BMW M Sports Trophy.\n\nThanks to his impressive performances in BMW M Motorsport’s customer racing programme, Martin earned his place in the works driver line-up, joining for the first time in 2013. He initially competed as a regular driver for BMW M Team RLL in the American Le Mans Series before moving to DTM from 2014 to 2017. In 2016, he celebrated victory at his home race, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), driving the BMW M6 GT3 for ROWE Racing. In 2018, the Belgian moved to Aston Martin but returned to BMW M Motorsport as a works driver in the 2023 season.\n\nDriving the BMW M4 GT3, the GT specialist continued to achieve success. Alongside Dries Vanthoor (BEL), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), and Marco Wittmann (GER), he secured a podium finish at the 2023 24 Hours Nürburgring (GER), finishing in second place with ROWE Racing. At BMW M Team WRT, Martin formed a strong duo in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 with Valentino Rossi (ITA) for two years. Highlights included victories in the GT World Challenge Europe at Rossi’s home race at Misano (ITA) in 2023 and 2024. In the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC), Martin, Rossi, and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) reached the podium twice this season in the LMGT3 class. This was complemented by appearances in the BMW M Hybrid V8 with BMW M Team RLL in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “On behalf of the entire BMW M Motorsport family, I would like to thank Maxime Martin for the many years we have spent together. He began his successful career in the BMW M Sports Trophy and was a key and integral part of our works driver line-up for a long time. During these years, he was one of the defining faces of our programmes, and we fondly remember the successes we achieved together in both endurance and sprint racing. However, we value not only his sporting skills but also his wonderful personality. He has been a tremendous asset to the BMW M Motorsport family in every aspect. We wish Maxime all the best for his future and look forward to seeing him again, though as a competitor, but still as a friend.”\n\nMaxime Martin: “BMW M Motorsport has played a significant role in my career from the very beginning, and I look back fondly on everything we achieved together – from my first successes in DTM and 24-hour races to the recent victories with the BMW M4 GT3. I am very grateful for the time we spent together and for my seven years as a BMW M works driver. I wish BMW M Motorsport great success in the future, and the brand will always remain a part of me. But now it’s time for me to take on new challenges.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Au revoir, Maxime.

The development of the first #Neue Klasse series production model is on the finishing straight: prototypes of the next-generation BMW iX3 are currently undergoing extensive testing in Miramas, southern France. The Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) will celebrate its world premiere at the #IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich in September and roll off the production line at the new BMW Group plant in #Debrecen (Hungary) starting at the end of the year. “Longer range, faster charging, an all-new display and operating concept, and the intelligence of four superbrains are the distinguishing features of the Neue Klasse. With the upcoming BMW iX3 – the first model of the new car generation – we are introducing fundamental technology upgrades with the clear aim of raising the typical BMW driving pleasure to a whole new level,” says Mike Reichelt, Head of Neue Klasse BMW. “With the all-new #BMW iX3, we bring our revolutionary technologies into series production for the first time, and we can hardly wait to see it in action on the road. All future BMW models, regardless of powertrain type, will benefit from the innovations and technology clusters of the Neue Klasse.\" The new technologies at a glance:\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive: “Hands on the Wheel, Eyes on the Road”. The BMW Panoramic iDrive shows all relevant driving information in the driver’s ideal line of sight and maximizes ergonomic efficiency and safety. Four elements come together to make a unique user experience:\n\nThe BMW Panoramic iDrive runs under the BMW Operating System X, also a new development. It offers extensive customizability, intelligent support for the driver and extensive software updates. BMW’s motto “Hands on the Wheel, Eyes on the Road” is redefined with a well-balanced mix of physical controls and digital functions. BMW Panoramic iDrive will ensure user-friendly and intuitive operation in every vehicle segment and with every powertrain concept. Next generation of electric powertrains. The high-voltage battery concept for the 6th generation of BMW eDrive technology (Gen6) is fundamentally new, and together with the revised electric drive system portfolio, offers an optimum solution for all vehicle segments. The Gen6 system will be making its debut in the BMW iX3 and will then be rolled out across all vehicle segments.The centerpiece of the high-voltage battery – the BMW cylindrical battery cell – has an energy density of 20 per cent greater that the prismatic cells previously used. The cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery, which plays an important role in the body structure of Neue Klasse models. Charge faster, drive further.The Gen6 introduces a major leap forward for our customers and the BMW iX3 is the first to benefit. With 400kW maximum charging, our customers can add over 350km* maximum (WLTP) to their vehicle’s range in just 10 minutes. Gen6 technology allows users to monitor the charging performance and curve live via the My BMW App. 800V technology is paving the way for rapid charging. Charging at 400V DC charging stations will, of course, still be possible.The high energy content of the high-voltage battery, together with the efficient design of the powertrain and the overall vehicle, enables a range of up to 800km (WLTP). Further charging-related innovations.Making the charging process even more user friendly is the intelligent charging flap, which detects when the driver is intending to stop to charge the car and opens (and then closes) automatically. One of the triggers for opening the flap is AI-assisted: if the customer approaches a familiar or learned charging point, the progress towards it reveals an intention to charge and the flap opens. The SoP of the new BMW iX3 will also introduce extensive bidirectional charging functions – to-Load, to-Home and to-Grid:Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) turns the vehicle into a powerful mobile powerbank (up to 3.7kW in Europe) and supplies energy for one or several consumers, wherever customers need it. Bidirectional charging capability turns the BMW iX3 into an at-home energy storage unit. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) helps customers to reduce costs. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) sets new standards for the integration of the vehicle into the energy market. Both functions contribute to lowering emissions and increasing the use of regenerative energy sources. In this way, the BMW Group demonstrates that it is part of the solution as we work towards energy transformation. Providing the key to bidirectional charging alongside the technology involved, the new BMW Wallbox (DC) offers 19.2kW charging and discharging depending on the market. The BMW charging equipment has been redesigned and is now easier to use, and now also includes selected adapters e.g. for vehicle-to-load (V2L) use cases. The BMW driving experience with the Heart of Joy. The level in sheer driving pleasure. The \"superbrain\" Heart of Joy in the Neue Klasse raises driving dynamics to a new level. Together with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack, the Heart of Joy is pivotal to powertrain, brakes, recuperation and sub-functions of the steering system. It processes information ten times faster* than previous systems and therefore responds more directly than ever to the driver’s command. Fewer control inputs are required, directional stability is more precise and stable. As a result, the vehicle develops consistent and reproducible cornering characteristics and can be steered intuitively. Powertrain and braking functions also work together harmoniously to decelerate the vehicle. Recuperation can be used across the whole speed range down to a standstill. Indeed, in 98 percent of cases, the vehicle can be brought to a standstill without applying the friction brakes – without noise or jolts. The Heart of Joy and BMW Dynamic Performance Control raise the BMW driving experience to a new level – from standstill to dynamic limits. Further development of driver assistance systems using the intelligent high-performance computer “Superbrain of Automated Driving” BMW Group’s latest driver assistance systems are among the world’s best. The new BMW iX3 ushers in the rollout of the next technology generation. This is in keeping with BMW’s ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) philosophy: “Always smart, symbiotic, and safe”. The BMW Group merges the proven, rule-based assistance system with a new system based on AI. In an optimum symbiosis, this combination supports the driver even more precisely and reliably in challenging situations on the road. The Superbrain of Automated Driving pools all customer functions for automated driving and has a 20 times faster processing speed than the previous system. The new automated driving and parking functions are based on cutting-edge sensor, software, processor, and mobile communications technology. The basic model of the BMW iX3 offers functions like lane change warning, road priority warning, safe exit, and assisted view. Safe exit uses side-mounted radars to monitor traffic next to the car while stopping and warns the driver of approaching objects. The new Assisted View shows the latest driving situation precisely and in detail alternatively in the Central Display, the Panoramic Vision, or 3D Head-Up Display. The motorway assistant with automatic lane change will be available with extended features in the BMW iX3. Upon request, it can assist drivers from when they join a motorway to when they leave it and allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods. This assistant remains active even during automated motorway changes along an active navigation route. The new Motorway & City Assistant helps the driver in complex driving situations in urban areas, e.g. through tight corners or roundabouts. It brakes automatically at red traffic lights and moves off again or sounds an audible signal when lights turn green. Symbiotic driver assistance, as it is known, enables perfect interaction between tech and driver regarding both comfort and safety functions, and creates a seamless transition between cooperative steering and – a world first – cooperative braking. When the function is active, the driver can influence the system at any time without causing the assistant to be switched off by turning the steering wheel or applying brakes just a little in order to adjust the responses of the system. The parking functions can be activated intuitively and offer an AI-based selection of parking assistance services, parking space recognition, maneuver planning, and an improved parking experience. Extended monitoring functions help the driver to avoid damage to the vehicle while parking the car. Neue Klasse innovations are AI-based, smart and update-compatible. Thanks to the all-new electronics and software architecture with four superbrains (high-performance computers), the new BMW iX3 is now noticeably more intelligent in everyday situations – e.g. with the advanced driver assistance systems and improved voice assistant BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. Due to the powerful BMW Cloud, the new electronics and software architecture of the new vehicle generation is ready for numerous smart features, which customers can benefit from via over-the-air updates after the market launch. A large number of the patent applications filed by BMW in recent years have come about as part of the development of technologies for the Neue Klasse – e.g. in the projection technology for the BMW Panoramic Vision, in the innovative control functions of the Heart of Joy, in the battery management and cell contacting system of the high-voltage battery, in the new electric motor, and in the new, zonal vehicle electrical system. * As this is a development-phase prototype, the figures given are provisional.

Further charging-related innovations.Making the charging process even more user friendly is the intelligent charging flap, which detects when the driver is intending to stop to charge the car and opens (and then closes) automatically. One of the triggers for opening the flap is AI-assisted: if the customer approaches a familiar or learned charging point, the progress towards it reveals an intention to charge and the flap opens. The SoP of the new BMW iX3 will also introduce extensive bidirectional charging functions – to-Load, to-Home and to-Grid:Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) turns the vehicle into a powerful mobile powerbank (up to 3.7kW in Europe) and supplies energy for one or several consumers, wherever customers need it. Bidirectional charging capability turns the BMW iX3 into an at-home energy storage unit. Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) helps customers to reduce costs. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) sets new standards for the integration of the vehicle into the energy market. Both functions contribute to lowering emissions and increasing the use of regenerative energy sources. In this way, the BMW Group demonstrates that it is part of the solution as we work towards energy transformation. Providing the key to bidirectional charging alongside the technology involved, the new BMW Wallbox (DC) offers 19.2kW charging and discharging depending on the market. The BMW charging equipment has been redesigned and is now easier to use, and now also includes selected adapters e.g. for vehicle-to-load (V2L) use cases. The BMW driving experience with the Heart of Joy. The level in sheer driving pleasure. The \"superbrain\" Heart of Joy in the Neue Klasse raises driving dynamics to a new level. Together with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software stack, the Heart of Joy is pivotal to powertrain, brakes, recuperation and sub-functions of the steering system. It processes information ten times faster* than previous systems and therefore responds more directly than ever to the driver’s command. Fewer control inputs are required, directional stability is more precise and stable. As a result, the vehicle develops consistent and reproducible cornering characteristics and can be steered intuitively. Powertrain and braking functions also work together harmoniously to decelerate the vehicle. Recuperation can be used across the whole speed range down to a standstill. Indeed, in 98 percent of cases, the vehicle can be brought to a standstill without applying the friction brakes – without noise or jolts. The Heart of Joy and BMW Dynamic Performance Control raise the BMW driving experience to a new level – from standstill to dynamic limits. Further development of driver assistance systems using the intelligent high-performance computer “Superbrain of Automated Driving” BMW Group’s latest driver assistance systems are among the world’s best. The new BMW iX3 ushers in the rollout of the next technology generation. This is in keeping with BMW’s ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) philosophy: “Always smart, symbiotic, and safe”. The BMW Group merges the proven, rule-based assistance system with a new system based on AI. In an optimum symbiosis, this combination supports the driver even more precisely and reliably in challenging situations on the road. The Superbrain of Automated Driving pools all customer functions for automated driving and has a 20 times faster processing speed than the previous system. The new automated driving and parking functions are based on cutting-edge sensor, software, processor, and mobile communications technology. The basic model of the BMW iX3 offers functions like lane change warning, road priority warning, safe exit, and assisted view. Safe exit uses side-mounted radars to monitor traffic next to the car while stopping and warns the driver of approaching objects. The new Assisted View shows the latest driving situation precisely and in detail alternatively in the Central Display, the Panoramic Vision, or 3D Head-Up Display. The motorway assistant with automatic lane change will be available with extended features in the BMW iX3. Upon request, it can assist drivers from when they join a motorway to when they leave it and allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel for long periods. This assistant remains active even during automated motorway changes along an active navigation route. The new Motorway & City Assistant helps the driver in complex driving situations in urban areas, e.g. through tight corners or roundabouts. It brakes automatically at red traffic lights and moves off again or sounds an audible signal when lights turn green. Symbiotic driver assistance, as it is known, enables perfect interaction between tech and driver regarding both comfort and safety functions, and creates a seamless transition between cooperative steering and – a world first – cooperative braking. When the function is active, the driver can influence the system at any time without causing the assistant to be switched off by turning the steering wheel or applying brakes just a little in order to adjust the responses of the system. The parking functions can be activated intuitively and offer an AI-based selection of parking assistance services, parking space recognition, maneuver planning, and an improved parking experience. Extended monitoring functions help the driver to avoid damage to the vehicle while parking the car. Neue Klasse innovations are AI-based, smart and update-compatible. Thanks to the all-new electronics and software architecture with four superbrains (high-performance computers), the new BMW iX3 is now noticeably more intelligent in everyday situations – e.g. with the advanced driver assistance systems and improved voice assistant BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. Due to the powerful BMW Cloud, the new electronics and software architecture of the new vehicle generation is ready for numerous smart features, which customers can benefit from via over-the-air updates after the market launch. A large number of the patent applications filed by BMW in recent years have come about as part of the development of technologies for the Neue Klasse – e.g. in the projection technology for the BMW Panoramic Vision, in the innovative control functions of the Heart of Joy, in the battery management and cell contacting system of the high-voltage battery, in the new electric motor, and in the new, zonal vehicle electrical system. * As this is a development-phase prototype, the figures given are provisional.

The development of the first #Neue Klasse series production model is on the finishing straight: prototypes of the next-generation BMW iX3 are currently undergoing extensive testing in Miramas, southern France. The Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) will celebrate its world premiere at the #IAA Mobility 2025 in Munich in September and roll off the production line at the new BMW Group plant in #Debrecen (Hungary) starting at the end of the year. “Longer range, faster charging, an all-new display and operating concept, and the intelligence of four superbrains are the distinguishing features of the Neue Klasse. With the upcoming BMW iX3 – the first model of the new car generation – we are introducing fundamental technology upgrades with the clear aim of raising the typical BMW driving pleasure to a whole new level,” says Mike Reichelt, Head of Neue Klasse BMW. “With the all-new #BMW iX3, we bring our revolutionary technologies into series production for the first time, and we can hardly wait to see it in action on the road. All future BMW models, regardless of powertrain type, will benefit from the innovations and technology clusters of the Neue Klasse.\" The new technologies at a glance:\n\nBMW Panoramic iDrive: “Hands on the Wheel, Eyes on the Road”. The BMW Panoramic iDrive shows all relevant driving information in the driver’s ideal line of sight and maximizes ergonomic efficiency and safety. Four elements come together to make a unique user experience:\n\nThe BMW Panoramic iDrive runs under the BMW Operating System X, also a new development. It offers extensive customizability, intelligent support for the driver and extensive software updates. BMW’s motto “Hands on the Wheel, Eyes on the Road” is redefined with a well-balanced mix of physical controls and digital functions. BMW Panoramic iDrive will ensure user-friendly and intuitive operation in every vehicle segment and with every powertrain concept. Next generation of electric powertrains. The high-voltage battery concept for the 6th generation of BMW eDrive technology (Gen6) is fundamentally new, and together with the revised electric drive system portfolio, offers an optimum solution for all vehicle segments. The Gen6 system will be making its debut in the BMW iX3 and will then be rolled out across all vehicle segments.The centerpiece of the high-voltage battery – the BMW cylindrical battery cell – has an energy density of 20 per cent greater that the prismatic cells previously used. The cells are integrated directly into the high-voltage battery, which plays an important role in the body structure of Neue Klasse models. Charge faster, drive further.The Gen6 introduces a major leap forward for our customers and the BMW iX3 is the first to benefit. With 400kW maximum charging, our customers can add over 350km* maximum (WLTP) to their vehicle’s range in just 10 minutes.

Since its very first edition in 2012, BMW has been an official partner of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale (KMB). For the sixth Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the Kochi Biennale Foundation is curated by Nikhil Chopra with HH Art Spaces featuring 66 artists projects from more than 25 countries. The biennale opened to the public on 12 December 2025 and will last for a period of four months.\n\nMr. Hardeep Singh Brar, President & CEO, BMW Group India said, “The BMW Group India is proud to continue its partnership with the sixth edition of Kochi-Muziris Biennale, a platform that celebrates creativity, dialogue and new perspectives. Art has the power to inspire progressive thinking, and this partnership reflects our belief in innovation that moves both people and culture forward. The Biennale’s spirit of openness and exploration mirrors, BMWs philosophy of redefining possibility, and we are delighted to be a part of a movement that enriches India’s cultural landscape.”\n\nThe exhibition, the largest contemporary art biennale in South Asia and the first of its kind in India, unfolds across 29 venues in Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, Willingdon Islands and Ernakulam. It sits in conversation with a constellation of exhibitions, performances, and discursive programmes which are set in close dialogue with Kochi’s unique geographical, social and cultural ecology.\n\nEmbracing process as methodology, this edition places ‘friendship economies’ as the very scaffolding of the exhibition. The curatorial vision acknowledges bodies as a landscape of time, a vessel of labour, joy, and loss, and invites the visitors to think through ‘embodied histories’ of those that came before us and continue to live within us in the form of cells, stories and techniques.\n\nBMW Group India Cultural EngagementSince its inception, BMW India has participated in leading cultural engagements across the country. In 2007, two BMW Art Cars created by world renowned artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were presented at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai. BMW Art Cars by Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Sandro Chia and Cesar Manrique have been exclusively showcased at various editions of the India Art Fair. “The Future is Born of Art” is a unique initiative by BMW India and India Art Fair which aims to propel emerging Indian artists and further BMW Group’s commitment to promote art, sustainability, and innovation. In 2012-13, the innovative BMW Guggenheim Lab came to India.

This vital and dynamic partnership has been instrumental in shaping the Biennale into a global cultural landmark. BMW Group’s continued commitment, even in uncertain times, highlights its profound belief in the power of art and culture to unite and inspire.\n\nAbout the Kochi-Muziris BiennaleKochi-Muziris Biennale is India’s ﬁrst-ever biennial of international contemporary art and its story is unique to India’s current reality—its political, social and artistic landscape. It began as a government initiative, when the Department of Cultural Aﬀairs of the Government of Kerala approached two artists—Riyas Komu and Bose Krishnamachari—to help organize an international platform for art in India. The challenge was proportionate to the ambition of the project. A biennial had never gotten past the conceptual stage in India before. There was no existing infrastructure necessary for an exhibition of this scale—no spaces and no institutional support structures.\n\nWith the support of the government, private patrons, and local businesses the Biennale found spaces and opened them up for art. The Indian art community has been growing rapidly and is emerging onto the world stage, and the international arts community oﬀered their support in sending art and artists to participate in Kochi. Artists became the spokespersons and activists for the biennale.\n\nAbout Nikhil ChopraNikhil Chopra’s artistic practice interweaves live art, drawing, photography, sculpture and installations. His performances, largely improvised, dwell on identity and its construction, autobiography and authorship, the pose and\n\nself-portraiture. Nikhil combines everyday life, memory and collective history; daily acts such as eating, resting, washing and dressing, in tandem with the act and discipline of making large-scale drawings in situ become the process of making an artwork.\n\nNikhil’s works have been included in major exhibitions including Documenta 14, the12th Sharjah Biennale, the 12th Havana Biennale; the 2nd Kochi-Muziris Biennale and the 53rd Venice Biennale amongst others. He has also shown works and performed at the Gropius Bau, Berlin; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester; New Art Exchange, Nottingham; , SFMOMA, San Francisco; Artsonje, Seoul; Museum of Contemporary Art, Yinchuan, China; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Astrup Fearnley Museum, Oslo, Norway; Indian Highway, Serpentine Gallery, London, UK; Carriageworks, Sydney; and Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi.\n\nNikhil Chopra was born in Kolkata in 1974, and lives in Goa where he runs HH Art Spaces with partners. After studying at the Faculty of Fine Arts at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Vadodara, India, the artist continued his studies in the United States in 2003, returning to India in 2005 with a Master’s degree from Ohio State University.\n\nAbout HH Art SpacesHH Art Spaces, Goa, was founded in 2014 by Nikhil Chopra and Romain Loustau, both live art and performance artists. HH Art Spaces is a movement, and currently includes the shared vision, voices, rigor, and energies of a collective of artists and cultural practitioners. Key founding and partner members of the organization are: Madhavi Gore, Shivani Gupta, and Shaira Sequeira Shetty. HH Art Spaces fosters an ethos of collaborations, residencies and interdisciplinary exchanges within art and culture; and has worked with artists and organizations locally, regionally and internationally.\n\nOver the years, HH Art Spaces has developed a rich archive of visual, sonic, installation, and live art and performance work, in South Asia. HH Art Spaces promotes artists and produces exhibitions and artist residencies, talks and workshops, in contemporary and traditional artistic practice-based research, bridging transdisciplinary practices through collaborations and partnerships.

The challenge was proportionate to the ambition of the project. A biennial had never gotten past the conceptual stage in India before. There was no existing infrastructure necessary for an exhibition of this scale—no spaces and no institutional support structures.\n\nWith the support of the government, private patrons, and local businesses the Biennale found spaces and opened them up for art. The Indian art community has been growing rapidly and is emerging onto the world stage, and the international arts community oﬀered their support in sending art and artists to participate in Kochi. Artists became the spokespersons and activists for the biennale.\n\nAbout Nikhil ChopraNikhil Chopra’s artistic practice interweaves live art, drawing, photography, sculpture and installations. His performances, largely improvised, dwell on identity and its construction, autobiography and authorship, the pose and\n\nself-portraiture. Nikhil combines everyday life, memory and collective history; daily acts such as eating, resting, washing and dressing, in tandem with the act and discipline of making large-scale drawings in situ become the process of making an artwork.\n\nNikhil’s works have been included in major exhibitions including Documenta 14, the12th Sharjah Biennale, the 12th Havana Biennale; the 2nd Kochi-Muziris Biennale and the 53rd Venice Biennale amongst others. He has also shown works and performed at the Gropius Bau, Berlin; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester; New Art Exchange, Nottingham; , SFMOMA, San Francisco; Artsonje, Seoul; Museum of Contemporary Art, Yinchuan, China; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Astrup Fearnley Museum, Oslo, Norway; Indian Highway, Serpentine Gallery, London, UK; Carriageworks, Sydney; and Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi.\n\nNikhil Chopra was born in Kolkata in 1974, and lives in Goa where he runs HH Art Spaces with partners. After studying at the Faculty of Fine Arts at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Vadodara, India, the artist continued his studies in the United States in 2003, returning to India in 2005 with a Master’s degree from Ohio State University.\n\nAbout HH Art SpacesHH Art Spaces, Goa, was founded in 2014 by Nikhil Chopra and Romain Loustau, both live art and performance artists.

Art has the power to inspire progressive thinking, and this partnership reflects our belief in innovation that moves both people and culture forward. The Biennale’s spirit of openness and exploration mirrors, BMWs philosophy of redefining possibility, and we are delighted to be a part of a movement that enriches India’s cultural landscape.”\n\nThe exhibition, the largest contemporary art biennale in South Asia and the first of its kind in India, unfolds across 29 venues in Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, Willingdon Islands and Ernakulam. It sits in conversation with a constellation of exhibitions, performances, and discursive programmes which are set in close dialogue with Kochi’s unique geographical, social and cultural ecology.\n\nEmbracing process as methodology, this edition places ‘friendship economies’ as the very scaffolding of the exhibition. The curatorial vision acknowledges bodies as a landscape of time, a vessel of labour, joy, and loss, and invites the visitors to think through ‘embodied histories’ of those that came before us and continue to live within us in the form of cells, stories and techniques.\n\nBMW Group India Cultural EngagementSince its inception, BMW India has participated in leading cultural engagements across the country. In 2007, two BMW Art Cars created by world renowned artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were presented at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai. BMW Art Cars by Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Sandro Chia and Cesar Manrique have been exclusively showcased at various editions of the India Art Fair. “The Future is Born of Art” is a unique initiative by BMW India and India Art Fair which aims to propel emerging Indian artists and further BMW Group’s commitment to promote art, sustainability, and innovation. In 2012-13, the innovative BMW Guggenheim Lab came to India. Based at Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum and conducted at six different sites in Mumbai, the lab organised six weeks of free programmes with diverse audiences and communities addressing the challenges and conditions of the urban city.\n\nSince 2012, BMW has partnered with the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the contemporary art exhibition, which brings international artists to India and creates a global platform for Indian artists.

This definitely includes the SRO racing series in Europe and North America. In the GT World Challenge Europe, Team WRT is doing a fantastic job – as is Paradine Competition. This top work is reflected in the race results and overall standings. Truly exceptional is the current record of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GT World Challenge America with four wins in six races, as well as in GT America. The BMW M4 GT4 EVO is a guarantee of victory in GT4 America and also achieves successes in the extremely competitive European GT4 series. Congratulations to all teams and drivers! Next weekend, we are preparing our new entry-level car, the BMW M2 Racing, for the 24h Nürburgring at the Qualifiers. Starting in 2026, we will complete our outstanding portfolio of race cars for all categories. I am very proud of how we are currently presenting ourselves as BMW M Motorsport in the customer segment. Let's keep it going.\"\n\nGT World Challenge Europe: Team WRT leads overall standings.\n\nTeam WRT has left its mark on the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS season so far. After three race weekends, the Belgian racing team leads all standings – in the Sprint Cup, the Endurance Cup, and the overall ranking from both cups. Last weekend, BMW M works drivers Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Charles Weerts (BEL) won the Sunday race of the Sprint Cup at Zandvoort (NED) at the wheel of the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. With their second triumph following the Endurance Cup success at Le Castellet (FRA) together with BMW M works driver Ugo de Wilde (BEL) in April, they have now taken the lead in the Sprint standings in addition to the overall and Endurance standings. This applies to both the driver and team standings.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to share the car with Charles,\" said van der Linde after the Zandvoort victory. \"We had a perfect start to the season and are leading the overall standings. I am really proud of the team because we didn't have the fastest car here at Zandvoort.\" The guarantee of victory on Sunday was a fantastic pit stop by the WRT crew, which brought the car from sixth place to the top. Already on Saturday, van der Linde and Weerts improved from 19th on the grid to fifth place, securing important points. Team WRT deservedly won the Pitstop Challenge. \"We know our guys are the best and always bring us back into the game with their fast pit stops,\" said Weerts.\n\nIn the Gold Cup, BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) and Al Faisal al Zubair (OMA) drove the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from AlManar Racing by WRT to third place twice on the Zandvoort podium. At Brands Hatch (GBR), the two had won the Sunday race. They are in second place in the Gold Cup overall standings. In the Silver Cup, Mex Jansen and Maxime Oosten (both NED) finished second on Sunday at Zandvoort in the #992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paradine Competition. They had achieved the same result on Saturday at Brands Hatch. In the Bronze Cup, BMW M works drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Darren Leung (GBR) finished second in the Saturday race in the Paradine Competition sister car.\n\nGT World Challenge America: BMW M4 GT3 EVO dominates at Sebring.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT3 EVO dominated the third race weekend of the GT World Challenge America powered by AWS at Sebring (USA). This was especially true for BMW M works driver Connor De Phillippi and Kenton Koch (both USA), who won both races in the #99 car from Random Vandals Racing and took the lead in the overall standings. Overall, the duo has already won four of the six season races. \"It was a fantastic, actually even a dream weekend for Random Vandals Racing,\" said De Phillippi. \"We made no mistakes, the car was great to drive, and we did a perfect job without showing any weaknesses.\" Koch added: \"I am very happy to work with BMW M Motorsport and Random Vandals Racing. I know people say that quickly, but I really mean it. I am in an incredibly good position that many others would surely like to be in.\" In the second BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Random Vandals Racing, BMW M works driver Bill Auberlen and Varun Choksey (both USA) finished third in the first race in Sebring.\n\nIn the Pro-Am category, BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Justin Rothberg (both USA) triumphed with their #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Turner Motorsport in the Sunday race. On Saturday, they had finished third. Thanks to the strong points haul, including the second win of the season, the duo defended the lead in the Pro-Am overall standings.\n\nGT4 America: BMW M Motorsport teams dominate.\n\nBMW M Motorsport dominated GT4 America at Sebring (USA) and celebrated two triple victories. Kevin Boehm and Kenton Koch (both USA) triumphed in both races in the #97 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from Random Vandals Racing, celebrating their second and third wins of the season after winning the second race at Sonoma (USA). Koch thus had a perfect weekend with double victories in GT3 and GT4. Colin Garrett and Zac Anderson (both USA, Auto Technic Racing) completed the Silver-Class podium at Sebring with two third-places, jumping onto the podium for the second and third time after their triumph at the season opener.\n\nRandom Vandals Racing also had reason to celebrate in the Pro-Am category. Right behind their teammates Koch and Boehm, Josh Green and Sam Craven (both USA) finished second overall in both races in the #94 BMW M4 GT4 EVO, celebrating two class victories.

The winner of the 2025 BMW M Award in MotoGP™ is Marc Márquez. The record holder in this special competition has once again claimed the coveted prize for the fastest qualifier of the season – for the eighth time. The Spaniard had already made history by winning the BMW M Award seven years in a row between 2013 and 2019. Now Márquez has returned to the top. His prize this year is the new BMW M2 CS (combined fuel consumption: 10.0 l/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G)*. The presentation of the winner’s car took place on Saturday after the final qualifying session of the season at Valencia, Spain, where Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports, and Axel Mittler, Marketing Manager at BMW M GmbH, handed over the keys.\n\nAfter several challenging years, Márquez made an impressive comeback in 2025. He dominated the season and clinched the world championship title early, already in Japan at the 17th of 22 rounds. In the BMW M Award standings, Márquez collected so many points – with eight pole positions and five additional front-row starts – that he could no longer be caught, even though he missed the final four rounds of the season due to injury. Márquez won the 2025 BMW M Award with 351 points, finishing eight points ahead of his brother Álex Márquez in second place. As in the races, MotoGP™ riders receive points for the BMW M Award according to their qualifying positions. The winner at the end of the season is awarded an exclusive high-performance automobile from BMW M. This coveted award has been presented every year since 2003.\n\nCarmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna Sports, said: “Congratulations to Marc Márquez. He has made an impressive comeback this season and once again demonstrated why he is one of the greatest MotoGP riders of all time. From 2013 onwards, we handed him the keys to a new BMW M car seven times in a row at the season finale – and I am delighted that we can do so again this year. His performance and talent have been outstanding, and he truly deserves the BMW M Award this season. At the same time, my thanks go to BMW M GmbH. For 22 years now, the BMW M Award has been an integral part of MotoGP, making it a genuine tradition. It’s a special recognition of what our riders and their teams achieve weekend after weekend in qualifying.”\n\nAxel Mittler added: “What Marc Márquez has shown this season was simply incredible. Congratulations to our record winner: seven consecutive victories were already historic, but his eighth BMW M Award triumph is truly remarkable, especially considering that he built such a big lead in the standings that even his injury couldn’t stop him from winning. We are delighted to add our new BMW M2 CS to Marc’s collection of BMW M Award winners’ cars. This high-performance sports car once again raises the benchmark in its segment, and with its pure performance, dynamics, and agility, it’s the perfect winner’s car for the currently world’s best MotoGP rider. We wish Marc lots of fun with his prize – and a smooth recovery, so that he can thrill us again next season!”\n\nMarc Márquez said: “It took a few years, but I’m really happy to see my name back on the list of BMW M Award winners. This season has been a dream for me, even though I obviously didn’t imagine it ending with a shoulder injury that made me miss the final races. But it’s great to be here in Valencia and to be recognized once again as the fastest qualifier – for the eighth time! I actually found out I’d won while I was out buying fruit – my brother Álex didn’t manage the result he needed in the penultimate qualifying in Portimão to keep the contest open. But I promised him he’ll get to drive the car too! For us, it’s always something special when our performances on the track are recognized in this way. Now it’s time for the winter break, and my goal for 2026 is clear: to win the world championship, and this award, again!”\n\nThe 2025 winner’s car, the BMW M2 CS, is the latest exclusive special model from BMW M GmbH in the premium compact high-performance sports car segment. It impresses with outstanding agility, significantly increased performance, exceptional driving dynamics, and particularly sporty design features.

The fifth event of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team to Most in the Czech Republic. There, reigning world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) on the BMW M 1000 RR proved to be – at least almost – unbeatable. ‘El Turco’ was the fastest in all practice sessions, secured pole position, won race one and the Superpole race, clocked the fastest lap in all three races, and set new lap records. In the second main race, it looked like he would complete the hat-trick until just a few metres from the finish. Only shortly before the finish line was long-time rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) able to overtake, and Razgatlioglu had to settle for second place by a mere 0.027 seconds. Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) had double bad luck at Most. In Superpole, he was among the many riders whose fastest lap was cancelled due to a yellow flag, leaving him 15th on the grid. At the start of race one, he was involved in a multi-rider crash through no fault of his own and had to retire. On Sunday, van der Mark finished 13th and 14th.\n\nReactions after the Most round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “What a weekend! We’re extremely proud of the entire team – those at the track, at home, and in the test team. Everyone has worked very hard since Cremona, and that has put us in a position to take pole position and two wins. We only missed out on race two by a few hundredths of a second. Of course, that hurt, but overall, the performance Toprak showed this weekend was incredible. What he delivered on the bike was simply outstanding. All in all, we now head into the next races at Misano with a positive outlook. We’ve managed to reduce the points gap in both the riders’ and manufacturers’ standings. Mickey was strong in the practice sessions, but unfortunately unlucky in Superpole, which meant he had to start from the back and couldn’t fight his way forward properly. Now we go to Misano knowing that we can fight again and that we’re right in the mix. We’re looking forward to Italy and will give everything to close the gap even further.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was once again an intense weekend here at Most, which is practically a home race for us. It’s just a few hours’ drive from Munich, and there were many fans from Germany here. Friday’s practice sessions were run under very tricky mixed conditions. Still, Toprak managed them very solidly and showed very strong race pace during a simulation in FP2. That the BMW M 1000 RR has this kind of pace was confirmed on Saturday and Sunday. In Superpole, Toprak translated the bike’s performance into a perfect lap time. What followed were three extremely strong races from him. Mickey showed good performance in free practice. His weekend was heavily affected by the complicated qualifying, with his final fast lap being deleted due to yellow flags. That meant he had no chance to start further up the grid. His starting position made all his races difficult, and he couldn’t show his or the bike’s full potential. We’ll see him come back stronger at Misano. Overall, it was a successful weekend for us with two wins and a second place – only 0.027 seconds behind. We’ve shown that we can continue to fight with Ducati and Nicolò Bulega for the World Championship, even though they still seem to have an advantage on the straights after the latest fuel flow regulation changes. So we leave Most with one eye smiling – and one eye crying, because the hat-trick just didn’t happen.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The weekend started amazingly for me. We took pole and won the first two races. But in the second main race, I had some bad luck. It was not a technical problem but in the last few sectors on the final lap the bike felt strange. On the straight, I felt some cut and we lost P1. Anyway, it was a hard effort by everyone and we did a really good weekend. I’m just a bit unhappy that we did not do three wins but only two. Overall, it was not bad, we collected important points for the championship and everything else, we will see at the next race.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I started the weekend quite well. In FP1 and FP2, we had a strong pace and good lap times. My feeling with the bike was good, also in FP3 I felt confident. In Superpole, they unfortunately took my lap away because of the yellow flag. So I was starting from P15 which isn’t ideal on this track where it is hard to pass and the differences are so small. In the first race, I was just unlucky in turn 1, being taken out by someone elses crash. It was a big shame but it happens. In the Superpole race, I tried to get into the top nine so I had to pass but unfortunately could not make it. So I started from 15th again.

The fifth event of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team to Most in the Czech Republic. There, reigning world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) on the BMW M 1000 RR proved to be – at least almost – unbeatable. ‘El Turco’ was the fastest in all practice sessions, secured pole position, won race one and the Superpole race, clocked the fastest lap in all three races, and set new lap records. In the second main race, it looked like he would complete the hat-trick until just a few metres from the finish. Only shortly before the finish line was long-time rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) able to overtake, and Razgatlioglu had to settle for second place by a mere 0.027 seconds. Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) had double bad luck at Most. In Superpole, he was among the many riders whose fastest lap was cancelled due to a yellow flag, leaving him 15th on the grid. At the start of race one, he was involved in a multi-rider crash through no fault of his own and had to retire. On Sunday, van der Mark finished 13th and 14th.\n\nReactions after the Most round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “What a weekend! We’re extremely proud of the entire team – those at the track, at home, and in the test team. Everyone has worked very hard since Cremona, and that has put us in a position to take pole position and two wins. We only missed out on race two by a few hundredths of a second. Of course, that hurt, but overall, the performance Toprak showed this weekend was incredible. What he delivered on the bike was simply outstanding. All in all, we now head into the next races at Misano with a positive outlook. We’ve managed to reduce the points gap in both the riders’ and manufacturers’ standings. Mickey was strong in the practice sessions, but unfortunately unlucky in Superpole, which meant he had to start from the back and couldn’t fight his way forward properly. Now we go to Misano knowing that we can fight again and that we’re right in the mix. We’re looking forward to Italy and will give everything to close the gap even further.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was once again an intense weekend here at Most, which is practically a home race for us. It’s just a few hours’ drive from Munich, and there were many fans from Germany here. Friday’s practice sessions were run under very tricky mixed conditions. Still, Toprak managed them very solidly and showed very strong race pace during a simulation in FP2. That the BMW M 1000 RR has this kind of pace was confirmed on Saturday and Sunday. In Superpole, Toprak translated the bike’s performance into a perfect lap time. What followed were three extremely strong races from him. Mickey showed good performance in free practice. His weekend was heavily affected by the complicated qualifying, with his final fast lap being deleted due to yellow flags. That meant he had no chance to start further up the grid. His starting position made all his races difficult, and he couldn’t show his or the bike’s full potential. We’ll see him come back stronger at Misano. Overall, it was a successful weekend for us with two wins and a second place – only 0.027 seconds behind. We’ve shown that we can continue to fight with Ducati and Nicolò Bulega for the World Championship, even though they still seem to have an advantage on the straights after the latest fuel flow regulation changes. So we leave Most with one eye smiling – and one eye crying, because the hat-trick just didn’t happen.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The weekend started amazingly for me. We took pole and won the first two races. But in the second main race, I had some bad luck. It was not a technical problem but in the last few sectors on the final lap the bike felt strange. On the straight, I felt some cut and we lost P1. Anyway, it was a hard effort by everyone and we did a really good weekend. I’m just a bit unhappy that we did not do three wins but only two. Overall, it was not bad, we collected important points for the championship and everything else, we will see at the next race.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I started the weekend quite well. In FP1 and FP2, we had a strong pace and good lap times. My feeling with the bike was good, also in FP3 I felt confident. In Superpole, they unfortunately took my lap away because of the yellow flag. So I was starting from P15 which isn’t ideal on this track where it is hard to pass and the differences are so small. In the first race, I was just unlucky in turn 1, being taken out by someone elses crash. It was a big shame but it happens. In the Superpole race, I tried to get into the top nine so I had to pass but unfortunately could not make it. So I started from 15th again.

With deep respect for craftsmanship, culture, and the communities that shape them, the partnership between MINI John Cooper Works and Deus Ex Machina comes to life through two customised one-off cars - rolling expressions of a lifestyle where a love of speed meets creativity and considered design. Built not just for performance, but for the people who live and breathe it.\n\n“MINI models have always been characterized by a blend of creative design and motorsport dynamics,’ explains Stefan Richmann, Head of MINI. “Thanks to our collaboration with Deus Ex Machina, we are taking this philosophy to a new level and setting exciting new trends for fans and motorsport enthusiasts. The partners are united by their “passion for machines, innovation and creativity” and an authentic relationship with their own community,” says Stefan Richmann.\n\nPurist, functional and graphic design approach.Both vehicle concepts are based on a MINI John Cooper Works model: the first, a MINI JCW Electric with up to 190 kW/258 hp, the second, a combustion engine-powered MINI JCW with 170 kW/231 hp. Each vehicles roof features a large white ‘X’, a connecting element, which signals a significant design and co-creation: the co-creation process between two iconic brands in their own right: MINI JCW x DEUS.\n\n\"In this extraordinary collaboration, we showcase two vehicles that remind us of motorsport history and successes of MINI. Every single detail has been crafted with artisanal precision and expertise. This has resulted in unique characters that are clearly perceived as belonging together through their distinctive design language and use of graphics,\" says Holger Hampf, Head of MINI Design.\n\nVisible seams, striking switches and traditional levers emphasise the mechanical character of the cockpits. The materials and colours utilised throughout the vehicles create bold contrasts: a deliberate break with high gloss. Instead of perfection, authenticity is at the forefront: designers speak of a ‘raw, handcrafted approach’ that celebrates the ‘beauty of imperfection’. On the exterior, expressive graphics consisting of numbers, geometric elements and bright colours pay homage to MINIs racing history.\n\nThe MINI JCW X DEUS one-off cars.Built as a pair - kindred in spirit, opposite in energy. One born of the coast: shaped by surfboards, sea spray, and the stripped-back rhythm of beach life. The other is forged on the track: lean, fast, and fuelled by a love of speed and precision.\n\nThe Skeg – sleek, electric, coast-bound.The electric powered show car ‘The Skeg’ is a clean, minimal and quiet rebellion, drawing on materials, technologies and philosophies from the world of surfing: Fiberglass, acceleration and minimalism.\n\nThe vehicles bodywork lands a bold first impression in a vivid yellow and silver finish - a nod to MINI’s progressive take on electric mobility. Wide fenders, an illuminated front grille, and a roof spoiler sharpen the silhouette, while semi-transparent fiberglass panels strip 15% of the car’s weight and refine its aerodynamic performance. At the rear, the Flex Tip Surf Spoiler responds to airflow much like a surfboard rides the contours of a wave. Its form draws from the concave underside of a board, redirecting movement, generating lift, and turning design into function.\n\nTension straps across the roof reference the familiar ritual of tying down a surfboard after a session, while remaining a characteristic design detail of the new MINI family, featured as an accent on the dashboard and in the 6 o'clock spoke of the steering wheel.\n\nCustom-made fiberglass elements on the roof, front, rear, and interior create a shifting play of light: translucent, strong, and responsive to time of day and environment, while the dashboard itself borrows directly from surfboard construction: lightweight, resilient, and visually distinctive.\n\nThe Interior.Inside, the analogue controls are stripped back - simple, tactile, and true to purpose, reflecting a surf culture that prioritises purpose over polish. The car resembles a mobile surf shop. An example of the thoughtful functionality is the fiberglass trays for wetsuits. The specially shaped shelves provide a practical storage solution and bring the surf culture into the interior. The neoprene upholstery in the lightweight racing bucket seats – flexible, water-repellent, and comfortable – also creates a tactile connection to surfing. The fiberglass dashboard transfers the technology of surfboard construction into the automotive sector. The oversized ‘X’ returns as a visual anchor, while Deus Collection badges and 3D-printed details in the console serve as subtle signifiers of a shared culture - one grounded in craft, connection, and the pursuit of the ride.\n\nThe Machina - loud, low, combustion-fed.The Machina, a John Cooper Works that packs a compact punch of raw mechanics and motorsport bloodline. Inspired by the aesthetics of motorsport, it stands for pure racing enthusiasm and authentic functionality.\n\nThe exterior: signature elements with links to the racing scene.The exterior design pays homage to the motorsport heritage of the MINI brand. Every characteristic feature has been carefully selected with a focus on functionality and emotional appeal.\n\nThe red, white and black paintwork, complete with bold accents and Deus lettering on the rear, makes an immediate impression. Classic widened fenders nod to racing heritage, blending form and function, while four additional headlights mounted on the bonnet pay tribute to rally sport roots. Each custom-built light pod features subtle Deus branding, offering both performance and a distinctive visual signature.\n\nAt the rear, the diffuser draws inspiration from the MINI JCW race car that tore through the legendary Nordschleife. Beyond its aggressive stance, it’s designed to optimise airflow and stability, with the centrally integrated exhaust serving as both a functional and aesthetic focal point, amplifying the engine’s sound and presence.\n\nUp front, a bespoke grille and perforated headlight surrounds enhance cooling performance, while the iconic MINI John Cooper Works light signature, complete with air intakes, anchors the car firmly in MINI’s high-performance lineage. Topping it off is a Can-Am-style rear spoiler: a bold piece of motorsport nostalgia that nods to an era when innovation in racing pushed both design and engineering to the edge.\n\nThe Interior.Inside the JCW show car, the red, white and black palette holds strong - pared-back, purposeful, and unmistakably John Cooper Works. The 5-point racing harnesses secure the driver, and ultimately become part of the driving experience, wrapping the body in precision.\n\nRaw aluminium floor plates offer more than grip, rather they echo the utilitarian aesthetic found in Deus’ custom motorcycle workshops from Sydney to Venice Beach to Canggu, grounding the car in a shared language of performance and craft.\n\nWeight-saving is built into every surface, from the stripped-back door panels marked with bold white ‘X’ motifs, to the waxed fabric dash - lightweight, durable, and finished with a lived-in patina that speaks to hands-on workmanship. Overhead, the exposed roll cage adds structure and statement in equal measure - a safety feature that nods to the car’s unfiltered racing DNA.\n\nThe show car's controls speak a clear language of functionality and directness. Every switch and every button is designed to function intuitively and reliably, even under extreme conditions.\n\nToggle switches are classic elements – no complex menus, just direct, mechanical connections between thought and action. Each button has a clear function. A classic example, the hydraulic handbrake with its large lever, acting as a direct connection between driver and vehicle - a commitment to precision and control. The JCW show car is a driving manifesto and a tribute to the motorsport DNA of the MINI brand.\n\nConcentrated creativity for two extraordinary designer pieces.In collaboration with the MINI design team, BMW Group subsidiary Designworks provided creative impetus with unconventional ideas for the project.

The oversized ‘X’ returns as a visual anchor, while Deus Collection badges and 3D-printed details in the console serve as subtle signifiers of a shared culture - one grounded in craft, connection, and the pursuit of the ride.\n\nThe Machina - loud, low, combustion-fed.The Machina, a John Cooper Works that packs a compact punch of raw mechanics and motorsport bloodline. Inspired by the aesthetics of motorsport, it stands for pure racing enthusiasm and authentic functionality.\n\nThe exterior: signature elements with links to the racing scene.The exterior design pays homage to the motorsport heritage of the MINI brand. Every characteristic feature has been carefully selected with a focus on functionality and emotional appeal.\n\nThe red, white and black paintwork, complete with bold accents and Deus lettering on the rear, makes an immediate impression. Classic widened fenders nod to racing heritage, blending form and function, while four additional headlights mounted on the bonnet pay tribute to rally sport roots. Each custom-built light pod features subtle Deus branding, offering both performance and a distinctive visual signature.\n\nAt the rear, the diffuser draws inspiration from the MINI JCW race car that tore through the legendary Nordschleife. Beyond its aggressive stance, it’s designed to optimise airflow and stability, with the centrally integrated exhaust serving as both a functional and aesthetic focal point, amplifying the engine’s sound and presence.\n\nUp front, a bespoke grille and perforated headlight surrounds enhance cooling performance, while the iconic MINI John Cooper Works light signature, complete with air intakes, anchors the car firmly in MINI’s high-performance lineage. Topping it off is a Can-Am-style rear spoiler: a bold piece of motorsport nostalgia that nods to an era when innovation in racing pushed both design and engineering to the edge.\n\nThe Interior.Inside the JCW show car, the red, white and black palette holds strong - pared-back, purposeful, and unmistakably John Cooper Works. The 5-point racing harnesses secure the driver, and ultimately become part of the driving experience, wrapping the body in precision.\n\nRaw aluminium floor plates offer more than grip, rather they echo the utilitarian aesthetic found in Deus’ custom motorcycle workshops from Sydney to Venice Beach to Canggu, grounding the car in a shared language of performance and craft.\n\nWeight-saving is built into every surface, from the stripped-back door panels marked with bold white ‘X’ motifs, to the waxed fabric dash - lightweight, durable, and finished with a lived-in patina that speaks to hands-on workmanship. Overhead, the exposed roll cage adds structure and statement in equal measure - a safety feature that nods to the car’s unfiltered racing DNA.\n\nThe show car's controls speak a clear language of functionality and directness. Every switch and every button is designed to function intuitively and reliably, even under extreme conditions.\n\nToggle switches are classic elements – no complex menus, just direct, mechanical connections between thought and action. Each button has a clear function. A classic example, the hydraulic handbrake with its large lever, acting as a direct connection between driver and vehicle - a commitment to precision and control. The JCW show car is a driving manifesto and a tribute to the motorsport DNA of the MINI brand.\n\nConcentrated creativity for two extraordinary designer pieces.In collaboration with the MINI design team, BMW Group subsidiary Designworks provided creative impetus with unconventional ideas for the project. Deus’ Creative Director, Carby Tuckwell and his wider creative cohort oversaw the striking exterior graphics of the unique cars - led by Matt Willey – and complimented the work - an outcome that truly reflects extraordinary design dynamics and remarkable solutions across the two vehicles.\n\n“Deus has had a longstanding creative partnership with Matt - one powered by a true respect for the power of design and art. Having him involved in this project, for us, was a no-brainer - he worked closely with myself and the Deus team on our first creative project that was splashed across a MINI car in 2023.” - Carby Tuckwell, Deus Co-Founder & Creative Director\n\nDeus x Matt Willey: The fascination of historic racing.Deus’ Carby Tuckwell and Matt Willey have been working together since 2015. United by their fascination with classic motorsport liveries, they created a historic Mini Cooper S racing car in 2023 with a special paint finish designed by Willey. The design references the glorious and victorious history of the classic Mini at the Monte Carlo Rally, including the number 37, with which Paddy Hopkirk started in 1964 and achieved the British small car's first overall victory in the most famous of all rallies.\n\nMatt Willey, a native of England who lives in Brooklyn, became a partner at the renowned design firm Pentagram after five years as art director of the New York Times Magazine.\n\nA Shared Vision Becomes Fabric.Woven into the partnership is a capsule MINI x Deus Ex Machina apparel collection, set to launch on September 8, 2025, at IAA in Munich, before becoming available globally via Deus Ex Machina’s e-commerce and retail network. Designed exclusively for the collaboration, the range draws on the shared DNA of both brands - precision engineering, timeless styling, and obsessive attention to detail. High-grade materials and thoughtful tailoring provide the benchmark for the range, with every garment reflecting Deus’ commitment to craftsmanship and its reputation for creating apparel that moves between lifestyle and legacy. With a deep understanding of storytelling through design, Deus brings authenticity and cultural relevance to the capsule, bridging the worlds of motorsport and modern apparel in a way that feels both current and enduring.\n\nYou can be first after me.The highlight of the MINI JCW x DEUS project's communication campaign will be the world premiere at IAA Mobility 2025 with the exclusive MINI JCW x DEUS Night on 6 September at the MINI Pavilion.

The BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024 returned to its roots in Africa, with Namibia serving as the breathtaking backdrop for this ninth edition of the legendary event.\n\nOver the course of six days, 22 teams from around the world—comprising 16 men’s and 6 women’s teams—traversed an adventurous 1,350-kilometer route through some of Namibia's most challenging and diverse terrains.\n\nThis year's event was not merely a competition but a true test of skill, endurance, and camaraderie, reflecting the essence of the GS spirit.\n\nThe event kicked off with teams navigating vast dry savanna areas, towering canyons, rocky trails, and dry riverbeds. Each day presented unique challenges designed to push the limits of both the riders and their machines. Participants faced a series of special stages that tested their off-road riding capabilities, mechanical knowledge, navigation skills, intelligence, and teamwork, all while demonstrating the rugged versatility of the BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike.\n\nWith nearly 190 participants—including riders, marshals, mechanics, medical teams, and media representatives - from 34 nations, the GS Trophy 2024 was a global celebration of adventure motorcycling. It brought together 120 motorcycles and 32 support vehicles, creating a vivid tableau of international unity and shared passion for exploration.\n\nReturning to Africa, where the GS Trophy first began in 2008, this year’s edition paid homage to the spirit of adventure that has defined the event since its inception. After traveling through the challenging terrains of Tunisia, Southern Africa, Patagonia, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia, New Zealand, and Albania in previous editions, the GS Trophy came full circle, embracing Namibia's rugged beauty.\n\nTeam Germany Reclaims the Trophy.The final day of the BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024 was charged with excitement as Team Germany stood on the brink of an extraordinary achievement. With South Africa having claimed the last four editions—in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 - Germany was eager to carve their own place in the event’s storied history.\n\nHaving previously won the GS Trophy in 2012, Team Germany was no stranger to success. This year, they returned with renewed determination, ready to showcase their skill and teamwork on Namibia’s demanding and diverse terrain. From the challenging riverbed of the Khan River to the rugged ascents of Bosua Pass, the German team met every challenge with precision and resilience, distinguishing themselves through their consistent performance.\n\nReflecting on their victory, Christopher Michi (181) expressed the team’s disbelief and joy: “It’s an indescribable feeling. We came here to give our best, but actually to stand here as winners, it’s surreal.”\n\nThroughout the competition, their strategic approach and unwavering focus allowed them to steadily gain points, ultimately securing their lead. “We’ve trained for this moment for so long,” said Niko Wecker (182). “Every special stage, every obstacle, we faced it together as a team. South Africa has set the bar incredibly high for so many years, and to reach this milestone is just incredible.”\n\nWhen the final results were announced, the team’s excitement was undeniable. They had accomplished what they set out to do, reclaiming the GS Trophy title. “This victory is more than just a trophy,” Jan Stahl (183) reflected. “It’s the culmination of everything we’ve worked for. The feeling of standing here, knowing we’ve made it—it’s something we’ll never forget.”\n\nThe Rise of Team International: A New Milestone for the Female Riders.After six days of relentless competition through Namibia's challenging terrains, the Female International Team emerged victorious.\n\nFrom the outset, the team demonstrated a remarkable blend of skill, teamwork, and determination. Each special stage was met with enthusiasm and grit as they navigated through the dunes, rocky passes, and technical trails that defined this year's course. Their journey was not just about the competition; it was about the bond they shared and the passion they brought to every challenge.\n\n“I am beyond thrilled! This feels like a dream come true,” said Małgorzata Jakubiak (321), reflecting on their victory. “We knew the competition would be tough, but to stand here as winners is something I will cherish forever. We’ve pushed our limits and learned so much along the way.”\n\nThe team's strategy and cohesion were key to their success, allowing them to consistently perform at the highest level across the various special stages. Their victory was a testament to the strength of their preparation and the support they gave each other throughout the event. “I am over the moon!” said Anna Cárdova (322). “I never imagined we would come this far, and to be standing here as winners is just surreal. It’s an honor I never expected, and I’m so grateful to be a part of this incredible experience!”\n\nThis victory is not just a win for Team International; it is a celebration of the growing presence and impact of female riders in the world of adventure motorcycling.\n\nIn 2024, BMW Motorrad continues to champion female riders by maintaining dedicated competition categories for the women's teams, featuring six two-person teams tackling the same course and challenges as the men’s teams, competing for their own Trophy. And what an incredible display of skill and spirit it has been.\n\nFearless and remarkably prepared, these women have proven themselves in terms of both skills and endurance, and their mastery of the BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike has been impressive. These competitors stand at the forefront of a growing movement of women embracing adventure motorcycling, and their stories reflect the vibrant evolution of the female GS scene.\n\nThe Adventure Unfolded: Day-by-Day Triumphs and Trials.\n\nDay 1: Midgard to Ai Aiba – A Warm Welcome.At day 1 the GS Trophy 2024 kicked off with an exhilarating ride from Midgard to Ai Aiba, introducing participants to the Namibian landscape’s diverse and challenging terrain.\n\nThe riders faced three special challenges: the Namibia Welcome Trial, a technical section near an abandoned copper mine; the AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge, a thrilling test through a sandy riverbed; and the Photo Challenge, where riders had to capture the spirit of the day in a single image. Highlighted Challenge: AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge.Set in the sandy riverbed of Omaruru river, this challenge tested the riders' endurance and control as they navigated the soft sand and unpredictable terrain. It was a demanding start that quickly reminded everyone why they were there—to push their limits and embrace the adventure.\n\nDay 2: Ai Aiba to Spitzkoppe – Into the Heart of Namibia.Riders embarked on a scenic loop around Ai Aiba’s game reserve, encountering giraffes and zebras along the way before heading towards the iconic Spitzkoppe.

It was a unique and practical test of their skills.\n\nDay 6: Midgard Loop – The Final Kilometers.The final day featured a short but technical 50 km loop around the Midgard estate, with the last special challenge, the Final Course, taking place at the lodge. It was a true test of all the skills honed throughout the event. Highlighted Challenge: Final Course.Riders had to navigate a complex series of off-camber turns, tight corners, and a slalom section, with the entire course designed to push their technical abilities to the limit. It was a fitting conclusion to a week of intense competition and camaraderie.\n\nAfter six grueling days of adventure, the event concluded with an unforgettable celebration under the Namibian sky. The final night was filled with laughter, stories, and friendship as the riders and crew gathered for the closing ceremony. A local DJ and the band “Blikweg” provided the soundtrack for the evening, their energetic performances lifting the spirits of everyone present. The night reflected the GS Trophy spirit, with participants dancing, sharing their experiences, and celebrating their accomplishments. It was a fitting end to an epic journey, leaving everyone with cherished memories of both the competition and the friendships forged along the way.\n\nSafety at the Forefront: The GS Trophy Medical Team. David Rubel, the Lead Medical Coordinator, emphasized the GS Trophy's commitment to rider safety. \"Our main goal was to ensure the response time is on par with European or U.S. standards, aiming for a maximum of 15 to 16 minutes to reach an accident site,\" said Mr. Rubel. To achieve this, the team was well-equipped with “four medical cars, including two doctors, six paramedics, and a helicopter staffed with a doctor and a paramedic.”\n\nRegarding the challenges of the terrain, David Rubel noted, “The landscape here in Namibia is unforgiving. Whether it's dehydration due to the dry climate or potential injuries from falls, we have to be prepared for anything.”\n\nWith the support of the medical team and resources like satellite communication and a well-prepared rescue chain, the GS Trophy continues to prioritize the safety of its participants without compromising the spirit of adventure.\n\nThe BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike.The BMW R 1300 GS, the official bike for the competitors, was engineered specifically for the rigors of the GS Trophy. Its heart is the new 1,300cc air/liquid-cooled boxer engine, capable of producing 143 horsepower at 7,750 rpm and 145 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm, offering a robust yet smooth power delivery.

Situated in southwestern Africa, it is bordered by Angola and Zambia to the north, Botswana to the east, South Africa to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.\n\nThe country is known for its arid climate, being the driest in sub-Saharan Africa, and its vast, rugged terrains.\n\nGeography.Namibia spans an area of about 825,615 square kilometers, making it one of the largest countries in Africa. Its landscapes are dominated by deserts, including the ancient Namib Desert along the coast and the vast Kalahari Desert in the east. The central plateau, where the capital city Windhoek is located, rises to over 1,500 meters above sea level and is bordered by mountain ranges such as the Erongo Mountains. Namibia also has significant watercourses like the Okavango, Zambezi, and Kwando rivers, which carry water from high-rainfall areas in Angola across the Kalahari, supporting some of the most biodiverse areas in the country​.\n\nDemographics.Namibia is sparsely populated, with a population density of about 3.7 people per square kilometer. The population is approximately 2.8 million people as of 2023. It is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, with most people living in urban centers near major water sources. Windhoek, the capital, is the largest city, with a population of around 477,000​.\n\nHistory and Culture.Namibia has a rich cultural heritage influenced by various groups, including the Khoisan, Damara, and Nama people, as well as the Bantu-speaking Ovambo and Herero people who migrated into the area around the 14th century. The country was a German colony in the late 19th century and was later administered by South Africa until it gained independence in 1990. This colonial history has significantly impacted the country’s architecture, language, and cultural institutions.\n\nLandscape.The Namib Desert, which extends along the entire western coast of Namibia, is one of the oldest deserts in the world and features iconic landscapes such as the towering sand dunes of Sossusvlei. The Etosha Pan, a vast salt pan in the north, turns into a shallow lake during the rainy season and supports a diverse array of wildlife. In the south, the Fish River Canyon is one of the largest canyons in the world, showcasing spectacular geological formations​.\n\nNamibia’s unique blend of desert landscapes, towering mountains, and vibrant cultures make it a truly remarkable country, offering both the harsh beauty of its arid terrains and the resilience of its people.\n\nThe Spirit Behind the Ride: Heartwarming Tales from the GS Trophy.\n\nA Family Affair: Father and Son Make GS Trophy History.In a heartwarming display of the GS Spirit, Andrea Gioia (151) and his father, Massimo Gioia (152) of Team Italy, have become the first father and son duo to compete together in the GS Trophy. When asked about their feelings upon arrival, Massimo shared, “This is a very beautiful experience with my son, Andrea.” It's clear that this event is not just another competition for them; it's a shared adventure that has deepened their bond.\n\nFor Andrea, riding alongside his father is something special. “I always use a motorbike with my father, but I never did something like this with him before,” he said, emphasizing the uniqueness of participating in such a significant event together.\n\nTheir preparation for the GS Trophy was a true family affair. “We trained with the enduro motorbike and had some sessions with BMW Academy in Italy,” Massimo explained. Being just 40 kilometers apart back home allowed them to practice together often.\n\nRiding Through Pain: Anna’s Journey to the GS Trophy.Two months before the GS Trophy, Anna Cárdova (322) of the Female International Team was thrown off her horse, dislocating her shoulder in a painful accident that nearly derailed her dreams of competing.\n\n\"I had the joint out of the shoulder for almost two hours. It was really difficult to get it back, and it was really painful,\" she shared. Despite the pain, Anna’s resolve never wavered.\n\nFollowing the accident, she underwent five weeks of rehabilitation. “I found an amazing physiotherapist who gave me exercises to fix not just the joint but all the muscles and things around the shoulder.” Her dedication to recovery was unwavering, exercising four times a day. “It was necessary because I really wanted to be here,” she emphasized.\n\nWhen she finally saw her GS Trophy bike with her name on it, the struggle and pain seemed to fade. “The feeling is amazing. It’s something exceptional, the only one in the world, and it’s here at the GS Trophy,” she said, with a sense of accomplishment. Anna’s story is a powerful reminder that with resilience and determination, no challenge is insurmountable.\n\nAn Amputee’s Triumph: Conquering the GS Trophy Challenge. Mike Booth (160), MRP (Media Related Person) for Team UK, didn’t let his prosthetic leg hold him back from experiencing the thrill of the GS Trophy. “There’s two ways of looking at an injury,” he said. “You either use it as an excuse not to do things, or you use it as a reason to just try a bit harder.” With this mindset, he faced the same grueling routes as the competitors, covering the sandy tracks, rocky canyons, and long, demanding days.\n\nDespite losing his right leg in a severe crash at the Isle of Man TT two years ago, Mike chose to push his limits rather than be defined by them. “Some days were really hard. The sandy tracks were so churned up, I thought if this gets any harder, I might have to throw in the towel,” he shared, reflecting on the physical and mental challenge of keeping up with the intense pace.\n\nEven in those tough moments, Mike’s determination never wavered. “I’m never going to be as good as I was before because my leg isn’t going to grow back,” he said, “but if you keep trying to get better, stay healthy, and try to be as strong as you possibly can, then the only limiting factor is your mindset.”\n\nFor Mike, the GS Trophy was more than just a test of endurance; it was a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to overcome adversity. His journey serves as a powerful reminder to all: “Just get out there and do it if you can.”\n\nA New Generation Rises: A Young Competitor's Story.At just 21 years old, Sardar Shahan Khan (203) of Team India is the youngest participant in this year’s GS Trophy, embodying both youth and determination. “I’ve been off-roading for half of my life,” Shahan proudly shared. “I have three GSs at home, and half of their mileage is off-road.”\n\nThis was not his first attempt to qualify. Back in 2020, he competed in the qualifier of his home country, India, for the GS Trophy but couldn’t proceed due to not having a driver’s license. “I was 17 back then. I got the best time but couldn’t compete because I didn’t have my driver’s license yet,” he recalled. As soon as he turned 18, Shahan applied for his license the very next day and continued to train rigorously. Despite narrowly missing out on a spot in the 2022 Trophy, he remained undeterred, training alongside his friends and mentors, Dev Venkatesh (202) and Anand Dharesan (201). His persistence paid off as he finally made it to the GS Trophy 2024, not just as a participant but as a member of Team India.\n\nFor Shahan, the GS Trophy is just the beginning. He plans to take on an instructor course and explore rallying professionally. “Maybe I’ll be the youngest marshal someday,” he said with a smile. It’s clear that for Shahan, this adventure is only the start of a long and promising journey.\n\nBehind the Scenes: The Making of the GS Trophy. Stefanie Grund, Senior Project Manager for the International GS Trophy 2024, shared insights into the complexity of organizing such a large-scale event. “You can prepare everything perfectly but have to be ready for any change,” she stated, reflecting on the unpredictable nature of the event planning.\n\nEach GS Trophy comes with unique challenges. “There’s always one topic which is especially difficult for the organization,” she mentioned, highlighting the helicopter logistics in Namibia as a major issue this year.\n\nStefanie also explained the extensive permitting process in Namibia: “We had to get a lot of permits like drone permits, track permits, and work visas for everyone involved.” Support from a local film production agency was crucial in navigating these challenges.\n\nBMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024, Namibia.

We’ve pushed our limits and learned so much along the way.”\n\nThe team's strategy and cohesion were key to their success, allowing them to consistently perform at the highest level across the various special stages. Their victory was a testament to the strength of their preparation and the support they gave each other throughout the event. “I am over the moon!” said Anna Cárdova (322). “I never imagined we would come this far, and to be standing here as winners is just surreal. It’s an honor I never expected, and I’m so grateful to be a part of this incredible experience!”\n\nThis victory is not just a win for Team International; it is a celebration of the growing presence and impact of female riders in the world of adventure motorcycling.\n\nIn 2024, BMW Motorrad continues to champion female riders by maintaining dedicated competition categories for the women's teams, featuring six two-person teams tackling the same course and challenges as the men’s teams, competing for their own Trophy. And what an incredible display of skill and spirit it has been.\n\nFearless and remarkably prepared, these women have proven themselves in terms of both skills and endurance, and their mastery of the BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike has been impressive.

Situated in southwestern Africa, it is bordered by Angola and Zambia to the north, Botswana to the east, South Africa to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.\n\nThe country is known for its arid climate, being the driest in sub-Saharan Africa, and its vast, rugged terrains.\n\nGeography.Namibia spans an area of about 825,615 square kilometers, making it one of the largest countries in Africa. Its landscapes are dominated by deserts, including the ancient Namib Desert along the coast and the vast Kalahari Desert in the east. The central plateau, where the capital city Windhoek is located, rises to over 1,500 meters above sea level and is bordered by mountain ranges such as the Erongo Mountains. Namibia also has significant watercourses like the Okavango, Zambezi, and Kwando rivers, which carry water from high-rainfall areas in Angola across the Kalahari, supporting some of the most biodiverse areas in the country​.\n\nDemographics.Namibia is sparsely populated, with a population density of about 3.7 people per square kilometer. The population is approximately 2.8 million people as of 2023. It is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, with most people living in urban centers near major water sources. Windhoek, the capital, is the largest city, with a population of around 477,000​.\n\nHistory and Culture.Namibia has a rich cultural heritage influenced by various groups, including the Khoisan, Damara, and Nama people, as well as the Bantu-speaking Ovambo and Herero people who migrated into the area around the 14th century. The country was a German colony in the late 19th century and was later administered by South Africa until it gained independence in 1990. This colonial history has significantly impacted the country’s architecture, language, and cultural institutions.\n\nLandscape.The Namib Desert, which extends along the entire western coast of Namibia, is one of the oldest deserts in the world and features iconic landscapes such as the towering sand dunes of Sossusvlei. The Etosha Pan, a vast salt pan in the north, turns into a shallow lake during the rainy season and supports a diverse array of wildlife. In the south, the Fish River Canyon is one of the largest canyons in the world, showcasing spectacular geological formations​.\n\nNamibia’s unique blend of desert landscapes, towering mountains, and vibrant cultures make it a truly remarkable country, offering both the harsh beauty of its arid terrains and the resilience of its people.\n\nThe Spirit Behind the Ride: Heartwarming Tales from the GS Trophy.\n\nA Family Affair: Father and Son Make GS Trophy History.In a heartwarming display of the GS Spirit, Andrea Gioia (151) and his father, Massimo Gioia (152) of Team Italy, have become the first father and son duo to compete together in the GS Trophy. When asked about their feelings upon arrival, Massimo shared, “This is a very beautiful experience with my son, Andrea.” It's clear that this event is not just another competition for them; it's a shared adventure that has deepened their bond.\n\nFor Andrea, riding alongside his father is something special. “I always use a motorbike with my father, but I never did something like this with him before,” he said, emphasizing the uniqueness of participating in such a significant event together.\n\nTheir preparation for the GS Trophy was a true family affair. “We trained with the enduro motorbike and had some sessions with BMW Academy in Italy,” Massimo explained. Being just 40 kilometers apart back home allowed them to practice together often.\n\nRiding Through Pain: Anna’s Journey to the GS Trophy.Two months before the GS Trophy, Anna Cárdova (322) of the Female International Team was thrown off her horse, dislocating her shoulder in a painful accident that nearly derailed her dreams of competing.\n\n\"I had the joint out of the shoulder for almost two hours. It was really difficult to get it back, and it was really painful,\" she shared. Despite the pain, Anna’s resolve never wavered.\n\nFollowing the accident, she underwent five weeks of rehabilitation. “I found an amazing physiotherapist who gave me exercises to fix not just the joint but all the muscles and things around the shoulder.” Her dedication to recovery was unwavering, exercising four times a day. “It was necessary because I really wanted to be here,” she emphasized.\n\nWhen she finally saw her GS Trophy bike with her name on it, the struggle and pain seemed to fade. “The feeling is amazing. It’s something exceptional, the only one in the world, and it’s here at the GS Trophy,” she said, with a sense of accomplishment. Anna’s story is a powerful reminder that with resilience and determination, no challenge is insurmountable.\n\nAn Amputee’s Triumph: Conquering the GS Trophy Challenge. Mike Booth (160), MRP (Media Related Person) for Team UK, didn’t let his prosthetic leg hold him back from experiencing the thrill of the GS Trophy. “There’s two ways of looking at an injury,” he said. “You either use it as an excuse not to do things, or you use it as a reason to just try a bit harder.” With this mindset, he faced the same grueling routes as the competitors, covering the sandy tracks, rocky canyons, and long, demanding days.\n\nDespite losing his right leg in a severe crash at the Isle of Man TT two years ago, Mike chose to push his limits rather than be defined by them. “Some days were really hard. The sandy tracks were so churned up, I thought if this gets any harder, I might have to throw in the towel,” he shared, reflecting on the physical and mental challenge of keeping up with the intense pace.\n\nEven in those tough moments, Mike’s determination never wavered. “I’m never going to be as good as I was before because my leg isn’t going to grow back,” he said, “but if you keep trying to get better, stay healthy, and try to be as strong as you possibly can, then the only limiting factor is your mindset.”\n\nFor Mike, the GS Trophy was more than just a test of endurance; it was a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to overcome adversity. His journey serves as a powerful reminder to all: “Just get out there and do it if you can.”\n\nA New Generation Rises: A Young Competitor's Story.At just 21 years old, Sardar Shahan Khan (203) of Team India is the youngest participant in this year’s GS Trophy, embodying both youth and determination. “I’ve been off-roading for half of my life,” Shahan proudly shared. “I have three GSs at home, and half of their mileage is off-road.”\n\nThis was not his first attempt to qualify. Back in 2020, he competed in the qualifier of his home country, India, for the GS Trophy but couldn’t proceed due to not having a driver’s license. “I was 17 back then. I got the best time but couldn’t compete because I didn’t have my driver’s license yet,” he recalled. As soon as he turned 18, Shahan applied for his license the very next day and continued to train rigorously. Despite narrowly missing out on a spot in the 2022 Trophy, he remained undeterred, training alongside his friends and mentors, Dev Venkatesh (202) and Anand Dharesan (201). His persistence paid off as he finally made it to the GS Trophy 2024, not just as a participant but as a member of Team India.\n\nFor Shahan, the GS Trophy is just the beginning. He plans to take on an instructor course and explore rallying professionally. “Maybe I’ll be the youngest marshal someday,” he said with a smile. It’s clear that for Shahan, this adventure is only the start of a long and promising journey.\n\nBehind the Scenes: The Making of the GS Trophy. Stefanie Grund, Senior Project Manager for the International GS Trophy 2024, shared insights into the complexity of organizing such a large-scale event. “You can prepare everything perfectly but have to be ready for any change,” she stated, reflecting on the unpredictable nature of the event planning.\n\nEach GS Trophy comes with unique challenges. “There’s always one topic which is especially difficult for the organization,” she mentioned, highlighting the helicopter logistics in Namibia as a major issue this year.\n\nStefanie also explained the extensive permitting process in Namibia: “We had to get a lot of permits like drone permits, track permits, and work visas for everyone involved.” Support from a local film production agency was crucial in navigating these challenges.\n\nBMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024, Namibia.

Situated in southwestern Africa, it is bordered by Angola and Zambia to the north, Botswana to the east, South Africa to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.\n\nThe country is known for its arid climate, being the driest in sub-Saharan Africa, and its vast, rugged terrains.\n\nGeography.Namibia spans an area of about 825,615 square kilometers, making it one of the largest countries in Africa. Its landscapes are dominated by deserts, including the ancient Namib Desert along the coast and the vast Kalahari Desert in the east. The central plateau, where the capital city Windhoek is located, rises to over 1,500 meters above sea level and is bordered by mountain ranges such as the Erongo Mountains. Namibia also has significant watercourses like the Okavango, Zambezi, and Kwando rivers, which carry water from high-rainfall areas in Angola across the Kalahari, supporting some of the most biodiverse areas in the country​.\n\nDemographics.Namibia is sparsely populated, with a population density of about 3.7 people per square kilometer. The population is approximately 2.8 million people as of 2023. It is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, with most people living in urban centers near major water sources. Windhoek, the capital, is the largest city, with a population of around 477,000​.\n\nHistory and Culture.Namibia has a rich cultural heritage influenced by various groups, including the Khoisan, Damara, and Nama people, as well as the Bantu-speaking Ovambo and Herero people who migrated into the area around the 14th century. The country was a German colony in the late 19th century and was later administered by South Africa until it gained independence in 1990. This colonial history has significantly impacted the country’s architecture, language, and cultural institutions.\n\nLandscape.The Namib Desert, which extends along the entire western coast of Namibia, is one of the oldest deserts in the world and features iconic landscapes such as the towering sand dunes of Sossusvlei. The Etosha Pan, a vast salt pan in the north, turns into a shallow lake during the rainy season and supports a diverse array of wildlife. In the south, the Fish River Canyon is one of the largest canyons in the world, showcasing spectacular geological formations​.\n\nNamibia’s unique blend of desert landscapes, towering mountains, and vibrant cultures make it a truly remarkable country, offering both the harsh beauty of its arid terrains and the resilience of its people.\n\nThe Spirit Behind the Ride: Heartwarming Tales from the GS Trophy.\n\nA Family Affair: Father and Son Make GS Trophy History.In a heartwarming display of the GS Spirit, Andrea Gioia (151) and his father, Massimo Gioia (152) of Team Italy, have become the first father and son duo to compete together in the GS Trophy. When asked about their feelings upon arrival, Massimo shared, “This is a very beautiful experience with my son, Andrea.” It's clear that this event is not just another competition for them; it's a shared adventure that has deepened their bond.\n\nFor Andrea, riding alongside his father is something special. “I always use a motorbike with my father, but I never did something like this with him before,” he said, emphasizing the uniqueness of participating in such a significant event together.\n\nTheir preparation for the GS Trophy was a true family affair. “We trained with the enduro motorbike and had some sessions with BMW Academy in Italy,” Massimo explained. Being just 40 kilometers apart back home allowed them to practice together often.\n\nRiding Through Pain: Anna’s Journey to the GS Trophy.Two months before the GS Trophy, Anna Cárdova (322) of the Female International Team was thrown off her horse, dislocating her shoulder in a painful accident that nearly derailed her dreams of competing.\n\n\"I had the joint out of the shoulder for almost two hours. It was really difficult to get it back, and it was really painful,\" she shared. Despite the pain, Anna’s resolve never wavered.\n\nFollowing the accident, she underwent five weeks of rehabilitation. “I found an amazing physiotherapist who gave me exercises to fix not just the joint but all the muscles and things around the shoulder.” Her dedication to recovery was unwavering, exercising four times a day. “It was necessary because I really wanted to be here,” she emphasized.\n\nWhen she finally saw her GS Trophy bike with her name on it, the struggle and pain seemed to fade. “The feeling is amazing. It’s something exceptional, the only one in the world, and it’s here at the GS Trophy,” she said, with a sense of accomplishment. Anna’s story is a powerful reminder that with resilience and determination, no challenge is insurmountable.\n\nAn Amputee’s Triumph: Conquering the GS Trophy Challenge. Mike Booth (160), MRP (Media Related Person) for Team UK, didn’t let his prosthetic leg hold him back from experiencing the thrill of the GS Trophy. “There’s two ways of looking at an injury,” he said. “You either use it as an excuse not to do things, or you use it as a reason to just try a bit harder.” With this mindset, he faced the same grueling routes as the competitors, covering the sandy tracks, rocky canyons, and long, demanding days.\n\nDespite losing his right leg in a severe crash at the Isle of Man TT two years ago, Mike chose to push his limits rather than be defined by them. “Some days were really hard. The sandy tracks were so churned up, I thought if this gets any harder, I might have to throw in the towel,” he shared, reflecting on the physical and mental challenge of keeping up with the intense pace.\n\nEven in those tough moments, Mike’s determination never wavered. “I’m never going to be as good as I was before because my leg isn’t going to grow back,” he said, “but if you keep trying to get better, stay healthy, and try to be as strong as you possibly can, then the only limiting factor is your mindset.”\n\nFor Mike, the GS Trophy was more than just a test of endurance; it was a testament to the human spirit’s capacity to overcome adversity. His journey serves as a powerful reminder to all: “Just get out there and do it if you can.”\n\nA New Generation Rises: A Young Competitor's Story.At just 21 years old, Sardar Shahan Khan (203) of Team India is the youngest participant in this year’s GS Trophy, embodying both youth and determination. “I’ve been off-roading for half of my life,” Shahan proudly shared. “I have three GSs at home, and half of their mileage is off-road.”\n\nThis was not his first attempt to qualify. Back in 2020, he competed in the qualifier of his home country, India, for the GS Trophy but couldn’t proceed due to not having a driver’s license. “I was 17 back then. I got the best time but couldn’t compete because I didn’t have my driver’s license yet,” he recalled. As soon as he turned 18, Shahan applied for his license the very next day and continued to train rigorously. Despite narrowly missing out on a spot in the 2022 Trophy, he remained undeterred, training alongside his friends and mentors, Dev Venkatesh (202) and Anand Dharesan (201). His persistence paid off as he finally made it to the GS Trophy 2024, not just as a participant but as a member of Team India.\n\nFor Shahan, the GS Trophy is just the beginning. He plans to take on an instructor course and explore rallying professionally. “Maybe I’ll be the youngest marshal someday,” he said with a smile. It’s clear that for Shahan, this adventure is only the start of a long and promising journey.\n\nBehind the Scenes: The Making of the GS Trophy.

Each day presented unique challenges designed to push the limits of both the riders and their machines. Participants faced a series of special stages that tested their off-road riding capabilities, mechanical knowledge, navigation skills, intelligence, and teamwork, all while demonstrating the rugged versatility of the BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike.\n\nWith nearly 190 participants—including riders, marshals, mechanics, medical teams, and media representatives - from 34 nations, the GS Trophy 2024 was a global celebration of adventure motorcycling. It brought together 120 motorcycles and 32 support vehicles, creating a vivid tableau of international unity and shared passion for exploration.\n\nReturning to Africa, where the GS Trophy first began in 2008, this year’s edition paid homage to the spirit of adventure that has defined the event since its inception. After traveling through the challenging terrains of Tunisia, Southern Africa, Patagonia, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia, New Zealand, and Albania in previous editions, the GS Trophy came full circle, embracing Namibia's rugged beauty.\n\nTeam Germany Reclaims the Trophy.The final day of the BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024 was charged with excitement as Team Germany stood on the brink of an extraordinary achievement. With South Africa having claimed the last four editions—in 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 - Germany was eager to carve their own place in the event’s storied history.\n\nHaving previously won the GS Trophy in 2012, Team Germany was no stranger to success. This year, they returned with renewed determination, ready to showcase their skill and teamwork on Namibia’s demanding and diverse terrain. From the challenging riverbed of the Khan River to the rugged ascents of Bosua Pass, the German team met every challenge with precision and resilience, distinguishing themselves through their consistent performance.\n\nReflecting on their victory, Christopher Michi (181) expressed the team’s disbelief and joy: “It’s an indescribable feeling. We came here to give our best, but actually to stand here as winners, it’s surreal.”\n\nThroughout the competition, their strategic approach and unwavering focus allowed them to steadily gain points, ultimately securing their lead. “We’ve trained for this moment for so long,” said Niko Wecker (182). “Every special stage, every obstacle, we faced it together as a team. South Africa has set the bar incredibly high for so many years, and to reach this milestone is just incredible.”\n\nWhen the final results were announced, the team’s excitement was undeniable. They had accomplished what they set out to do, reclaiming the GS Trophy title. “This victory is more than just a trophy,” Jan Stahl (183) reflected. “It’s the culmination of everything we’ve worked for. The feeling of standing here, knowing we’ve made it—it’s something we’ll never forget.”\n\nThe Rise of Team International: A New Milestone for the Female Riders.After six days of relentless competition through Namibia's challenging terrains, the Female International Team emerged victorious.\n\nFrom the outset, the team demonstrated a remarkable blend of skill, teamwork, and determination. Each special stage was met with enthusiasm and grit as they navigated through the dunes, rocky passes, and technical trails that defined this year's course. Their journey was not just about the competition; it was about the bond they shared and the passion they brought to every challenge.\n\n“I am beyond thrilled! This feels like a dream come true,” said Małgorzata Jakubiak (321), reflecting on their victory. “We knew the competition would be tough, but to stand here as winners is something I will cherish forever. We’ve pushed our limits and learned so much along the way.”\n\nThe team's strategy and cohesion were key to their success, allowing them to consistently perform at the highest level across the various special stages. Their victory was a testament to the strength of their preparation and the support they gave each other throughout the event. “I am over the moon!” said Anna Cárdova (322). “I never imagined we would come this far, and to be standing here as winners is just surreal. It’s an honor I never expected, and I’m so grateful to be a part of this incredible experience!”\n\nThis victory is not just a win for Team International; it is a celebration of the growing presence and impact of female riders in the world of adventure motorcycling.\n\nIn 2024, BMW Motorrad continues to champion female riders by maintaining dedicated competition categories for the women's teams, featuring six two-person teams tackling the same course and challenges as the men’s teams, competing for their own Trophy. And what an incredible display of skill and spirit it has been.\n\nFearless and remarkably prepared, these women have proven themselves in terms of both skills and endurance, and their mastery of the BMW R 1300 GS Trophy Competition Bike has been impressive. These competitors stand at the forefront of a growing movement of women embracing adventure motorcycling, and their stories reflect the vibrant evolution of the female GS scene.\n\nThe Adventure Unfolded: Day-by-Day Triumphs and Trials.\n\nDay 1: Midgard to Ai Aiba – A Warm Welcome.At day 1 the GS Trophy 2024 kicked off with an exhilarating ride from Midgard to Ai Aiba, introducing participants to the Namibian landscape’s diverse and challenging terrain.\n\nThe riders faced three special challenges: the Namibia Welcome Trial, a technical section near an abandoned copper mine; the AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge, a thrilling test through a sandy riverbed; and the Photo Challenge, where riders had to capture the spirit of the day in a single image.

MINI remains true to its claim: “Less is more”, focusing on what really matters. With this approach, MINI makes an important contribution to shaping the future in a more conscious and sustainable way. This commitment is particularly reflected in the current MINI generation, for example through the use of innovative and recycled materials in the interior.\n\nKnit partially made from Recyclate – Sustainability You Can Feel\n\nIn line with the \"Secondary First\" principle, MINI uses knit from recycled materials in all models starting with the market launch in 2024. The knitted material consists of 92% polyester recyclate and is used for dashboard upholstery, door trim, and center console lid. This significantly reduces CO2e emissions and water consumption in production compared to primary materials.\n\nDesign, Function, and Sustainability\n\nThe specially developed knitted look gives the interior of the MINI family a distinctive look and opens up new possibilities for individual colour and pattern worlds. It enables a two-colour design with an impressive depth effect. This effect occurs when the colour of the lower textile layer subtly shines through the upper layer. This structure, inspired by sneaker design and carefully further developed, gives the surfaces visual complexity and ensures a high-quality, unique look in the interior. The components are also abrasion-resistant, structurally reinforced, and completely leather-free.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 also relies on this innovative technology: In the \"Contemporary\" trim of the first model of the Neue Klasse, the knit of the instrument panel is made of 75% recycled material – a clear commitment to the principle of \"Design for Circularity\". While the light in the MINI family is projected onto the dashboard, the lighting in the BMW iX3 comes from the rear. For this, the knit pattern was deliberately designed to be more translucent so that the new backlighting comes into its own optimally.\n\nStronger Together: Collaboration is Key\n\nThe textile solution for the MINI interior was made ready for series production in close collaboration with internal and external partners: cross-industry and cross-departmental cooperation proves to be the key to innovations in sustainability. Close cooperation with partners generates new impulses and solutions that further advance sustainable materials and processes and enable the development of future-oriented products.\n\nThis innovative strength was recently honoured: MINI Knit is the overall winner of the SPE Automotive Award 2025 and winner of the Grand Award in the \"Body Interior\" category.

'We are proud that the M2 CS has once again set a new benchmark in the compact car class with this lap time.'\n\nThe continuation of a success story.\n\nThe previous best time for a BMW M2 model was set by Weidinger in April 2023, when he completed the course in 7:38.7 minutes. Two years later, he beat this time by 13 seconds, breaking the class record of 7:30 minutes for the first time. With the newly set best time of 7:25.5 minutes, the BMW M2 CS demonstrates its outstanding performance as well as the innovative power and engineering skills of BMW M GmbH.\n\nPrevious record runs on the Nordschleife by the BMW M4 CS, the BMW M4 CSL and the BMW M3 CS, all mid-range vehicles, achieved times under 7:30 minutes. The BMW M4 CSL also holds the best lap time ever recorded for a BMW Group production car. The official, notarised time is 7:18.137 minutes.\n\nThe \"Green Hell\" myth: The Nordschleife as a touchstone.\n\nOften referred to as the 'Green Hell', the Nordschleife racetrack is considered one of the most demanding and challenging racetracks in the world. Measuring 20.832 kilometres in length with over 70 bends, it places the highest demands on drivers and vehicles alike. A fast lap on this track proves a vehicle's performance and handling capabilities. The Nordschleife lap times are the gold standard for measuring a vehicle's sporting performance and driving dynamics. Record runs are monitored by a neutral testing organisation, and the vehicles are checked to ensure they are in standard condition. This detailed inspection ensures that the record runs are carried out using production vehicles.\n\nThe Nürburgring - Home of BMW M.\n\nBMW M and the Nürburgring have been in partnership for over a quarter of a century. From the BMW M Power Grandstand and BMW M Bridge to the BMW M Driving Experience and BMW M Test Centre, not to mention test drives on the Nordschleife for M vehicles en route to series production, the partnership between BMW M and the Nürburgring has been a resounding success for over 25 years. The Nordschleife serves as a test bench for every M model. The BMW M Test Centre is equipped with cutting-edge workshop facilities that allow BMW M to put vehicles through rigorous testing on the Nordschleife track even before they reach production, as well as to develop new models.\n\nBMW M Motorsport racing cars have achieved numerous successes in various racing series, including 21 overall victories in the Nürburgring 24-hour race. The M Power showroom, which was redesigned in 2021, is another flagship of the cooperation. The Nürburgring's position as the home of BMW M has been further strengthened since then.\n\nThe new BMW M2 CS: More power, improved driving dynamics and consistent lightweight construction.\n\nThe new BMW M2 CS is a testament to BMW M GmbH's ongoing commitment to setting the standard in the compact high-performance sports car segment. Its combination of performance, lightweight construction and innovative technology makes the BMW M2 CS a vehicle that gets drivers and enthusiasts' hearts racing. The BMW M2 CS increases driving pleasure in the premium segment with its enhanced performance and outstanding agility. The advanced six-cylinder in-line engine featuring BMW M TwinPower Turbo technology delivers an impressive output of 390 kW/530 hp and a maximum torque of 650 Nm. Model-specific engine mounts, an adaptive M suspension and an M compound brake system all contribute to its sporty performance. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels via an 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. The BMW M2 CS is the lightest model of the current M2 generation thanks to targeted lightweight construction, including a large number of exterior and interior components made of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP), which reduces its weight by around 30 kg. This makes a decisive contribution to its outstanding driving dynamics. The BMW M2 CS comes with forged M light-alloy wheels as standard. Manufactured at the BMW Group plant in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, the BMW M2 CS is a limited edition model with a market launch planned for late summer 2025, priced at 115,000 euros in Germany.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption and emission figures: (Fuel consumption combined: 10.0 l/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO2 class G) The data on fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, power consumption and range refer to vehicles on the automotive market in Germany.

'We are proud that the M2 CS has once again set a new benchmark in the compact car class with this lap time.'\n\nThe continuation of a success story.\n\nThe previous best time for a BMW M2 model was set by Weidinger in April 2023, when he completed the course in 7:38.7 minutes. Two years later, he beat this time by 13 seconds, breaking the class record of 7:30 minutes for the first time. With the newly set best time of 7:25.5 minutes, the BMW M2 CS demonstrates its outstanding performance as well as the innovative power and engineering skills of BMW M GmbH.\n\nPrevious record runs on the Nordschleife by the BMW M4 CS, the BMW M4 CSL and the BMW M3 CS, all mid-range vehicles, achieved times under 7:30 minutes. The BMW M4 CSL also holds the best lap time ever recorded for a BMW Group production car. The official, notarised time is 7:18.137 minutes.\n\nThe \"Green Hell\" myth: The Nordschleife as a touchstone.\n\nOften referred to as the 'Green Hell', the Nordschleife racetrack is considered one of the most demanding and challenging racetracks in the world. Measuring 20.832 kilometres in length with over 70 bends, it places the highest demands on drivers and vehicles alike. A fast lap on this track proves a vehicle's performance and handling capabilities. The Nordschleife lap times are the gold standard for measuring a vehicle's sporting performance and driving dynamics. Record runs are monitored by a neutral testing organisation, and the vehicles are checked to ensure they are in standard condition. This detailed inspection ensures that the record runs are carried out using production vehicles.\n\nThe Nürburgring - Home of BMW M.\n\nBMW M and the Nürburgring have been in partnership for over a quarter of a century. From the BMW M Power Grandstand and BMW M Bridge to the BMW M Driving Experience and BMW M Test Centre, not to mention test drives on the Nordschleife for M vehicles en route to series production, the partnership between BMW M and the Nürburgring has been a resounding success for over 25 years. The Nordschleife serves as a test bench for every M model. The BMW M Test Centre is equipped with cutting-edge workshop facilities that allow BMW M to put vehicles through rigorous testing on the Nordschleife track even before they reach production, as well as to develop new models.\n\nBMW M Motorsport racing cars have achieved numerous successes in various racing series, including 21 overall victories in the Nürburgring 24-hour race. The M Power showroom, which was redesigned in 2021, is another flagship of the cooperation. The Nürburgring's position as the home of BMW M has been further strengthened since then.\n\nThe new BMW M2 CS: More power, improved driving dynamics and consistent lightweight construction.\n\nThe new BMW M2 CS is a testament to BMW M GmbH's ongoing commitment to setting the standard in the compact high-performance sports car segment. Its combination of performance, lightweight construction and innovative technology makes the BMW M2 CS a vehicle that gets drivers and enthusiasts' hearts racing. The BMW M2 CS increases driving pleasure in the premium segment with its enhanced performance and outstanding agility. The advanced six-cylinder in-line engine featuring BMW M TwinPower Turbo technology delivers an impressive output of 390 kW/530 hp and a maximum torque of 650 Nm. Model-specific engine mounts, an adaptive M suspension and an M compound brake system all contribute to its sporty performance. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels via an 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic.

The African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC) is set to arrive in Marrakech following the successful completion of its first workshops with African filmmakers and visual artists in Lagos, Tangier, and Nairobi. Continuing her BMW Art Car project, the AFMAC initiative was launched in April this year by internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu, in collaboration with Emmy-nominated film producer Mehret Mandefro and BMW. As the long-term mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival (28 November – 6 December), Smeia, the exclusive importer of BMW in Morocco, together with BMW AG, will offer insights into works from AFMAC lead artists Zeresenay Berhane Mehari, Wanuri Kahiu, Jim Chuchu and The Otolith Group, as well as impressions from the workshops next to Mehretu’s BMW Art Car on the festival grounds during the opening weekend.\n\n10 years of partnership between Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, and Marrakech International Film Festival Established in 2001, the Marrakech International Film Festival aims to support and promote both the art of cinema and the film industry in Morocco. Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, has been the mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival for the past ten years enhancing each guest’s journey with elegance and distinction. Over the last two decades, the festival has evolved into a vibrant platform for creativity and exploration, celebrating the values of diversity, cultural exchange, and mutual enrichment.\n\nFor its 22nd edition the Marrakech International Film Festival celebrates world cinema with a selection of 82 films from 31 countries, presented in several sections: the Official Competition, Gala Screenings, Horizons section, the 11th Continent, Moroccan Panorama, Young Audiences and Families, and films screened in parallel with Tributes given to film personalities. The Official Competition showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature films that compete for the Étoile d’or, awarded by a jury headed this year by South Korean director and multiple award winner Bong Joon-ho. Additionally, the festival will honour Jodie Foster, Guillermo del Toro, Raouya, and Hussein Fahmi – four exceptional figures whose careers showcase the diversity and richness of cinema. Highlights of this year's festival programme include screenings of film productions such as Dead Man’s Wire (opening film/ Gala) by Gus Van Sant and Akinola Davies Jr.'s My Father's Shadow (Official Competition). All details on this year’s official selection can be found here.\n\nSmeia, BMW and AFMAC are also collaborating with the festival’s Atlas Workshops, an industry and talent development programme. As part of this partnership, Mehret Mandefro and Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will share insights into their work with the Atlas Station participants on 30 November at 12noon. The panel “Beyond the Gaze: Authentic African Stories and the Creative Journey” explores the promise and perils of authentic storytelling as part of the creative process building AFMAC. Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will talk about his creative process and explore how to protect voice and vision in a global marketplace that often requires compromise.\n\nAFMAC at Marrakech International Film FestivalAt this year’s festival edition, Julie Mehretu's BMW Art Car #20 will be showcased on the festival grounds, surrounded by an AFMAC Hub. Julie Mehretu unveiled her BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car at the Centre Pompidou in 2024, marking the first time in the collection's history that an artist developed an Art Car that goes far beyond the car as a pure art object. In collaboration with BMW and Mehret Mandefro, Mehretu launched the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), which has been hosting workshops in 2025 and 2026 across African cities such as Dakar, Lagos, and Cape Town. The initiative aims to nurture creativity and foster collaboration with emerging African artists and filmmakers.\n\n“The magic of bringing people together starts with us. AFMAC creates forums for conversations in small, critical masses and surfaces resources to take the next steps. We build on the work of our local cultural partners: They already created a grounded cultural infrastructure, showing that art is not just a nice-to-have but a must-have. The talent and cultural energy emerging from these cities is electric – culture cannot be gated, it will always find a way to be heard,“ says Mehret Mandefro, co-founder of AFMAC.\n\nThe outcomes of the AFMAC workshops will be exhibited alongside the 20th BMW Art Car at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town at the end of 2026. The presentation at the Marrakech International Film Festival offers a unique opportunity to gain first insights into the ongoing project ahead of the final exhibition. The display of Mehretu’s BMW M Hybrid V8 in Marrakech is part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary BMW Art Car Collection this year. To mark this jubilee, the tour features an exhibition programme spanning all five continents and including numerous accompanying events.\n\nThe AFMAC hub on the festival grounds in Marrakech is open to all visitors and located some meters away from the epicentre of the Film Festival Masterclasses, the Meydene theatre at M Avenue Marrakech. It offers an exclusive opportunity to explore selected works by leading artists, Wanuri Kahiu , The Otolith Group, and Zeresenay Berhane Mehari :\n\nJim Chuchu “Invocations: Release” (2015), a single-channel video work, portrays an African body navigating tradition, expectation, and self-determination, using ritualistic movement and visual metaphors to transform constraint into liberation.\n\n“Carrying Capacities” (2025) is a rhythmic visual meditation using aerial perspectives and editing to explore Earth's landscapes, cities, human activity, and environmental alteration, reflecting on the planet's ability to sustain human impact.\n\nWanuri Kahiu Through the trailer to the Sci-Fi short film “Pumzi” (2009) visitors encounter a futuristic Africa, 35 years after World War III ‘The Water War’. In a world where nature is extinct and the outside is dead, museum curator Asha defies the Maitu Council's restrictions to plant a germinating seedling outside, hoping to uncover signs of life.\n\nThe Otolith Group Inspired by the poet Rabindranath Tagore's 1921 lecture “The Message of the Forest” at Berlin's Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität—recorded on shellac at the Hotel Esplanade—the Otolith Group's eponymous work bridges nearly a century of time. The digitized recording of Tagore's voice, which envisioned the world campus he would establish that same year at Visva Bharati University in West Bengal, now speaks to ancient Banyan trees and today's students. Through separate paths of image and sound, the work connects the ancient past to the distant future of a changing planet.\n\nZeresenay Berhane MehariThrough the trailer to the feature film “Difret” visitors encounter the story of a young Ethiopian girl and a lawyer who challenge deeply-rooted cultural traditions to fight for equal rights. When 14-year-old Hirut is abducted for marriage and kills her captor in self-defense, lawyer Meaza steps in to save her from a death sentence, risking everything to confront one of Ethiopia’s oldest traditions.\n\nAfrican Film and Media Arts Collective – Past and future stationsApril 2025: Lagos, Nigeria, in partnership with Angels & MuseLead artist: Coco Fusco\n\nJuly 2025: Tangier, Morocco, in partnership with Cinematheque de TangerLead artist: Zeresenay Berhane Mehari\n\nOctober 2025: Nairobi, Kenya, in partnership with DocuboxLead artists: Jim Chuchu and Wanuri Kahiu\n\nDecember 2025: Dakar, Senegal, in partnership with Fanta Sy and Raw Material CompanyLead artist: Mati Diop\n\nJanuary 2026: Cape Town, South Africa, in partnership with Chimurenga Lead artist: The Otolith Group\n\n10 December 2026 – 15 August 2027: Final exhibition at Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art (Zeitz MOCAA), Cape Town, South Africa\n\nBiographies of the founders and lead artists Julie Mehretu is a world-renowned American artist, born in Addis Ababa in 1970.

The African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC) is set to arrive in Marrakech following the successful completion of its first workshops with African filmmakers and visual artists in Lagos, Tangier, and Nairobi. Continuing her BMW Art Car project, the AFMAC initiative was launched in April this year by internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu, in collaboration with Emmy-nominated film producer Mehret Mandefro and BMW. As the long-term mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival (28 November – 6 December), Smeia, the exclusive importer of BMW in Morocco, together with BMW AG, will offer insights into works from AFMAC lead artists Zeresenay Berhane Mehari, Wanuri Kahiu, Jim Chuchu and The Otolith Group, as well as impressions from the workshops next to Mehretu’s BMW Art Car on the festival grounds during the opening weekend.\n\n10 years of partnership between Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, and Marrakech International Film Festival Established in 2001, the Marrakech International Film Festival aims to support and promote both the art of cinema and the film industry in Morocco. Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, has been the mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival for the past ten years enhancing each guest’s journey with elegance and distinction. Over the last two decades, the festival has evolved into a vibrant platform for creativity and exploration, celebrating the values of diversity, cultural exchange, and mutual enrichment.\n\nFor its 22nd edition the Marrakech International Film Festival celebrates world cinema with a selection of 82 films from 31 countries, presented in several sections: the Official Competition, Gala Screenings, Horizons section, the 11th Continent, Moroccan Panorama, Young Audiences and Families, and films screened in parallel with Tributes given to film personalities. The Official Competition showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature films that compete for the Étoile d’or, awarded by a jury headed this year by South Korean director and multiple award winner Bong Joon-ho. Additionally, the festival will honour Jodie Foster, Guillermo del Toro, Raouya, and Hussein Fahmi – four exceptional figures whose careers showcase the diversity and richness of cinema.

All details on this year’s official selection can be found here.\n\nSmeia, BMW and AFMAC are also collaborating with the festival’s Atlas Workshops, an industry and talent development programme. As part of this partnership, Mehret Mandefro and Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will share insights into their work with the Atlas Station participants on 30 November at 12noon. The panel “Beyond the Gaze: Authentic African Stories and the Creative Journey” explores the promise and perils of authentic storytelling as part of the creative process building AFMAC.

Julie Mehretu unveiled her BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car at the Centre Pompidou in 2024, marking the first time in the collection's history that an artist developed an Art Car that goes far beyond the car as a pure art object. In collaboration with BMW and Mehret Mandefro, Mehretu launched the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), which has been hosting workshops in 2025 and 2026 across African cities such as Dakar, Lagos, and Cape Town. The initiative aims to nurture creativity and foster collaboration with emerging African artists and filmmakers.\n\n“The magic of bringing people together starts with us. AFMAC creates forums for conversations in small, critical masses and surfaces resources to take the next steps. We build on the work of our local cultural partners: They already created a grounded cultural infrastructure, showing that art is not just a nice-to-have but a must-have. The talent and cultural energy emerging from these cities is electric – culture cannot be gated, it will always find a way to be heard,“ says Mehret Mandefro, co-founder of AFMAC.\n\nThe outcomes of the AFMAC workshops will be exhibited alongside the 20th BMW Art Car at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town at the end of 2026.

The digitized recording of Tagore's voice, which envisioned the world campus he would establish that same year at Visva Bharati University in West Bengal, now speaks to ancient Banyan trees and today's students.

After an intensive year, the “Class of 2025” has completed the BMW M Racing Academy - BMW M Motorsport’s dedicated support program for talented young drivers from customer racing. Under the close guidance of a team led by three BMW M works drivers, Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP), Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER) have received comprehensive training and support from BMW M Motorsport over the past months. Following the successful launch of the program, anticipation is already high for the “Class of 2026.”\n\nTo conclude their BMW M Racing Academy year, the four members of the “Class of 2025” spent a full week immersed in the world of BMW M Motorsport. At BMW’s headquarters in Munich (GER), Besler, Martí, Million, and Tröger enjoyed a guided tour of BMW Welt and the BMW Museum. They then participated in workshops on social media and brand building – and immediately put their new skills to the test: the group documented their joint road trip to Viareggio (ITA) in a BMW M5 for BMW M Motorsport’s official Instagram channel.\n\nIn Viareggio, the quartet once again trained with Formula Medicine – as they had at the beginning of the year – focusing on both their mental and physical performance. Under the professional supervision of Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his globally renowned team, the participants assessed their progress since the program’s start and evaluated their development. The “Class of 2025” also completed a 24-hour race simulation together, gaining firsthand experience of the procedures, challenges, and demands of endurance racing.\n\nThroughout the year, the four drivers accumulated many valuable test kilometers on real racetracks. In Miramas (FRA) and Varano (ITA), they worked side by side with BMW M works drivers on development testing for the new BMW M2 Racing. Martí and Besler also gained insights into BMW M Motorsport’s factory programs by attending the FIA WEC weekend in Imola (ITA), where they met Head of BMW M Motorsport, Andreas Roos and several works drivers. Meanwhile, Million joined BMW M Motorsport at the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship round in Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nThe participants were mentored throughout the year by a trio of BMW M works drivers. Jens Klingmann (GER) served as the main point of contact for the “Class of 2025,” supported by Max Hesse (GER) and Robby Foley (USA). The team was completed by Dirk Adorf (GER), who brought his extensive experience from previous talent development programs. Together, they provided expert guidance both on and off the track, offering invaluable advice, analysis, and feedback. Their presence at the participants’ GT4 customer racing events provided an especially valuable learning opportunity through direct, hands-on coaching.\n\nBesler, Martí, Tröger, and Million had earned their places in the Academy after a demanding selection process against a strong field of GT4 drivers last year. The selection for the second generation is already underway – and following the program’s successful debut, everyone involved is eagerly looking forward to the “Class of 2026.”\n\nStatements on the BMW M Racing Academy.\n\nBjörn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: “I’m extremely proud that we were able to establish this development program again this year. Supporting talent from the customer racing sector is something both BMW M Motorsport and I personally care deeply about. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, the four participants made important contributions to development work, benefitting everyone involved. It was fascinating to watch how our ‘Class of 2025’ evolved both on and off the track. My thanks go to our BMW M works drivers Jens, Max, and Robby for their intense and constructive mentoring, which makes this program so special. We’re all very eager to continue following the progress of Berkay, Nerea, Matt, and Niels. After such a strong debut year, I’m very excited to see what the next generation of the BMW M Racing Academy will bring in 2026.”\n\nJens Klingmann, BMW M works driver: “It was great that, in the second half of the year, we were able to dive deep into the DNA of BMW – the values, the core business, the history, and the future – to broaden the participants’ understanding as drivers and give them a bigger-picture view. At the start of the program, we worked with Formula Medicine to assess each participant’s physical and mental baseline, and from there we built personalized training plans. Seeing their progress over the year was very rewarding. The 24-hour simulation was also crucial for teaching how to approach such an event, manage rest periods, and recover both mentally and physically. For drivers without prior endurance experience, that’s a real eye-opener. Overall, my impression is extremely positive. It was a lot of fun, and we were able to give the participants behind-the-scenes insights that money can’t buy. I’m happy that we could always be there for them – whether analyzing onboard footage, answering questions, or sharing advice. I wish all four of them the very best and hope they can apply everything they’ve learned in the BMW M Racing Academy to their future careers, both on and off the track.”\n\nBerkay Besler, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “Racing for a brand like BMW is already something very special to me, but being part of the BMW family through the Academy made it even more meaningful. Having such close contact with all members of this big organization was incredibly valuable. The relationship with the three mentors was essential – especially since I’ve known Max for a long time and could exchange ideas with him throughout the year. I also spent a lot of time with Jens during the BMW M2 Racing tests, and his influence on my performance has been huge. After every test, we wrote reports to share with him, and after every race, I did race reports with my engineer – something I had never done before. It really helps us improve and analyze our weaknesses. I’ve also adapted my nutrition and training routines based on what I learned at Formula Medicine and use mental techniques during races to enhance my focus. All these experiences will be crucial for my future racing career.”\n\nNerea Martí, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy provided me with a complete preparation both on and off the track. I’m very grateful for the close connection to BMW and the opportunity to learn from everyone involved. I’ve learned to pay attention to small details and to plan my development strategically – from physical and mental preparation to communication and social media presence. The program has taught me how to prepare properly off the track, apply the right training methods, and balance physical and mental aspects to deliver my best performance. The chance to interact with our mentors and everyone involved in the program was incredibly valuable. Their experience, advice, and feedback had a big impact on my growth as a driver, and I’m confident that their guidance will continue to help me in the future.”\n\nMatt Million, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “My key takeaways fall into three categories: professionalism, performance, and in-depth knowledge of BMW M and BMW M Motorsport. The mentors in particular gave me a clear understanding of how to act as a BMW M driver and brand ambassador, both on and off the track. The conversations with Robby Foley and Max Hesse helped me build a framework for planning my next career steps. Overall, the program elevated me in every aspect as a driver and ambassador – from physical and mental training to recovery and team feedback. I’ve also started using media and interview opportunities much more effectively to represent myself and the brand. Sharing my story from the BMW M Racing Academy and my journey feels special. Representing the brand I raced with for years in club racing is personally a magical story for me.”\n\nNiels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy has given me insights into professional motorsport that you wouldn’t normally get. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, I gained my first experience in race car development, and working directly with the engineers was unique and highly educational. With the help of our mentors, especially Jens, I’ve learned how to give precise feedback to my race engineer. Thanks to our Formula Medicine training, I now prepare for races in a completely different way and can perform much better. All these important experiences have helped me develop further as a driver. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy has made me a more complete racer.”\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Sedan: energy consumption weighted combined: 17,6–17,2 kWh/100 km and 5–4,8 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 114–108 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B.

Martí and Besler also gained insights into BMW M Motorsport’s factory programs by attending the FIA WEC weekend in Imola (ITA), where they met Head of BMW M Motorsport, Andreas Roos and several works drivers. Meanwhile, Million joined BMW M Motorsport at the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship round in Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nThe participants were mentored throughout the year by a trio of BMW M works drivers. Jens Klingmann (GER) served as the main point of contact for the “Class of 2025,” supported by Max Hesse (GER) and Robby Foley (USA). The team was completed by Dirk Adorf (GER), who brought his extensive experience from previous talent development programs. Together, they provided expert guidance both on and off the track, offering invaluable advice, analysis, and feedback. Their presence at the participants’ GT4 customer racing events provided an especially valuable learning opportunity through direct, hands-on coaching.\n\nBesler, Martí, Tröger, and Million had earned their places in the Academy after a demanding selection process against a strong field of GT4 drivers last year. The selection for the second generation is already underway – and following the program’s successful debut, everyone involved is eagerly looking forward to the “Class of 2026.”\n\nStatements on the BMW M Racing Academy.\n\nBjörn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: “I’m extremely proud that we were able to establish this development program again this year. Supporting talent from the customer racing sector is something both BMW M Motorsport and I personally care deeply about. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, the four participants made important contributions to development work, benefitting everyone involved. It was fascinating to watch how our ‘Class of 2025’ evolved both on and off the track. My thanks go to our BMW M works drivers Jens, Max, and Robby for their intense and constructive mentoring, which makes this program so special. We’re all very eager to continue following the progress of Berkay, Nerea, Matt, and Niels. After such a strong debut year, I’m very excited to see what the next generation of the BMW M Racing Academy will bring in 2026.”\n\nJens Klingmann, BMW M works driver: “It was great that, in the second half of the year, we were able to dive deep into the DNA of BMW – the values, the core business, the history, and the future – to broaden the participants’ understanding as drivers and give them a bigger-picture view. At the start of the program, we worked with Formula Medicine to assess each participant’s physical and mental baseline, and from there we built personalized training plans. Seeing their progress over the year was very rewarding. The 24-hour simulation was also crucial for teaching how to approach such an event, manage rest periods, and recover both mentally and physically. For drivers without prior endurance experience, that’s a real eye-opener. Overall, my impression is extremely positive. It was a lot of fun, and we were able to give the participants behind-the-scenes insights that money can’t buy. I’m happy that we could always be there for them – whether analyzing onboard footage, answering questions, or sharing advice. I wish all four of them the very best and hope they can apply everything they’ve learned in the BMW M Racing Academy to their future careers, both on and off the track.”\n\nBerkay Besler, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “Racing for a brand like BMW is already something very special to me, but being part of the BMW family through the Academy made it even more meaningful. Having such close contact with all members of this big organization was incredibly valuable. The relationship with the three mentors was essential – especially since I’ve known Max for a long time and could exchange ideas with him throughout the year. I also spent a lot of time with Jens during the BMW M2 Racing tests, and his influence on my performance has been huge. After every test, we wrote reports to share with him, and after every race, I did race reports with my engineer – something I had never done before. It really helps us improve and analyze our weaknesses. I’ve also adapted my nutrition and training routines based on what I learned at Formula Medicine and use mental techniques during races to enhance my focus. All these experiences will be crucial for my future racing career.”\n\nNerea Martí, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy provided me with a complete preparation both on and off the track. I’m very grateful for the close connection to BMW and the opportunity to learn from everyone involved. I’ve learned to pay attention to small details and to plan my development strategically – from physical and mental preparation to communication and social media presence. The program has taught me how to prepare properly off the track, apply the right training methods, and balance physical and mental aspects to deliver my best performance. The chance to interact with our mentors and everyone involved in the program was incredibly valuable. Their experience, advice, and feedback had a big impact on my growth as a driver, and I’m confident that their guidance will continue to help me in the future.”\n\nMatt Million, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “My key takeaways fall into three categories: professionalism, performance, and in-depth knowledge of BMW M and BMW M Motorsport. The mentors in particular gave me a clear understanding of how to act as a BMW M driver and brand ambassador, both on and off the track. The conversations with Robby Foley and Max Hesse helped me build a framework for planning my next career steps. Overall, the program elevated me in every aspect as a driver and ambassador – from physical and mental training to recovery and team feedback. I’ve also started using media and interview opportunities much more effectively to represent myself and the brand. Sharing my story from the BMW M Racing Academy and my journey feels special. Representing the brand I raced with for years in club racing is personally a magical story for me.”\n\nNiels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy has given me insights into professional motorsport that you wouldn’t normally get. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, I gained my first experience in race car development, and working directly with the engineers was unique and highly educational. With the help of our mentors, especially Jens, I’ve learned how to give precise feedback to my race engineer. Thanks to our Formula Medicine training, I now prepare for races in a completely different way and can perform much better. All these important experiences have helped me develop further as a driver. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy has made me a more complete racer.”\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Sedan: energy consumption weighted combined: 17,6–17,2 kWh/100 km and 5–4,8 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 114–108 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B.

On 26th/27th April, the DTM kicks off its new season at Oschersleben (GER). In preparation for the first two races, the official DTM test day took place at the same location this week. Schubert Motorsport gathered valuable experience with its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs and BMW M factory drivers René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER). At the end of the two sessions on Wednesday, more than 250 test laps were recorded.\n\nThe focus of the tests for the team and both drivers was to familiarise themselves as much as possible with the EVO version of the BMW M4 GT3 in combination with the new Pirelli tyres that are used in the DTM. Rast completed 129 laps in the #33 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, which featured a new design from BMW M Motorsport partner RoboMarkets, and recorded a personal best time of 1:23.394 minutes. Wittmann completed 132 laps in his “Green Machine”, the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in Schaeffler colours, achieving a best time of 1:23.091 minutes. Schubert Motorsport enters the DTM season as the defending champion in the team standings and traditionally plays its home game at the Motorsport Arena Oschersleben.\n\nBMW M Motorsport and Endless are expanding their partnership.\n\nThe development of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO included a focus on optimising the brakes, with valuable assistance from brake specialist Endless, who has been collaborating with BMW M Motorsport since 2020. The partnership, previously limited to individual racing series such as the DTM and the Intercontinental GT Challenge, is now extended to the entire GT3 main programme. Endless will, among other things, appear for the first time as a partner of BMW M Motorsport in the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The test day was crucial for Schubert Motorsport and the drivers to gain experience with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The focus was on completing as many laps as possible and working through the extensive test programme. The Pirelli tyres are new to everyone, and it's particularly important to test how they perform on a long run. We will only find out where we stand in terms of lap times compared to the competition during the race weekend. Generally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, we aim to achieve victories and titles in the biggest GT racing series and at the most important single events worldwide. Endless, as a brake specialist with outstanding expertise, assists us in this endeavour. Together, we have worked on optimising our GT3 car, and we have already celebrated our first successes. I am very pleased that we were able to further expand our partnership with a view to the coming years and join forces worldwide.”\n\nLucas Nylund (CEO Endless Brake Technology Europe): “Since we started to collaborate with BMW M Motorsport in 2020, we have always felt very welcome within the BMW M Motorsport family as the supplier of high-quality racing brake technology, and we are happy to match the high expectations of BMW M Motorsport on all parts of their GT3 cars. To extend our partnership with BMW M Motorsport is a fantastic opportunity which we are very proud of, and we are looking forward to continuing our shared success story and to work even closer together with BMW M Motorsport by supporting their global GT3 programme. We would like to thank Andreas Roos, the drivers, the engineers, and the entire staff at BMW M Motorsport for their trust in Endless and for the further expanded partnership for the coming years. We will do our very best to achieve even more victories and to further continue our long-lasting success story.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “The anticipation for the DTM season is high, and the official test drives are always a great start to the intensive phase. We completed a full test programme, and I was able to spend a lot of time in the car. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt good. Compared to its predecessor, it offers a larger operating window, which will hopefully help us to better adapt the car to the specific challenges that the DTM presents than last year. We are currently experimenting in this area so that we can benefit from it from the first race weekend onwards.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I drove the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time and used the test day to get accustomed to the car. Even though there are few external changes, there are quite a few new features under the hood. Lap times have not yet played a role for us.

In preparation for the first two races, the official DTM test day took place at the same location this week. Schubert Motorsport gathered valuable experience with its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs and BMW M factory drivers René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER). At the end of the two sessions on Wednesday, more than 250 test laps were recorded.\n\nThe focus of the tests for the team and both drivers was to familiarise themselves as much as possible with the EVO version of the BMW M4 GT3 in combination with the new Pirelli tyres that are used in the DTM. Rast completed 129 laps in the #33 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, which featured a new design from BMW M Motorsport partner RoboMarkets, and recorded a personal best time of 1:23.394 minutes. Wittmann completed 132 laps in his “Green Machine”, the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in Schaeffler colours, achieving a best time of 1:23.091 minutes. Schubert Motorsport enters the DTM season as the defending champion in the team standings and traditionally plays its home game at the Motorsport Arena Oschersleben.\n\nBMW M Motorsport and Endless are expanding their partnership.\n\nThe development of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO included a focus on optimising the brakes, with valuable assistance from brake specialist Endless, who has been collaborating with BMW M Motorsport since 2020. The partnership, previously limited to individual racing series such as the DTM and the Intercontinental GT Challenge, is now extended to the entire GT3 main programme. Endless will, among other things, appear for the first time as a partner of BMW M Motorsport in the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The test day was crucial for Schubert Motorsport and the drivers to gain experience with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The focus was on completing as many laps as possible and working through the extensive test programme. The Pirelli tyres are new to everyone, and it's particularly important to test how they perform on a long run. We will only find out where we stand in terms of lap times compared to the competition during the race weekend. Generally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, we aim to achieve victories and titles in the biggest GT racing series and at the most important single events worldwide. Endless, as a brake specialist with outstanding expertise, assists us in this endeavour. Together, we have worked on optimising our GT3 car, and we have already celebrated our first successes. I am very pleased that we were able to further expand our partnership with a view to the coming years and join forces worldwide.”\n\nLucas Nylund (CEO Endless Brake Technology Europe): “Since we started to collaborate with BMW M Motorsport in 2020, we have always felt very welcome within the BMW M Motorsport family as the supplier of high-quality racing brake technology, and we are happy to match the high expectations of BMW M Motorsport on all parts of their GT3 cars. To extend our partnership with BMW M Motorsport is a fantastic opportunity which we are very proud of, and we are looking forward to continuing our shared success story and to work even closer together with BMW M Motorsport by supporting their global GT3 programme. We would like to thank Andreas Roos, the drivers, the engineers, and the entire staff at BMW M Motorsport for their trust in Endless and for the further expanded partnership for the coming years. We will do our very best to achieve even more victories and to further continue our long-lasting success story.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “The anticipation for the DTM season is high, and the official test drives are always a great start to the intensive phase. We completed a full test programme, and I was able to spend a lot of time in the car. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt good. Compared to its predecessor, it offers a larger operating window, which will hopefully help us to better adapt the car to the specific challenges that the DTM presents than last year. We are currently experimenting in this area so that we can benefit from it from the first race weekend onwards.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I drove the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time and used the test day to get accustomed to the car. Even though there are few external changes, there are quite a few new features under the hood. Lap times have not yet played a role for us. That will be the focus in a few weeks when we compete in our first races at Oschersleben. I am hoping for good results and am very excited to participate in this high-class DTM field.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}
