BMW and MINI will be hosting attention-grabbing stands at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Taking to the stage in Tokyo on 31 October – 9 November will be a host of future-focused BMW and MINI models and technologies, including the first new Neue Klasse model BMW iX3, hydrogen fuel cell technology, the MINI family including new MINI Paul Smith Edition, the special-edition BMW M2 CS* and the BMW Concept Speedtop concept car. BMW Motorrad will also be represented at the event – in the form of the fully electric BMW CE 02 and the BMW M 1000 RR ridden by Toprak Razgatlıoğlu to his second successive FIM Superbike World Championship crown in 2025. On 29 and 30 October, representatives of the international media will have an early opportunity to take in the compelling exhibits from the three brands at the 1,100-square-metre stand in Tokyo’s Big Sight exhibition centre. Visitors to the show can also experience in-car gaming with AirConsole, which is making its debut with BMW Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will be among the vehicles offering customers this function, which brings with it world-renowned titles such as UNO® Car Party!, Hot Wheels: Xtreme OverdriveTM and PAC-MANTM Championship Edition.\n\nAsian premiere for the new BMW iX3, the first new Neue Klasse model.\n\nThe Japan Mobility Show will host the Asian premiere of the first new Neue Klasse model: the BMW iX3. Lining up alongside the iX3 will be revolutionary technologies that point the way to the future of the BMW Group as a whole. Visitors to the Japan Mobility Show will see the new BMW iX3 reveal technological leaps forward in a host of different areas: electric mobility, display and control/operation concept, digitalisation, connectivity, design and sustainability. All future BMW models will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue Klasse – regardless of the type of drive system they use.\n\nProduction of the BMW iX3 for Japan is scheduled to begin in March 2026, with sales through the Japanese BMW dealer network currently due to begin in the second half of 2026. The BMW iX3 launches an all-new design language for the BMW brand that faithfully conveys the technological advances achieved. The revolutionary display and control/operation concept BMW Panoramic iDrive with the new BMW Panoramic Vision and new BMW Operating System X redefines the user experience and creates flawless driver orientation in the BMW mould. The zonal electronics architecture featuring four high-performance computers – the “superbrains” – provides the basis for the software-defined vehicle. One of these high-performance computers is the Heart of Joy: with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed fully in-house, it can manage the driving characteristics of the overall vehicle from a standstill to the dynamic limit. As the first new Neue Klasse model – with sixth-generation (Gen6) BMW eDrive, cylindrical-cell battery and new electric motors – the new BMW iX3 embodies major technological progress. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables 372 km (231 miles) of range to be added in ten minutes, and bidirectional charging functions turn the car into a powerbank on wheels.\n\nThe new BMW iX5 Hydrogen* from 2028.\n\nProduct diversity continues to be a key success factor for the BMW Group. A wide-ranging portfolio of drive systems – encompassing internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive systems and, starting with the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen in 2028, hydrogen fuel cell technology – lays the foundations for successfully meeting the varying demands and needs of customers worldwide both now and in the future.\n\nThe hydrogen drive technology is based on the third-generation fuel cell system that the BMW Group is developing in collaboration with the Toyota Motor Corporation. This technological advance paves the way for a system with a more compact design that is also more powerful and efficient, thereby increasing range and output at the same time as reducing energy consumption. Competence centres in Munich and at BMW Group Plant Steyr are building initial prototypes for this technology. And BMW Group Plant Landshut is supplying additional components for the drive system.\n\nWorld premiere for the MINI Paul Smith Edition.\n\nBack in 1998, Paul Smith lent his signature to a limited-run edition of the classic Mini. And MINI and the British designer have since linked up to bring a number of other projects to fruition. Fast forward to the present day and the Japan Mobility Show 2025 will provide the setting for the latest milestone in this tradition-steeped collaboration: the world premiere of the new MINI Paul Smith Edition. For this special-edition car, Paul Smith brings his world-renowned “classic with a twist” design language to the MINI Cooper family. The styling and details of the cars bring together the unmistakable style of Paul Smith with the playful, upbeat and independent spirit of the MINI brand.\n\nExclusive exterior colours such as Nottingham Green and sophisticated design elements like the Paul Smith “signature stripe” accentuate the distinctive looks of the MINI Paul Smith Edition. Standard specification for the MINI Paul Smith Edition includes 18-inch Night Flash Spoke black alloy wheels with accents in Dark Steel. And a Paul Smith signature on the wheel trims and black horizontal boot lid handle marks out the special-edition cars. The MINI Paul Smith Edition will be offered for the MINI Cooper 3-Door, 5-Door and MINI Cooper Convertible models. Worldwide sales of the fully electric variants of the MINI Paul Smith Edition will get underway with the world premiere at the Japan Mobility Show, while orders for variants with an internal combustion engine will open in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nJapan premiere for the special-edition BMW M2 CS.\n\nThe special-edition BMW M2 CS is celebrating its Japanese premiere at the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Its high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinTurbo technology – an upgraded version of the unit found in the standard M2 – develops an impressive 390 kW/530 hp at 6,250 rpm. In so doing, the compact high-performance sports car from BMW M GmbH raises the bar for undiluted driving pleasure a notch higher still.\n\nThe standard-fitted eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic sends the engine’s power to the rear wheels of the BMW M2 CS. Judicious application of lightweight design techniques including the use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) reduces the weight of the special edition by around 30 kilograms compared to the standard M2. Thanks to the car’s lighter weight and lightning-fast power delivery, the BMW M2 CS is able to break the four-second barrier for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) with a time of 3.8 seconds. The figure calculated using the “1-foot rollout” method** is 3.5 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 3.4 seconds and top speed is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph). The chassis technology and braking system of the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the uprated performance characteristics of the engine and the specific weight balance of the special edition, which has an eight-millimetre-lower ride height.\n\nThe striking exterior of the BMW M2 CS is headlined by a host of components made from CFRP and exclusive details such as the M exterior mirror caps familiar from the BMW M2*, the M Carbon roof – which comes as standard on the special-edition model – and the CS-specific rear diffusor. The interior of the new BMW M2 CS combines an exclusive look with the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara and innovative lightweight design, examples of which include the CFRP centre console and the weight-optimised, heated M Carbon front bucket seats finished in Merino leather.\n\nWith in-car gaming via AirConsole, users can enjoy world-renowned classic titles.\n\nVisitors to the BMW Group stand in Tokyo can also experience in-car gaming via AirConsole, as introduced for the first time with BMW Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will offer this feature, which comes with world-renowned titles like the classic card game UNO® from Mattel – here tailored for in-car gaming and renamed “UNO® Car Party!”. Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) is a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world.\n\nBMW customers also gain exclusive access to the Hot Wheels: Xtreme OverdriveTM game that AirConsole – in collaboration with Mattel – has added to its game library. In this game, players can earn points with the virtual BMW Vision Neue Klasse X in races on the Panoramic Drive Track, unlock legendary Hot Wheels cars and customize them. This makes every race a showcase for the performance and style of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X.\n\nAt the same time, AirConsole will also release PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition from Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. to BMW for the first time. This brand-specific version of the arcade classic has been customized with exclusive BMW items, bringing a unique twist to one of the world’s best known games. AirConsole allows customers to use their smartphones as controllers so that all the passengers on board can play against each other.\n\nBMW Concept Speedtop: the sports Touring, redefined.\n\nAdding a particularly exclusive head-turner to the vehicles on display at the BMW Group’s Japan Mobility Show 2025 stand is the unique BMW Concept Speedtop. This three-door concept car was unveiled for the first time in May this year at the Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy. The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring model type, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with a fresh design language. The exclusivity of the BMW Concept Speedtop (which will be offered in a strictly limited-run small series of 70 cars) is underscored by its exquisite engine – the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.\n\nThe exterior of the BMW Concept Speedtop is marked out by the pronounced V-shape of the “shark-nose” front end, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidneys. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler imbues the car with a dynamic Touring profile, its broad haunches further enriching the athletic design. And its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke fan-style wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop. A two-tone colour and materials concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tones of the Floating Sunstone Maroon exterior paint finish are carried over into the cabin in the form of the brown Sundown Maroon colour world with the light Moonstone White of the seats. In addition, skilfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and visualise the manufactory-level craftsmanship on display. The boot of the BMW Concept Speedtop is also leather-covered and adorned with brogue-style perforations. The elaborate craftsmanship of the exterior and interior was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing.\n\nBMW X7 meets Japanese craftsmanship.\n\nThe BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge concept car presented at the Japan Mobility Show embodies the elegant symbiosis of luxurious driving comfort and traditional Japanese craftsmanship. With space for up to seven people, this attractive concept model based on the BMW X7 also offers high practicality. A tranquil space filled with beauty, where stars twinkle, the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge creates a gentle, expansive sanctuary. Here in the cabin, the refined brilliance of BMW's exclusive appointments is artistically combined with the vast expanse of a starry sky, crafted using traditional Kyoto techniques.\n\nA dedicated two-tone paint scheme instantly conveys the exclusive aura of the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge. Complementing the main colour BMW Individual Velvet Blue, the roof section is painted in Space Silver to evoke the shimmer of nebulae shining in the cosmos. The Crystal Light Headlights emit an infinite, jewel-like brilliance, enhanced by gentle Iconic Glow light. The interior features a Panoramic Skyroof with 15,000 LEDs projecting a pale blue starlight at night, while the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System expresses the light shining on the earth through sound.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: Energy consumption combined (WLTP): 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: (WLTP): 0 g/km; CO2 class: A BMW iX5 Hydrogen: As this is a development-phase prototype, energy consumption information according to WLTP is not available yet.

The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 3.4 seconds and top speed is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph). The chassis technology and braking system of the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the uprated performance characteristics of the engine and the specific weight balance of the special edition, which has an eight-millimetre-lower ride height.\n\nThe striking exterior of the BMW M2 CS is headlined by a host of components made from CFRP and exclusive details such as the M exterior mirror caps familiar from the BMW M2*, the M Carbon roof – which comes as standard on the special-edition model – and the CS-specific rear diffusor. The interior of the new BMW M2 CS combines an exclusive look with the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara and innovative lightweight design, examples of which include the CFRP centre console and the weight-optimised, heated M Carbon front bucket seats finished in Merino leather.\n\nWith in-car gaming via AirConsole, users can enjoy world-renowned classic titles.\n\nVisitors to the BMW Group stand in Tokyo can also experience in-car gaming via AirConsole, as introduced for the first time with BMW Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will offer this feature, which comes with world-renowned titles like the classic card game UNO® from Mattel – here tailored for in-car gaming and renamed “UNO® Car Party!”. Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) is a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world.\n\nBMW customers also gain exclusive access to the Hot Wheels: Xtreme OverdriveTM game that AirConsole – in collaboration with Mattel – has added to its game library. In this game, players can earn points with the virtual BMW Vision Neue Klasse X in races on the Panoramic Drive Track, unlock legendary Hot Wheels cars and customize them. This makes every race a showcase for the performance and style of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X.\n\nAt the same time, AirConsole will also release PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition from Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. to BMW for the first time. This brand-specific version of the arcade classic has been customized with exclusive BMW items, bringing a unique twist to one of the world’s best known games. AirConsole allows customers to use their smartphones as controllers so that all the passengers on board can play against each other.\n\nBMW Concept Speedtop: the sports Touring, redefined.\n\nAdding a particularly exclusive head-turner to the vehicles on display at the BMW Group’s Japan Mobility Show 2025 stand is the unique BMW Concept Speedtop. This three-door concept car was unveiled for the first time in May this year at the Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy. The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring model type, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with a fresh design language. The exclusivity of the BMW Concept Speedtop (which will be offered in a strictly limited-run small series of 70 cars) is underscored by its exquisite engine – the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.\n\nThe exterior of the BMW Concept Speedtop is marked out by the pronounced V-shape of the “shark-nose” front end, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidneys. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler imbues the car with a dynamic Touring profile, its broad haunches further enriching the athletic design. And its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke fan-style wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop. A two-tone colour and materials concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tones of the Floating Sunstone Maroon exterior paint finish are carried over into the cabin in the form of the brown Sundown Maroon colour world with the light Moonstone White of the seats. In addition, skilfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and visualise the manufactory-level craftsmanship on display. The boot of the BMW Concept Speedtop is also leather-covered and adorned with brogue-style perforations. The elaborate craftsmanship of the exterior and interior was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing.\n\nBMW X7 meets Japanese craftsmanship.\n\nThe BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge concept car presented at the Japan Mobility Show embodies the elegant symbiosis of luxurious driving comfort and traditional Japanese craftsmanship. With space for up to seven people, this attractive concept model based on the BMW X7 also offers high practicality. A tranquil space filled with beauty, where stars twinkle, the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge creates a gentle, expansive sanctuary. Here in the cabin, the refined brilliance of BMW's exclusive appointments is artistically combined with the vast expanse of a starry sky, crafted using traditional Kyoto techniques.\n\nA dedicated two-tone paint scheme instantly conveys the exclusive aura of the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge. Complementing the main colour BMW Individual Velvet Blue, the roof section is painted in Space Silver to evoke the shimmer of nebulae shining in the cosmos. The Crystal Light Headlights emit an infinite, jewel-like brilliance, enhanced by gentle Iconic Glow light. The interior features a Panoramic Skyroof with 15,000 LEDs projecting a pale blue starlight at night, while the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System expresses the light shining on the earth through sound.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: Energy consumption combined (WLTP): 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: (WLTP): 0 g/km; CO2 class: A BMW iX5 Hydrogen: As this is a development-phase prototype, energy consumption information according to WLTP is not available yet.

To mark the anniversary year, BMW is bringing another highlight to Berlin: as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, the 19th BMW Art Car, designed by John Baldessari, is displayed on the terrace of the Neue Nationalgalerie. With this world tour, BMW is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Cars this year and next.

This is made possible by a dedicated budget funded by the Freunde der Nationalgalerie and BMW.\n\n\"The Preis der Nationalgalerie was established at a time when contemporary art in Berlin received significantly less support. Today, Berlin is one of the most important centres for the production and presentation of contemporary art.

The award has always been distinguished by its ability to respond positively to changes in the interests of the museum, the artists, and the audience. This has not only maintained but increased its relevance over the decades.

With this largest exhibition project in the history of the BMW Art Cars, all 20 vehicles will be shown worldwide in leading museums and institutions. The series, which began in 1975 with Alexander Calder, continues to unite outstanding artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jenny Holzer, David Hockney, Jeff Koons, Esther Mahlangu, Olafur Eliasson, Cao Fei, and Julie Mehretu. For five decades, the BMW Art Cars have combined art and design, technology and innovation, motorsport and engineering – embodying the essence of the BMW Group's global cultural engagement, which includes over 100 initiatives in contemporary art, music, film, and design.\n\nThe BMW Art Car designed by John Baldessari (1931–2020) is considered one of the most distinctive works in the series. Known for his coloured dots and shapes, the Californian artist aimed to create a \"typical Baldessari\" and simultaneously crafted an icon of motorsport. A large red dot on the roof ensures perfect visibility on the track. The word \"FAST\" on the driver's side serves as an energetic reminder of the essence of racing.

This has not only maintained but increased its relevance over the decades.

With this largest exhibition project in the history of the BMW Art Cars, all 20 vehicles will be shown worldwide in leading museums and institutions. The series, which began in 1975 with Alexander Calder, continues to unite outstanding artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jenny Holzer, David Hockney, Jeff Koons, Esther Mahlangu, Olafur Eliasson, Cao Fei, and Julie Mehretu. For five decades, the BMW Art Cars have combined art and design, technology and innovation, motorsport and engineering – embodying the essence of the BMW Group's global cultural engagement, which includes over 100 initiatives in contemporary art, music, film, and design.\n\nThe BMW Art Car designed by John Baldessari (1931–2020) is considered one of the most distinctive works in the series. Known for his coloured dots and shapes, the Californian artist aimed to create a \"typical Baldessari\" and simultaneously crafted an icon of motorsport. A large red dot on the roof ensures perfect visibility on the track. The word \"FAST\" on the driver's side serves as an energetic reminder of the essence of racing. On the passenger side, the vehicle itself is depicted – a tribute to the designers.

From then on, solo exhibitions will honour artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively shown in Berlin. With the change of venue, contemporary art will engage in dialogue with the collection and history of the Neue Nationalgalerie.

The DTM title race continues to heat up – and Schubert Motorsport is right in the thick of it, along with BMW M works drivers René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER). The highlight of the penultimate race weekend of the season at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) was Saturday's race, where Rast and Wittmann secured a one-two finish with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. In qualifying, Wittmann claimed pole position ahead of Rast. On Sunday, both drivers faced greater challenges, partly due to the success ballast from their one-two finish the day before. Nevertheless, they still have realistic chances of winning the drivers' title at the season finale at Hockenheim (GER). Schubert Motorsport also remains in contention to defend their title in the team standings.\n\nIn the first race, Wittmann and Rast capitalised on the strengths of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Red Bull Ring and dominated the action. Rast took the lead after just a few laps and confidently secured his 31st DTM victory. For Wittmann, it looked like a third-place finish until the final lap, but a spin by Jack Aitken (GBR, Ferrari) ahead of him moved him up to second place.\n\nWith his victory, Rast temporarily took the lead in the drivers' standings but had to relinquish it again on Sunday. Due to the success ballast in his car, he faced significantly more challenges starting from seventh on the grid compared to Saturday but still fought for a top-five result. However, two rule violations during the final pit stop and subsequent \"slow zone\" penalties dropped him back to 13th place. Wittmann finished just ahead of him in 12th. After being hit at the rear at the start and nearly spinning, Wittmann fought his way back strongly from the back of the field.\n\nHeading into the final two races at Hockenheim, Rast sits third in the standings with 160 points, 11 points behind the leader.

The twin brothers had already delivered a strong performance in the first race, narrowly missing the podium with a fourth-place finish.

The DTM title race continues to heat up – and Schubert Motorsport is right in the thick of it, along with BMW M works drivers René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER). The highlight of the penultimate race weekend of the season at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) was Saturday's race, where Rast and Wittmann secured a one-two finish with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. In qualifying, Wittmann claimed pole position ahead of Rast. On Sunday, both drivers faced greater challenges, partly due to the success ballast from their one-two finish the day before. Nevertheless, they still have realistic chances of winning the drivers' title at the season finale at Hockenheim (GER). Schubert Motorsport also remains in contention to defend their title in the team standings.\n\nIn the first race, Wittmann and Rast capitalised on the strengths of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Red Bull Ring and dominated the action. Rast took the lead after just a few laps and confidently secured his 31st DTM victory. For Wittmann, it looked like a third-place finish until the final lap, but a spin by Jack Aitken (GBR, Ferrari) ahead of him moved him up to second place.\n\nWith his victory, Rast temporarily took the lead in the drivers' standings but had to relinquish it again on Sunday. Due to the success ballast in his car, he faced significantly more challenges starting from seventh on the grid compared to Saturday but still fought for a top-five result. However, two rule violations during the final pit stop and subsequent \"slow zone\" penalties dropped him back to 13th place. Wittmann finished just ahead of him in 12th. After being hit at the rear at the start and nearly spinning, Wittmann fought his way back strongly from the back of the field.\n\nHeading into the final two races at Hockenheim, Rast sits third in the standings with 160 points, 11 points behind the leader. Wittmann, with 150 points, is seventh and still in the title race. In the team standings, Schubert Motorsport is second with 300 points, trailing the leader by 16 points. The mission to defend the title continues.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Schubert Motorsport on the podium. Schubert Motorsport also had a strong weekend at the Red Bull Ring in the ADAC GT Masters. In Sunday’s race, Sandro and Juliano Holzem (both GER) drove the #56 BMW M4 GT3 EVO to a second-place finish on the podium. The twin brothers had already delivered a strong performance in the first race, narrowly missing the podium with a fourth-place finish. FK Performance Motorsport struggled with its two cars and missed out on top positions. In the ADAC GT4 Germany, no BMW M4 GT4 EVO made it to the podium this time.\n\nComments on the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"What a weekend! Saturday couldn’t have gone better. The one-two finish was exactly what we needed in the tight championship battle. We knew we wouldn’t be able to repeat this fantastic performance on Sunday, but missing out on the top ten was still disappointing. We left some points on the table, but the most important thing is that we head to Hockenheim with realistic title chances. Schubert Motorsport also performed strongly in the ADAC GT Masters. Congratulations to the Holzem brothers for their podium on Sunday and an overall strong team performance. Unfortunately, we couldn’t make it to the podium with the BMW M4 GT4 EVO this time, but we’ll come back fighting at Hockenheim.\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): \"The one-two finish on Saturday was fantastic and exactly what we needed to put ourselves in a strong position for the season finale in the title race. Unfortunately, Sunday turned out to be the tough race we expected. Marco was unlucky with the contact in the first corner but fought his way back well. For René, things were going very well until the second pit stop. It’s frustrating that both he and we as a team received penalties, as that cost René some valuable points. But with 56 points still up for grabs at Hockenheim, our drivers are 11 and 21 points behind, and we as a team are 16 points back. We need to secure as many of those 56 points as possible. I’m also pleased with our performance in the ADAC GT Masters this weekend. The podium is a nice reward for the team.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 1st place, R2: 13th place): \"All in all, it was a good weekend. We celebrated a one-two finish on Saturday and closed the gap to the top of the standings. Unfortunately, we lost some points on Sunday due to the two penalties, which dampens the overall impression a bit. But the important thing is that we still have everything to play for at Hockenheim.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 2nd place, R2: 12th place): \"I leave the Red Bull Ring with mixed feelings. My crew and I did a perfect job in both races and made great improvements, especially from Friday to Saturday. Pole position was the perfect reward for that. The one-two finish in the race was fantastic for the team, even though I would have loved to win from pole. On Sunday, after the incident at the start, we were at the back of the field but never gave up and did the best possible damage control. It’s a shame we left some points behind, but the last four races have shown how quickly things can change in this DTM season. If my crew and I work together as brilliantly as we did here, everything is still possible at Hockenheim.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport, GT Racing, Customer Racing"}]}

The Sport variant captivates thanks to a finish in Marina Bay Blue metallic with outsized “46” graphics in Tanzanite Blue metallic and bright yellow accents on the BMW M kidney grille, the brake calipers and the forged light-alloy wheels. In the “Style” design variant, the bodywork comes in matte Frozen Tanzanite Blue metallic, with the “46” in Frozen Marina Bay Blue metallic. The carbon-fibre roof of both variants is adorned with the VR46 logo and Rossi’s signature. Both the bonnet and the roof were manufactured and individually painted at BMW Group Plant Landshut. The component plant also provided the lightweight high-precision struts for the engine compartment and engine parts such as the crankcase and the cylinder head, which were installed in the high-performance drive system at BMW Group Plant Steyr.\n\nSpecial production processes at BMW Group Werk DingolfingThe production of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 reveals the impressive levels of flexibility and skill applied to manufacturing exclusive small-batch series at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. The Jeff Koons edition models for the BMW 8 Series and the 50 examples of the BMW 3.0 CSL first saw the light of day at the Bavarian plant, where high-tech manufacturing and craftsmanship go hand in hand, in the paint shop in particular.\n\nFor the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, an underlying colour tone was applied as primer before the cars were removed from the series production process. The entire paintwork surface was then sanded down to improve the adhesion of the subsequent paint layers. The paintwork experts in Dingolfing then applied specially-made stencils to mask the “46” and other design elements, such as the bright yellow lines on the rear end and the A-column, before adding the contrast colour to the masking film. Once all the layers of paint had dried and the masking film had been removed, a clear varnish coating was added to the design area by hand and then sanded down – after drying again – to guarantee seamless transitions and a flawless surface. The cars then returned to the regular series production process to receive another layer of clear varnish and for the installation of the carbon-fibre roof that was manufactured in Landshut. Overall, each car required 20 hours’ work from a small team of four hand-picked paint experts to complete the exclusive BMW Individual paint finish on the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46.\n\nVehicle assembly: components and interior characterised by VR46The next step in the production process took the edition cars to Dingolfing for assembly. The exclusive design is also reflected in the installed components, such as the bumpers specially painted in Landshut, and on the inside of the car. Night Blue dominates in the interior, with yellow accents. The M Carbon bucket seats have a shoulder area in Sao Paulo Yellow, with yellow contrast stitching and a yellow centre marker on the steering wheel. The headrests and door sill trims feature a prominent yellow VR46 logo, while the carbon-fibre centre console of all examples features a “1/46” badge. Having passed extensive quality controls, the cars of this exclusive edition are now ready for delivery to the two sets of 46 customers around the world.\n\nIncludes a “once in a lifetime” experience for customersCustomers who purchase one of the 405 kW/550 HP BMW M4 CS Edition VR46s also enjoy the added value of a “once in a lifetime” experience: an exclusive personal meeting with Valentino Rossi at his home, the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia (ITA), and a BMW M Driving Experience with current BMW M models at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli. Rossi, at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3, won GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup races at his home circuit in both 2023 and 2024 and is aiming to complete a hat-trick this year. “The Doctor” has been a BMW M works driver since the start of the 2023 season, plying his trade at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 for BMW M Team WRT, having called time on his motorcycle career at the 2021 season finale and turned his attention solely to car racing. He had already attended multiple tests in Formula 1 race cars and made guest appearances in rallies and endurance races. The Italian has been competing as a BMW M works driver in the GT World Challenge Europe, with the 24 Hours of Spa (BEL) as a highlight, as well as racing in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) or at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), where he celebrated second place in the BMW M4 GT3 at the opening round of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC).\n\nCreating a legend on two wheels“Il Dottore” had already become a living legend and global motorsport and style icon on two wheels. With nine world championships and no fewer than 115 Grand Prix victories to his name, he is one of the three most successful motorcycle racers in history. Rossi claimed his first world title in the 125cc class in 1997. Two years later, he added the title in the 250cc class. In 2000, he took the step up to what was the top Grand Prix category, the 500cc class, in which he was crowned world champion in 2001. Rossi remained the dominant force when this category was replaced by the MotoGP class the following year. By 2005 he had added a further four world titles, and numbers eight and nine were to follow in 2008 and 2009. VR46 became a world-famous trademark – and Rossi’s home town of Tavullia even reduced its speed limit from the usual 50 km/h to 46 km/h in his honour.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption and emission figures:Fuel consumption combined: 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 232 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Exclusive edition model in collaboration with BMW M works driver Valentino Rossi is limited to two sets of 46 cars +++ BMW Group Plant Dingolfing produces BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, combining large-scale efficiency with manufacturing processes +++"}]}

The component plant also provided the lightweight high-precision struts for the engine compartment and engine parts such as the crankcase and the cylinder head, which were installed in the high-performance drive system at BMW Group Plant Steyr.\n\nSpecial production processes at BMW Group Werk DingolfingThe production of the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46 reveals the impressive levels of flexibility and skill applied to manufacturing exclusive small-batch series at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. The Jeff Koons edition models for the BMW 8 Series and the 50 examples of the BMW 3.0 CSL first saw the light of day at the Bavarian plant, where high-tech manufacturing and craftsmanship go hand in hand, in the paint shop in particular.\n\nFor the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46, an underlying colour tone was applied as primer before the cars were removed from the series production process. The entire paintwork surface was then sanded down to improve the adhesion of the subsequent paint layers. The paintwork experts in Dingolfing then applied specially-made stencils to mask the “46” and other design elements, such as the bright yellow lines on the rear end and the A-column, before adding the contrast colour to the masking film. Once all the layers of paint had dried and the masking film had been removed, a clear varnish coating was added to the design area by hand and then sanded down – after drying again – to guarantee seamless transitions and a flawless surface. The cars then returned to the regular series production process to receive another layer of clear varnish and for the installation of the carbon-fibre roof that was manufactured in Landshut. Overall, each car required 20 hours’ work from a small team of four hand-picked paint experts to complete the exclusive BMW Individual paint finish on the BMW M4 CS Edition VR46.\n\nVehicle assembly: components and interior characterised by VR46The next step in the production process took the edition cars to Dingolfing for assembly. The exclusive design is also reflected in the installed components, such as the bumpers specially painted in Landshut, and on the inside of the car. Night Blue dominates in the interior, with yellow accents. The M Carbon bucket seats have a shoulder area in Sao Paulo Yellow, with yellow contrast stitching and a yellow centre marker on the steering wheel. The headrests and door sill trims feature a prominent yellow VR46 logo, while the carbon-fibre centre console of all examples features a “1/46” badge. Having passed extensive quality controls, the cars of this exclusive edition are now ready for delivery to the two sets of 46 customers around the world.\n\nIncludes a “once in a lifetime” experience for customersCustomers who purchase one of the 405 kW/550 HP BMW M4 CS Edition VR46s also enjoy the added value of a “once in a lifetime” experience: an exclusive personal meeting with Valentino Rossi at his home, the VR46 Motor Ranch in Tavullia (ITA), and a BMW M Driving Experience with current BMW M models at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli. Rossi, at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3, won GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup races at his home circuit in both 2023 and 2024 and is aiming to complete a hat-trick this year. “The Doctor” has been a BMW M works driver since the start of the 2023 season, plying his trade at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 for BMW M Team WRT, having called time on his motorcycle career at the 2021 season finale and turned his attention solely to car racing. He had already attended multiple tests in Formula 1 race cars and made guest appearances in rallies and endurance races. The Italian has been competing as a BMW M works driver in the GT World Challenge Europe, with the 24 Hours of Spa (BEL) as a highlight, as well as racing in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) or at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), where he celebrated second place in the BMW M4 GT3 at the opening round of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC).\n\nCreating a legend on two wheels“Il Dottore” had already become a living legend and global motorsport and style icon on two wheels. With nine world championships and no fewer than 115 Grand Prix victories to his name, he is one of the three most successful motorcycle racers in history. Rossi claimed his first world title in the 125cc class in 1997. Two years later, he added the title in the 250cc class. In 2000, he took the step up to what was the top Grand Prix category, the 500cc class, in which he was crowned world champion in 2001. Rossi remained the dominant force when this category was replaced by the MotoGP class the following year. By 2005 he had added a further four world titles, and numbers eight and nine were to follow in 2008 and 2009. VR46 became a world-famous trademark – and Rossi’s home town of Tavullia even reduced its speed limit from the usual 50 km/h to 46 km/h in his honour.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: *Consumption and emission figures:Fuel consumption combined: 10.2 l/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 232 g/km in the WLTP cycle, CO2 class: G."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Mixed emotions for the BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers after the #FIA GT World Cup in #Macau (CHN). Throughout much of the weekend, the pace of the four BMW M4 GT3s on the Guia Circuit was very strong, culminating in a one-two finish for Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in Saturday's qualification race. Consequently, the duo started the main race from the front row. However, under very challenging conditions due to the rain, they were unable to capitalise on the strengths of their cars. Both were eliminated following incidents. This time, it was Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) who celebrated on the podium, finishing second and third, respectively.\n\nOverall, despite the two podium finishes, the disappointment over the missed victory in the main race prevailed due to the course of events on Sunday. Marciello and Vanthoor initially defended first and second places, but it quickly became clear that other cars coped better with the wet conditions than the BMW M4 GT3, whose performance had already been reduced compared to the competition after qualifying on Friday. Vanthoor came under pressure from the eventual winner Maro Engel (GER, Mercedes), who hit him in the rear during an overtaking attempt and pushed him into the barriers. As a result, Vanthoor's race was over. Marciello fought with Antonio Fuoco (ITA, Ferrari) for the lead. Both cars engaged in a tough duel, which ended with a slight collision and a slide into the runoff area for both.\n\nDue to the incidents, Farfus and van der Linde advanced from starting positions five and six to the front and were able to celebrate on the podium. Farfus reached the podium last year, finishing third, and for van der Linde, it was his first podium at his second Macau start. The weekend was also special for the South African for another reason. He competed in a special design in the style of Chinese Manhua comics, developed by BMW M Motorsport together with Premium Technology Partner Shell. It featured a dragon and van der Linde as an animated character. This character was also available on-site as merchandise for guests and fans.\n\nComments on the FIA GT World Cup:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We have shown that we had four incredibly strong cars at the start – with top teams and great support. Occupying the front row and having all four cars in the top-six showcased our strong performance. There was an adjustment to the balance of performance for the BMW M4 GT3 before the qualification race, but we still managed to defend our very good starting positions and win the race. In the main race, it became clear that our car was not the fastest and we fell back. Unfortunately, there was also an incident between Maro Engel and Dries Vanthoor, which in our view was not appropriately penalised, resulting in Dries' race ending prematurely while he was in third place. Of course, it's a great result to have two cars on the podium with Augusto Farfus and Sheldon van der Linde. But when you compete here, you want to win the race. And I believe we had arguably the strongest line-up, but not the chance to win.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#89 BMW M4 GT3, Team KRC, 2nd place main race, 5th place qualification race): “Macau is always a surprise package. I drove for a new team, a team from Macau, which makes me very proud. BMW M Motorsport has supported us as a small team very well, which is great. We worked closely together, and now I'm back on the podium. This weekend was probably the toughest I've had in Macau, with all kinds of weather conditions and situations. The weather played a big role this time. A dry race would certainly have produced a different result but I am very satisfied with what I have achieved.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 BMW M4 GT3, Team WRT, 3rd place main race, 6th place qualification race): “This is my first podium in Macau. Of course, it's a special feeling, especially after I was third last year and lost the podium in the last five laps due to a tyre puncture so it feels good, even if it was somewhat unexpected before the race. When you start from sixth place, you don't really expect to make up three positions in Macau. I had a lot of pressure from behind with the two Porsches, which were flying in the rain. It was very difficult to keep them behind me. But I knew if I got out of the Melco corner well, they couldn't attack. I'm very proud to stand on the podium here. It's a nice reward for all the work we've done over the past two years, which hasn't really been rewarded yet.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#1 BMW M4 GT3, TORO Racing powered by MCG, DNF main race, 1st place qualification race): “The weekend started very well, we were in the best position. It's a shame how the main race went. Unfortunately, we had the worst conditions for our car today, but we were only two laps away from victory.

Throughout much of the weekend, the pace of the four BMW M4 GT3s on the Guia Circuit was very strong, culminating in a one-two finish for Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in Saturday's qualification race. Consequently, the duo started the main race from the front row. However, under very challenging conditions due to the rain, they were unable to capitalise on the strengths of their cars. Both were eliminated following incidents. This time, it was Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) who celebrated on the podium, finishing second and third, respectively.\n\nOverall, despite the two podium finishes, the disappointment over the missed victory in the main race prevailed due to the course of events on Sunday. Marciello and Vanthoor initially defended first and second places, but it quickly became clear that other cars coped better with the wet conditions than the BMW M4 GT3, whose performance had already been reduced compared to the competition after qualifying on Friday. Vanthoor came under pressure from the eventual winner Maro Engel (GER, Mercedes), who hit him in the rear during an overtaking attempt and pushed him into the barriers. As a result, Vanthoor's race was over. Marciello fought with Antonio Fuoco (ITA, Ferrari) for the lead. Both cars engaged in a tough duel, which ended with a slight collision and a slide into the runoff area for both.\n\nDue to the incidents, Farfus and van der Linde advanced from starting positions five and six to the front and were able to celebrate on the podium. Farfus reached the podium last year, finishing third, and for van der Linde, it was his first podium at his second Macau start. The weekend was also special for the South African for another reason. He competed in a special design in the style of Chinese Manhua comics, developed by BMW M Motorsport together with Premium Technology Partner Shell. It featured a dragon and van der Linde as an animated character. This character was also available on-site as merchandise for guests and fans.\n\nComments on the FIA GT World Cup:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We have shown that we had four incredibly strong cars at the start – with top teams and great support. Occupying the front row and having all four cars in the top-six showcased our strong performance. There was an adjustment to the balance of performance for the BMW M4 GT3 before the qualification race, but we still managed to defend our very good starting positions and win the race. In the main race, it became clear that our car was not the fastest and we fell back. Unfortunately, there was also an incident between Maro Engel and Dries Vanthoor, which in our view was not appropriately penalised, resulting in Dries' race ending prematurely while he was in third place. Of course, it's a great result to have two cars on the podium with Augusto Farfus and Sheldon van der Linde. But when you compete here, you want to win the race. And I believe we had arguably the strongest line-up, but not the chance to win.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#89 BMW M4 GT3, Team KRC, 2nd place main race, 5th place qualification race): “Macau is always a surprise package. I drove for a new team, a team from Macau, which makes me very proud. BMW M Motorsport has supported us as a small team very well, which is great. We worked closely together, and now I'm back on the podium. This weekend was probably the toughest I've had in Macau, with all kinds of weather conditions and situations. The weather played a big role this time. A dry race would certainly have produced a different result but I am very satisfied with what I have achieved.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 BMW M4 GT3, Team WRT, 3rd place main race, 6th place qualification race): “This is my first podium in Macau. Of course, it's a special feeling, especially after I was third last year and lost the podium in the last five laps due to a tyre puncture so it feels good, even if it was somewhat unexpected before the race. When you start from sixth place, you don't really expect to make up three positions in Macau. I had a lot of pressure from behind with the two Porsches, which were flying in the rain. It was very difficult to keep them behind me. But I knew if I got out of the Melco corner well, they couldn't attack. I'm very proud to stand on the podium here. It's a nice reward for all the work we've done over the past two years, which hasn't really been rewarded yet.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#1 BMW M4 GT3, TORO Racing powered by MCG, DNF main race, 1st place qualification race): “The weekend started very well, we were in the best position.

In the air it was this perfect baby draw, riding the wind, and landed it perfectly and it trickled in at perfect speed as well.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kazuma Kobori sunk the first ace of the new season on the 17th hole. He might not have been rewarded with a hole-in-one car, but the shot helped the New Zealander enter the BMW PGA Australian Championship weekend in the lead. Gale is currently in tied for 18th place with Major winner and former world number one Adam Scott (AUS), and others.\n\nThis is the second edition for which BMW is title partner of the BMW PGA Australian Championship, the newest member of the family of BMW title tournaments on four continents. The other tournaments include the BMW PGA Championship in London (ENG), the BMW International Open in Munich (both on the DP World Tour), the penultimate playoff tournament on the PGA TOUR, the BMW Championship (USA), as well as the BMW Ladies Championship (LPGA Tour) in Korea. Once again a multitude of top players are competing at the BMW Australian PGA Championship in 2025, including BMW Australia’s golf ambassadors Min Woo Lee and Elvis Smylie. They both have brilliant memories of the tournament: Min Woo Lee won it in 2023, Elvis Smylie was victorious last year.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Touring: Energy consumption, weighted, combined: 2.0 l/100 km [141.2 mpg imp] and 30.7 kWh/ 100 km; CO2 emissions, weighted, combined: 46 g/ km; fuel consumption with discharged battery: 10.9 l/100 km [25.9 mpg imp] in the WLTP cycle; CO2 classes, weighted, combined: B, with discharged battery G."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The American abstract painter, born in Ethiopia in 1970, first presented her artistically designed BMW M Hybrid V8 to the public at the Centre Pompidou in Paris in May 2024. After its race deployment in Le Mans a month later, this year marks the next chapter of the project in cooperation with the BMW Group: the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC).\n\nThe idea for the pan-African artist network was developed by Julie Mehretu together with her longtime friend, Mehret Mandefro, an Emmy-nominated film producer—also born in Ethiopia and living in the USA—and co-founder of the Realness Institute for the training of African filmmakers in conversation with artist Paul Pfeiffer and architectural historian Lawrence Chua. Under the guidance of a group of African and international artists, including French-Senegalese filmmaker and 2024 Berlinale winner Mati Diop, American poet Robin Coste Lewis, and Kenyan performance artist Jim Chuchu, workshops will be held in Lagos, Dakar, Tangier, Nairobi, and Cape Town for around 50 artists. AFMAC will connect with local host cultural institutions on site and workshop participants will be selected through open calls with the partners. The kickoff will take place from April 15–19 in Lagos with the cultural non-profit organization \"Angels & Muse\".\n\n“BMW is working for the first time in the 50-year history of the BMW Art Car Collection with an artist to develop the idea far beyond the car as a pure art object. This collaboration is particularly close to my heart. It expands BMW’s long-term global commitment in the film sector with an outstanding initiative that stands for exchange, creativity, and cultural diversity—values that we, as a company, also embody,” says Ilka Horstmeier, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources, and Real Estate.\n\nEach workshop results in a new film production. Once completed, the films will form an anthology of contemporary African filmmaking, which will complement exhibitions of Mehretu’s 20th BMW Art Car. In 2026, the anthology will debut in a major exhibition dedicated to AFMAC along with the 20th Art Car at Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town. The former Executive Director Koyo Kouoh (1967-2025) played a key role championing the project before her sudden and untimely death. The BMW Group has been a partner of the museum for many years, contributing its extensive network of cultural professionals and charitable institutions in Africa to establish AFMAC on a long-term and sustainable basis.\n\nInternational collaboration and access to African film historySocial engagement and engaging with peers in collectives have always shaped Mehretu's work. In 2004, she founded the artist residency Denniston Hill in North New York with Pfeiffer and Chua. Meant as a place for exchange, reflection, and retreat, artists of various disciplines and backgrounds further develop their practice there. Workshop methods conceived at Denniston Hill form the foundation for AFMAC’s workshops, where artists from various African countries and the global diaspora come together to engage with questions of cultural, political, and historical identity. The forms of experimentation that a translocal collective enables, how cultural and political heritage can be negotiated, and the role different media play in the attribution of identity forms are examined.\n\nUsing archival material of African film and media works, participants are given the opportunity to develop their own creative approaches and create new forms of media art. Accordingly, a key component of the workshops is the screening of hard-to-access African films to expand historical and cultural perspectives. The goal is to create sustainable infrastructures that last beyond the workshops and strengthen the artistic community in Africa. A central point of approach is the provision of an online film archive that African artists can continuously work with in the future.\n\nArtist talks and public presentations of AFMAC will also take place outside of Africa in 2025 and 2026. An event calendar and further detailed information, including photo and film material, are available at a digital platform documenting the project and archive for African cinema, created by New York-based creative agency Pacific.\n\nAfrican Film and Media Arts Collective – stationsApril 15–19, 2025: Lagos, Nigeria, in partnership with Angels & Muse Lead artist: Coco Fusco\n\nJuly 2025: Tangier, Morocco, in partnership with Cinematheque de TangerLead artist: Zeresenay Berhane Mehari\n\nSeptember 2025: Dakar, Senegal, in partnership with Fanta Sy and Raw Material Company Lead artist: Mati Diop\n\nOctober 2025: Nairobi, Kenya, community partner to be determined Lead artists: Jim Chuchu and Wanuri Kahiu\n\nDecember 2025: Cape Town, South Africa, in partnership with Realness Institute Lead artist: The Otolith Group\n\nBiographies of the founders and lead artists\n\nJulie Mehretu is a world-renowned American artist, born in Addis Ababa in 1970.

The American abstract painter, born in Ethiopia in 1970, first presented her artistically designed BMW M Hybrid V8 to the public at the Centre Pompidou in Paris in May 2024. After its race deployment in Le Mans a month later, this year marks the next chapter of the project in cooperation with the BMW Group: the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC).\n\nThe idea for the pan-African artist network was developed by Julie Mehretu together with her longtime friend, Mehret Mandefro, an Emmy-nominated film producer—also born in Ethiopia and living in the USA—and co-founder of the Realness Institute for the training of African filmmakers in conversation with artist Paul Pfeiffer and architectural historian Lawrence Chua. Under the guidance of a group of African and international artists, including French-Senegalese filmmaker and 2024 Berlinale winner Mati Diop, American poet Robin Coste Lewis, and Kenyan performance artist Jim Chuchu, workshops will be held in Lagos, Dakar, Tangier, Nairobi, and Cape Town for around 50 artists. AFMAC will connect with local host cultural institutions on site and workshop participants will be selected through open calls with the partners. The kickoff will take place from April 15–19 in Lagos with the cultural non-profit organization \"Angels & Muse\".\n\n“BMW is working for the first time in the 50-year history of the BMW Art Car Collection with an artist to develop the idea far beyond the car as a pure art object. This collaboration is particularly close to my heart. It expands BMW’s long-term global commitment in the film sector with an outstanding initiative that stands for exchange, creativity, and cultural diversity—values that we, as a company, also embody,” says Ilka Horstmeier, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources, and Real Estate.\n\nEach workshop results in a new film production. Once completed, the films will form an anthology of contemporary African filmmaking, which will complement exhibitions of Mehretu’s 20th BMW Art Car. In 2026, the anthology will debut in a major exhibition dedicated to AFMAC along with the 20th Art Car at Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town. The former Executive Director Koyo Kouoh (1967-2025) played a key role championing the project before her sudden and untimely death. The BMW Group has been a partner of the museum for many years, contributing its extensive network of cultural professionals and charitable institutions in Africa to establish AFMAC on a long-term and sustainable basis.\n\nInternational collaboration and access to African film historySocial engagement and engaging with peers in collectives have always shaped Mehretu's work. In 2004, she founded the artist residency Denniston Hill in North New York with Pfeiffer and Chua. Meant as a place for exchange, reflection, and retreat, artists of various disciplines and backgrounds further develop their practice there. Workshop methods conceived at Denniston Hill form the foundation for AFMAC’s workshops, where artists from various African countries and the global diaspora come together to engage with questions of cultural, political, and historical identity. The forms of experimentation that a translocal collective enables, how cultural and political heritage can be negotiated, and the role different media play in the attribution of identity forms are examined.\n\nUsing archival material of African film and media works, participants are given the opportunity to develop their own creative approaches and create new forms of media art. Accordingly, a key component of the workshops is the screening of hard-to-access African films to expand historical and cultural perspectives. The goal is to create sustainable infrastructures that last beyond the workshops and strengthen the artistic community in Africa. A central point of approach is the provision of an online film archive that African artists can continuously work with in the future.\n\nArtist talks and public presentations of AFMAC will also take place outside of Africa in 2025 and 2026. An event calendar and further detailed information, including photo and film material, are available at a digital platform documenting the project and archive for African cinema, created by New York-based creative agency Pacific.\n\nAfrican Film and Media Arts Collective – stationsApril 15–19, 2025: Lagos, Nigeria, in partnership with Angels & Muse Lead artist: Coco Fusco\n\nJuly 2025: Tangier, Morocco, in partnership with Cinematheque de TangerLead artist: Zeresenay Berhane Mehari\n\nSeptember 2025: Dakar, Senegal, in partnership with Fanta Sy and Raw Material Company Lead artist: Mati Diop\n\nOctober 2025: Nairobi, Kenya, community partner to be determined Lead artists: Jim Chuchu and Wanuri Kahiu\n\nDecember 2025: Cape Town, South Africa, in partnership with Realness Institute Lead artist: The Otolith Group\n\nBiographies of the founders and lead artists\n\nJulie Mehretu is a world-renowned American artist, born in Addis Ababa in 1970.

Electric drivetrain upgrades, new engine variants, as well as additional standard and optional equipment features will make the current BMW model range even more attractive and versatile in spring 2025. The use of new components for the power electronics and other measures designed to optimise efficiency have resulted in a considerably increased range for the all-electric BMW i5. Standard equipment on all BMW 5 Series models will soon include ambient lighting complete with a BMW Interaction Bar featuring a crystalline surface, lumbar support for both front seats as well as the Harman Kardon HiFi loudspeaker system.\n\nTwo new variants of the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé will become available in April 2025. The BMW X3 model range will likewise be expanded, with a powerful six-cylinder in-line diesel engine. Almost 50 per cent higher charging rates – that’s the news for the plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW X1, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, BMW 7 Series and the BMW XM models. With the BMW Digital Key Plus, owners can, depending on the type of mobile device, activate up to 18 digital vehicle keys with individually configured access permissions. The new tyre repair kit Plus will become part of the standard equipment for selected BMW models from March 2025. It enables owners to continue their journey even with a tyre puncture. Adaptive LED Headlights will become part of the standard equipment for the BMW X5 and BMW X6 models in spring 2025.\n\nBMW i5 and BMW i5 Touring now even more energy-efficient.\n\nFrom March 2025 the all-electric models of the BMW 5 Series Sedan and BMW 5 Series Touring will benefit from a number of technical advances that reduce their energy consumption. The result is a noticeably greater range, with an increase of up to 47 kilometres (depending on the model and equipment installed as part of an individual vehicle configuration). This owes much to the first ever use of silicon carbide semiconductor components in the power electronics (SiC converter) of the BMW i5 and to particularly low-rolling-resistance tyres fitted to aerodynamic alloy wheels. The optimised wheel bearings will also help save power.\n\nBMW Digital Key Plus as standard in the new BMW iX.\n\nIn the new BMW iX, the BMW Digital Key Plus will become the driver’s first choice for vehicle access from March 2025. The package also includes a physical key, a Setup Card and a Service Card. The new Setup Card makes installing the Digital Key Plus on a smartphone easier than ever. Users can simply hold the card close to their mobile device or scan the QR code on the back. Once activated, drivers can safely share the Digital Key Plus with others, using a simple text message. Depending on the mobile device, up to 18 digital keys can be activated soon. Different roles and permissions can be set for the vehicle when sharing the keys. For example, the vehicle’s acceleration and top speed can be limited – a particularly useful feature for novice drivers. Moreover, the BMW Digital Key Plus enables additional control functions from the vehicle’s vicinity, such as having the BMW iX enter or exit a parking space via the My BMW app. And if there ever is a need to hand over a physical key, for example for service visits or in the event of a breakdown, the new Service Card can be activated as a full-fledged key with a single click.\n\nOther digital improvements and enhancements.The popular YouTube* video app has been available for vehicles with BMW Operating System 9 since January 2025, provided the customer has activated BMW Digital Premium. Furthermore, the Personal eSIM in BMW Operating System 9 can now be activated for improved telephony and a WiFi hotspot in the vehicle. Vehicles with BMW Operating System 8.5 benefit from a more intuitive BMW Maps interface.\n\nTyre repair kit Plus: Remaining mobile the easy way.\n\nThe new tyre repair kit Plus, part of the standard equipment for selected BMW models from March 2025, enables customers to continue their journey even with a tyre puncture. This requires just a few simple steps that are explained in the vehicle’s Integrated Owner’s Handbook. The one-piece tyre repair kit includes a magnet and connector pin to secure it to the hub of the affected wheel. A hose then fills the tyre with air and aerosol sealant using an integrated compressor. Once a sufficient tyre pressure above 1.5 bar has been achieved, the journey can be continued, with the device safely attached to the wheel hub. Drivers can now\n\n* Not available in the countries/regions of Guadeloupe, Guam, Macedonia, Martinique, Montenegro, La Réunion, Saint-Martin.\n\ncover a range of up to 200 kilometres at a top speed of 80 km/h. This should easily get them to the nearest service centre. From spring 2025 the BMW X1, BMW X2, BMW iX and various models of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer will come with this equipment feature. The tyre repair kit Plus is also included with the models of the BMW 5 Series Sedan (except for models with standard 19-inch light alloy wheels Triplex-spoke style 933 Silver).\n\nBMW X5, BMW X6, BMW X7 and BMW M5: Added equipment. The comprehensive standard equipment on the BMW X5 and BMW X6 will from spring 2025 include adaptive matrix LED headlights. The BMW X7 will always come with the Parking Assistant Professional. Standard equipment for the M60i xDrive powertrain version of all three model series will also include the M Sport package Pro, the Harman Kardon surround sound system and sun protection glazing.\n\nThe BMW M5 will also benefit from more comprehensive equipment. Two new upholstery options are available to add special accents to the interior. In addition to BMW Individual Taupe Grey/Deep Lagoon Merino Leather, BMW Individual Black/Dark Violet Merino Leather is available as a new colourway. In all BMW M5 variants, as well as in all BMW 5 Series Sedan and BMW 5 Series Touring models, the trim and switches for the power windows, mirror adjustment and tailgate button are finished in high-gloss Black with a 3D effect as standard.\n\nNew light alloy wheels for BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and BMW X1.\n\n17-inch light alloy wheels Star-spoke style 875 will be available for various BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and BMW X1 models from March 2025.\n\nAt a glance: The new, spring 2025 BMW models*\n\nBMW 2 Series Gran Coupé\n\nFuel consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (l/100 km)\n\nBMW 223 xDrive Gran Coupé\n\nEnergy consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (kWh/100 km)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan\n\nEnergy consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (kWh/100 km)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Touring\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Touring\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring\n\nFuel consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (l/100 km)\n\n* All new models available with start of production in March or May 2025 (BMW X3).\n\nAll descriptions of model variants, equipment, technical data, consumption and emission values are for vehicles as offered on the German market.\n\nEnergy consumption and emission data refer to the German Passenger Car Energy Labelling Regulation (EnVKV).\n\nAll technical data are preliminary.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nCypselus von Frankenberg, Product Communication BMW Automobiles\n\nAlexandra Landers, Head of Product and Brand Communication BMW\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide.

Electric drivetrain upgrades, new engine variants, as well as additional standard and optional equipment features will make the current BMW model range even more attractive and versatile in spring 2025. The use of new components for the power electronics and other measures designed to optimise efficiency have resulted in a considerably increased range for the all-electric BMW i5. Standard equipment on all BMW 5 Series models will soon include ambient lighting complete with a BMW Interaction Bar featuring a crystalline surface, lumbar support for both front seats as well as the Harman Kardon HiFi loudspeaker system.\n\nTwo new variants of the new BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé will become available in April 2025. The BMW X3 model range will likewise be expanded, with a powerful six-cylinder in-line diesel engine. Almost 50 per cent higher charging rates – that’s the news for the plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW X1, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, BMW 7 Series and the BMW XM models. With the BMW Digital Key Plus, owners can, depending on the type of mobile device, activate up to 18 digital vehicle keys with individually configured access permissions. The new tyre repair kit Plus will become part of the standard equipment for selected BMW models from March 2025. It enables owners to continue their journey even with a tyre puncture. Adaptive LED Headlights will become part of the standard equipment for the BMW X5 and BMW X6 models in spring 2025.\n\nBMW i5 and BMW i5 Touring now even more energy-efficient.\n\nFrom March 2025 the all-electric models of the BMW 5 Series Sedan and BMW 5 Series Touring will benefit from a number of technical advances that reduce their energy consumption. The result is a noticeably greater range, with an increase of up to 47 kilometres (depending on the model and equipment installed as part of an individual vehicle configuration). This owes much to the first ever use of silicon carbide semiconductor components in the power electronics (SiC converter) of the BMW i5 and to particularly low-rolling-resistance tyres fitted to aerodynamic alloy wheels. The optimised wheel bearings will also help save power.\n\nBMW Digital Key Plus as standard in the new BMW iX.\n\nIn the new BMW iX, the BMW Digital Key Plus will become the driver’s first choice for vehicle access from March 2025. The package also includes a physical key, a Setup Card and a Service Card. The new Setup Card makes installing the Digital Key Plus on a smartphone easier than ever. Users can simply hold the card close to their mobile device or scan the QR code on the back. Once activated, drivers can safely share the Digital Key Plus with others, using a simple text message. Depending on the mobile device, up to 18 digital keys can be activated soon. Different roles and permissions can be set for the vehicle when sharing the keys. For example, the vehicle’s acceleration and top speed can be limited – a particularly useful feature for novice drivers. Moreover, the BMW Digital Key Plus enables additional control functions from the vehicle’s vicinity, such as having the BMW iX enter or exit a parking space via the My BMW app. And if there ever is a need to hand over a physical key, for example for service visits or in the event of a breakdown, the new Service Card can be activated as a full-fledged key with a single click.\n\nOther digital improvements and enhancements.The popular YouTube* video app has been available for vehicles with BMW Operating System 9 since January 2025, provided the customer has activated BMW Digital Premium. Furthermore, the Personal eSIM in BMW Operating System 9 can now be activated for improved telephony and a WiFi hotspot in the vehicle. Vehicles with BMW Operating System 8.5 benefit from a more intuitive BMW Maps interface.\n\nTyre repair kit Plus: Remaining mobile the easy way.\n\nThe new tyre repair kit Plus, part of the standard equipment for selected BMW models from March 2025, enables customers to continue their journey even with a tyre puncture. This requires just a few simple steps that are explained in the vehicle’s Integrated Owner’s Handbook. The one-piece tyre repair kit includes a magnet and connector pin to secure it to the hub of the affected wheel. A hose then fills the tyre with air and aerosol sealant using an integrated compressor. Once a sufficient tyre pressure above 1.5 bar has been achieved, the journey can be continued, with the device safely attached to the wheel hub. Drivers can now\n\n* Not available in the countries/regions of Guadeloupe, Guam, Macedonia, Martinique, Montenegro, La Réunion, Saint-Martin.\n\ncover a range of up to 200 kilometres at a top speed of 80 km/h. This should easily get them to the nearest service centre. From spring 2025 the BMW X1, BMW X2, BMW iX and various models of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer will come with this equipment feature. The tyre repair kit Plus is also included with the models of the BMW 5 Series Sedan (except for models with standard 19-inch light alloy wheels Triplex-spoke style 933 Silver).\n\nBMW X5, BMW X6, BMW X7 and BMW M5: Added equipment. The comprehensive standard equipment on the BMW X5 and BMW X6 will from spring 2025 include adaptive matrix LED headlights. The BMW X7 will always come with the Parking Assistant Professional. Standard equipment for the M60i xDrive powertrain version of all three model series will also include the M Sport package Pro, the Harman Kardon surround sound system and sun protection glazing.\n\nThe BMW M5 will also benefit from more comprehensive equipment. Two new upholstery options are available to add special accents to the interior. In addition to BMW Individual Taupe Grey/Deep Lagoon Merino Leather, BMW Individual Black/Dark Violet Merino Leather is available as a new colourway. In all BMW M5 variants, as well as in all BMW 5 Series Sedan and BMW 5 Series Touring models, the trim and switches for the power windows, mirror adjustment and tailgate button are finished in high-gloss Black with a 3D effect as standard.\n\nNew light alloy wheels for BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and BMW X1.\n\n17-inch light alloy wheels Star-spoke style 875 will be available for various BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and BMW X1 models from March 2025.\n\nAt a glance: The new, spring 2025 BMW models*\n\nBMW 2 Series Gran Coupé\n\nFuel consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (l/100 km)\n\nBMW 223 xDrive Gran Coupé\n\nEnergy consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (kWh/100 km)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan\n\nEnergy consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (kWh/100 km)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Touring\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Touring\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring\n\nFuel consumption WLTP combined (EnVKV) (l/100 km)\n\n* All new models available with start of production in March or May 2025 (BMW X3).\n\nAll descriptions of model variants, equipment, technical data, consumption and emission values are for vehicles as offered on the German market.\n\nEnergy consumption and emission data refer to the German Passenger Car Energy Labelling Regulation (EnVKV).\n\nAll technical data are preliminary.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nCypselus von Frankenberg, Product Communication BMW Automobiles\n\nAlexandra Landers, Head of Product and Brand Communication BMW\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide.

On an exciting final Sunday, during which more than a dozen players had realistic hopes of victory, a playoff was once again required to determine the winner, just like last year. With a birdie on the first extra hole, Alex Noren secured the prestigious BMW PGA Championship title for the second time after his 2017 victory. The 43-year-old Swede triumphed with rounds of 67, 68, 66, and 68, finishing with a total score of 269 strokes (19 under par). Adrien Saddier from France needed five strokes (even par) on the first extra hole and had to settle for second place. Patrick Reed (USA) and Aaron Rai (ENG) shared third place, both finishing at 16 under par. With twelve career victories, Noren is now the most successful Swedish player in the history of the DP World Tour. A record number of 118,421 spectators flocked to the Wentworth Club this week to celebrate the Festival of Golf.\n\n“On behalf of BMW, I would like to congratulate Alex Noren on winning the 2025 BMW PGA Championship. The Festival of Golf lived up to its reputation once again, and Alex’s performance all week played a significant role in it,“ said David George, CEO at BMW Group UK and Ireland. “For more than 20 years, BMW has been a proud title partner to this outstanding golf event. It’s great to experience the sense of joy surrounding the players and fans at the BMW PGA Championship. We are equally proud to support the Golf Foundation through Eagles for Education in their efforts to strengthen mental resilience in pupils and in helping them on their way to a self-determined future.“\n\nDuring the four rounds of the BMW PGA Championship, the world-class field carded a total of 72 eagles. For each of these, the BMW Group is donating £1,000 to the Golf Foundation as part of its Eagles for Education initiative. The total sum of £72,000 will support the Golf Foundation‘s Unleash Your Drive programme, which brings simplified versions of the game of golf to schools across England. Pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged regions and underprivileged families, are taught to remain resilient, focused, and determined in the face of challenges. These skills will help to prepare youngsters for life inside and outside the classroom.\n\nNoren contributed an eagle during his four tournament rounds and owes his triumph primarily to his consistency. He was the only player to record no more than 68 strokes (4 under par) in any round. The European Ryder Cup team's vice-captain showcased his outstanding form, having won the British Masters just three weeks ago. “It’s so many emotions right now. Sometimes it comes easy. Sometimes you’ve just got to fight. Today it felt like a fight,” said Noren. “This tournament is unbelievable, it‘s one of the best tournaments in the world and it gets better every year.“\n\nAt the 2025 BMW PGA Championship, the new all-electric BMW iX3 50 xDrive celebrated its UK premiere as the tournament's Hole-in-One prize.

The Festival of Golf lived up to its reputation once again, and Alex’s performance all week played a significant role in it,“ said David George, CEO at BMW Group UK and Ireland. “For more than 20 years, BMW has been a proud title partner to this outstanding golf event. It’s great to experience the sense of joy surrounding the players and fans at the BMW PGA Championship. We are equally proud to support the Golf Foundation through Eagles for Education in their efforts to strengthen mental resilience in pupils and in helping them on their way to a self-determined future.“\n\nDuring the four rounds of the BMW PGA Championship, the world-class field carded a total of 72 eagles. For each of these, the BMW Group is donating £1,000 to the Golf Foundation as part of its Eagles for Education initiative. The total sum of £72,000 will support the Golf Foundation‘s Unleash Your Drive programme, which brings simplified versions of the game of golf to schools across England. Pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged regions and underprivileged families, are taught to remain resilient, focused, and determined in the face of challenges. These skills will help to prepare youngsters for life inside and outside the classroom.\n\nNoren contributed an eagle during his four tournament rounds and owes his triumph primarily to his consistency. He was the only player to record no more than 68 strokes (4 under par) in any round. The European Ryder Cup team's vice-captain showcased his outstanding form, having won the British Masters just three weeks ago. “It’s so many emotions right now. Sometimes it comes easy. Sometimes you’ve just got to fight. Today it felt like a fight,” said Noren. “This tournament is unbelievable, it‘s one of the best tournaments in the world and it gets better every year.“\n\nAt the 2025 BMW PGA Championship, the new all-electric BMW iX3 50 xDrive celebrated its UK premiere as the tournament's Hole-in-One prize. The Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) is the first model of the Neue Klasse and heralds a new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure. However, no player managed to score an ace on the 14th hole this week, which would have been rewarded with the new BMW iX3.\n\nThe eleven players of the European Ryder Cup team, who competed at the Wentworth Club alongside their captain Luke Donald (ENG), departed together for New York on Sunday to prepare for their title defense against Team USA. In addition to Noren, Viktor Hovland (NOR), Tyrrell Hatton, and Matt Fitzpatrick (both ENG, all -15, T5) also carry strong results into the event.

The enlarged \"DEUS\" logo dominates the design as a graphic element and becomes more than just a wordmark. The unconventional, playful handling of the brand presence is typical of DEUS and gives the MINI 24 Hours race car its visual identity this year. The reduced black and white color scheme ensures that additional elements such as starting numbers or team logos are harmoniously integrated into the overall image. Hand-drawn logos on windows and other surfaces underline the raw, conceptual character of the race car, making it appear like a \"moving sketchbook\". This is intended to suggest that the Nürburgring 24 Hours race car is just a foretaste. It is the perfect first milestone in the MINI x DEUS cooperation.\n\nFor the design of the race car livery, MINI Design collaborated with Designworks. The BMW Group subsidiary has elaborated the creative idea of DEUS in detail. \"Successful brand collaborations arise when partners inspire and drive each other forward. With DEUS, MINI and Designworks, we were able to unleash a remarkable design dynamic. The DEUS livery of the MINI John Cooper Works at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is just the first proof of this,\" says Holger Hampf, Head of MINI Design.\n\nMINI Continues Its Racing Heritage.With its appearance, MINI is continuing its long-standing racing heritage. The brand has been considered an underdog in motorsports from the very beginning - and yet it has written motorsport history. The 1964 Monte Carlo Rally became a shining moment for the British Outsider. With its transversely mounted front engine and front-wheel drive, the classic Mini was the epitome of a practical small car - and proved to be a successful race car thanks to the ingenious racing engineer John Cooper. The victory in the Monte Carlo Rally was not a mere whim of fate, but the result of meticulous work. This was followed by two more victories in the famous rally in 1965 and 1967. The tradition and passion for MINI's racing heritage is still palpable and tangible in the current models. The latest MINI John Cooper Works models are characterised by their aerodynamic precision and performance-oriented four-cylinder TwinPower Turbo petrol engine.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "MINI, John Cooper Works, MINI John Cooper Works, MINI Motorsport, Concept Vehicles, Design Studies"}]}

The 73rd edition of the Twelve Hours of Sebring (USA) this coming Saturday, 15th March, is all about a significant anniversary. BMW North America celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, and the endurance classic in Florida plays a special role in this history. The story of BMW North America began in 1975 with the victory of the BMW 3.0 CSL at Sebring. Accordingly, the two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL will compete from this season’s second race of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC) with a special anniversary livery.\n\n1975 was a historic year for BMW in North America. BMW North America was founded on 15th March, and just days later, the BMW 3.0 CSL secured the brand’s first major sports car victory in the USA at Sebring. This triumph came in the very first race that BMW Motorsport GmbH and the newly established BMW North America entered together. Exactly 50 years later, the BMW M Hybrid V8 livery at the Twelve Hours of Sebring pays tribute to half a century of motorsport success in North America. It showcases key milestones from 1975 to today, embedded within the track silhouette of Sebring. As witnesses of history, Jochen Neerpasch, co-founder and first managing director of BMW Motorsport GmbH, and Brian Redman (USA), Sebring winner of 1975, will be present for the anniversary. The BMW M Hybrid V8s will continue to feature these special liveries throughout the IWSC season.\n\nThe Twelve Hours of Sebring marks the second event of the 2025 IWSC season. At the endurance classic in Florida, BMW M Motorsport teams aim to extend the 50-year legacy of success.

Decorated with five driver and two team titles, BMW M Motorsport enters the DTM season 2025. Schubert Motorsport is aiming to defend their team title with two new BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars, as well as seeking their second driver's title since 2022. Behind the wheels of the two cars are three-time DTM champion René Rast and two-time title holder Marco Wittmann (both GER). The two BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars will sport the colours of BMW M Motorsport Premium Partners RoboMarkets and Schaeffler .\n\nBoth Rast and Wittmann remain loyal to their colours from previous seasons. Since his switch to BMW M Motorsport in the 2023 season, Rast has been starting in the blue and black of RoboMarkets. Wittmann's “Green Machine” from Schaeffler has been his trademark in the DTM since 2019. In 2024, Rast secured two victories, one second place, and one third place. Wittmann celebrated one victory and one third place. Schubert Motorsport achieved a total of four victories and three additional podium finishes on their way to the team title.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT3 EVO will also compete in the ADAC GT Masters, with both Schubert Motorsport and FK Performance Motorsport fielding the car. In the ADAC GT4 Germany, the BMW M4 GT4 EVO will have its debut season.\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “In the 2025 DTM season, we are once again strongly positioned with the reigning team champions from Schubert Motorsport and the two DTM stars René Rast and Marco Wittmann. Additionally, the EVO version of our BMW M4 GT3 has already proved its ability to win in its first races. We have created all the conditions necessary to compete for titles in both the drivers' and team standings in the upcoming season. That is our clear goal. We are also very well represented in the ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. We are excited about this strong presence of BMW M Motorsport at the DTM race weekends and aim to compete for victories and titles in all racing series and with all cars.”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “We are entering the new DTM season with great ambitions. Our clear goal is to fight for the title until the end – both in the drivers' and team standings. After 2022, we want to bring the drivers' title back to Oschersleben and at the same time successfully defend the team title from last year. We have already gained initial experience with the new BMW M4 GT3 EVO, but there are still some unknowns, especially concerning the new tyres. Even though we are starting with two cars this season, we are convinced that we are strongly positioned, and it is even more important for us to be at the front in every race and secure crucial points for the team standings. In parallel, we are pleased to be represented again in the ADAC GT Masters. The series is an important part of our history, and it's great to be involved again.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I am thrilled to be able to start again in the DTM with Schaeffler and the 'Green Machine' in 2025. In my second season with Schubert Motorsport, my goal is to fight for podium places and victories. If we manage to do this regularly, we can also have a say in the title race. Focusing on two cars certainly helps the team to concentrate its efforts even more. Additionally, we want to improve further compared to the past DTM season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “My goal for the upcoming DTM season is clear: I want to win my fourth drivers' title. Of course, we also want to be at the forefront in the team standings, but ultimately, winning the drivers' championship is of the highest importance – naturally for me personally, but also for the team. I haven't driven the BMW M4 GT3 EVO yet, but based on everything I've heard from my fellow drivers so far, I'm hoping for a leap forward.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Decorated with five driver and two team titles, BMW M Motorsport enters the DTM season 2025.

Additionally, the EVO version of our BMW M4 GT3 has already proved its ability to win in its first races. We have created all the conditions necessary to compete for titles in both the drivers' and team standings in the upcoming season. That is our clear goal. We are also very well represented in the ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. We are excited about this strong presence of BMW M Motorsport at the DTM race weekends and aim to compete for victories and titles in all racing series and with all cars.”\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “We are entering the new DTM season with great ambitions. Our clear goal is to fight for the title until the end – both in the drivers' and team standings. After 2022, we want to bring the drivers' title back to Oschersleben and at the same time successfully defend the team title from last year. We have already gained initial experience with the new BMW M4 GT3 EVO, but there are still some unknowns, especially concerning the new tyres. Even though we are starting with two cars this season, we are convinced that we are strongly positioned, and it is even more important for us to be at the front in every race and secure crucial points for the team standings. In parallel, we are pleased to be represented again in the ADAC GT Masters. The series is an important part of our history, and it's great to be involved again.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I am thrilled to be able to start again in the DTM with Schaeffler and the 'Green Machine' in 2025. In my second season with Schubert Motorsport, my goal is to fight for podium places and victories. If we manage to do this regularly, we can also have a say in the title race. Focusing on two cars certainly helps the team to concentrate its efforts even more. Additionally, we want to improve further compared to the past DTM season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “My goal for the upcoming DTM season is clear: I want to win my fourth drivers' title. Of course, we also want to be at the forefront in the team standings, but ultimately, winning the drivers' championship is of the highest importance – naturally for me personally, but also for the team.

In the countdown to the start of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship, BMW Motorrad Motorsport has completed an intensive double test session. Last week, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team hit the track in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, with Michael van der Mark (NED). This week, at the two-day test in Portimão, Portugal, reigning World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) also joined the team after skipping Jerez due to a finger injury.\n\nIn addition to poor weather conditions, changed regulations complicated the development process. Due to the FIM rule change effective January 23, 2025, against BMW, the Super-Concession frame used last year may no longer be deployed. Furthermore, the fuel flow limit of 47 kg/h forces all teams to adopt more efficient strategies. However, it wasn't just the technology that was tested – World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu battled with a broken finger yet still managed impressive lap times, while Michael van der Mark had to regain his form after a crash at Jerez. Despite all these challenges, BMW has created a strong foundation with the new M 1000 RR – the season can begin!\n\nThe BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team was also in action at both tests, with Sylvain Guintoli (FRA) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) riding the new BMW M 1000 RR. The test days were used for intensive set-up work on the new World Superbike, with close collaboration between the race and test teams in preparation for the title defense mission. The 2025 WorldSBK season kicks off from 21st to 23rd February in Phillip Island (AUS), with another two-day test scheduled there beforehand.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “To sum it up briefly, we are ready for Phillip Island. It was certainly not the easiest winter, especially with the rainy days and the limited dry track time. Nevertheless, on the first day at Portimão, we were able to show well where we stand. We are also very happy that Toprak’s injury is healing. He’s not at 100% yet, but he has already proved on track what potential he and the BMW will have this year again. On Mickey’s side, we were also very positive. His performance has remained strong over the winter, and we saw in Jerez that he will carry this momentum into Phillip Island. Now, we can hardly wait to head to Australia and start the first race.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It is always a pleasure to see the factory team and the test team together at the track, experiencing how the respective technicians and riders synchronise, exchange information, and collaboratively develop the 2025 bike. The test team has tested in all weather conditions, laid solid foundations, and secured and confirmed the final parts for the 2025 race deployment. Markus and Sylvain have diligently completed laps and all test assignments, even though Sylvain was slightly unwell at Portimão. Wishing him a speedy recovery at this point. The race team also maximised a dry day at Jerez with Michael and a few dry but very windy hours at Portimão on Day 1 with both deployment riders. Toprak confirmed the competitiveness of the bike for 2025 on race tyres in dry conditions and admirably completed his test programme despite his hand injury, totalling 60 valuable laps. During the two test events in Jerez and Portimão, we were thus able to confirm the performance of the M1000RR in dry conditions, sort out components, and adapt the bike to the new regulations for 2025. The bike, riders and technical crew are ready and highly motivated to start their journey with the new M1000RR to Australia, where two valuable test days await before the first race of the season to incorporate the final insights from the pre-season tests and complete the fine-tuning.”\n\nShaun Muir, Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At Jerez we obviously only tested with Michael and we’ve been happy with the situation with him in terms of the work he’s done with the test items. We’re really happy with the package so far. At Portimão we were mostly struggling to work around the weather situation, so what turned out to be very valuable track time was on day one in the afternoon. We certainly ticked a lot of boxes in terms of understanding the package now. For sure not knowing that day two would be so bad weather wise, at least now we have some clear direction going to Phillip Island, where we have a more comfortable feeling now starting the season there.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “For me the test in Portimão, especially the first day, was really positive. We tried some new parts and set-ups and it worked really well. I’m happy and it looks like that we’re ready for the Phillip Island race. The test was also very important for me after my injury; my finger was broken and I couldn’t ride a bike for almost two months, so I’m glad that I could ride the Superbike again. I have still a little pain in my finger but on the bike I’m feeling very good. The hard braking especially is good and normal, it’s only while I’m leaning in the right corner, I’m not feeling a hundred percent comfortable and I’m not pushing as hard as before. I hope that it will be better by Phillip Island because generally everything is going really well. I’m looking forward to the Phillip Island test now, I hope we can find a good set-up and to start the season strong.”\n\nMichael van der Mark (ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It was really nice to be back at the track after the winter break. We were just really unlucky with the weather during the two tests at Jerez and Portimão. Anyway, I think we started off on a very good level. For sure you always want to try new things on a bike, especially with a new bike as we have, but the level was already so good, so I’m feeling very confident and am looking forward to Phillip Island. We have another two days of testing there, so there will be still a lot of things that we want to try but we know that the basis is really good and we’re happy to race now. The new bike feels really similar to last years bike, but with certain improvements, which is really good, I like it a lot.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger (BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team): “Unfortunately, we didn't have the best weather during the pre-season tests, but that was the case for all teams and riders. The weather was quite mixed at both tests, and also relatively cool. Nevertheless, we tried our best to complete our test programme and rode many laps. We tried out various things and the engineers were satisfied with that. As a test rider, it's also important for me to contribute insights that the engineers and the team can work with effectively and that actually benefit the project, so my goal isn't necessarily to ride a fast lap. All in all, the tests were cool, we spent a lot of time together and collected a lot of data. I think we've done a good job preparing, so that the factory team now has a good base for Phillip Island, and I am very happy and grateful to be a part of it.”\n\nSylvain Guintoli (BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team): “I’m actually not feeling very well, so I only tested the first day at Portimão. I still managed to do more than 70 laps though but couldn’t test on day two. Anyways, in general the winter testing was good, we definitely had challenging weather conditions at Jerez and Portimão, but we did what we wanted to do. We were able to cover lots of mileage in both wet and dry conditions, which was really important so it was definitely also good practice for our Endurance season, especially for Le Mans. All in all we got everything done and I’m really happy with it. It feels good, that everything is now ready to go for the first round at Phillip Island.

This week, at the two-day test in Portimão, Portugal, reigning World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) also joined the team after skipping Jerez due to a finger injury.\n\nIn addition to poor weather conditions, changed regulations complicated the development process. Due to the FIM rule change effective January 23, 2025, against BMW, the Super-Concession frame used last year may no longer be deployed. Furthermore, the fuel flow limit of 47 kg/h forces all teams to adopt more efficient strategies. However, it wasn't just the technology that was tested – World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu battled with a broken finger yet still managed impressive lap times, while Michael van der Mark had to regain his form after a crash at Jerez. Despite all these challenges, BMW has created a strong foundation with the new M 1000 RR – the season can begin!\n\nThe BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team was also in action at both tests, with Sylvain Guintoli (FRA) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) riding the new BMW M 1000 RR. The test days were used for intensive set-up work on the new World Superbike, with close collaboration between the race and test teams in preparation for the title defense mission. The 2025 WorldSBK season kicks off from 21st to 23rd February in Phillip Island (AUS), with another two-day test scheduled there beforehand.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “To sum it up briefly, we are ready for Phillip Island. It was certainly not the easiest winter, especially with the rainy days and the limited dry track time. Nevertheless, on the first day at Portimão, we were able to show well where we stand. We are also very happy that Toprak’s injury is healing. He’s not at 100% yet, but he has already proved on track what potential he and the BMW will have this year again. On Mickey’s side, we were also very positive. His performance has remained strong over the winter, and we saw in Jerez that he will carry this momentum into Phillip Island. Now, we can hardly wait to head to Australia and start the first race.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It is always a pleasure to see the factory team and the test team together at the track, experiencing how the respective technicians and riders synchronise, exchange information, and collaboratively develop the 2025 bike. The test team has tested in all weather conditions, laid solid foundations, and secured and confirmed the final parts for the 2025 race deployment. Markus and Sylvain have diligently completed laps and all test assignments, even though Sylvain was slightly unwell at Portimão. Wishing him a speedy recovery at this point. The race team also maximised a dry day at Jerez with Michael and a few dry but very windy hours at Portimão on Day 1 with both deployment riders. Toprak confirmed the competitiveness of the bike for 2025 on race tyres in dry conditions and admirably completed his test programme despite his hand injury, totalling 60 valuable laps. During the two test events in Jerez and Portimão, we were thus able to confirm the performance of the M1000RR in dry conditions, sort out components, and adapt the bike to the new regulations for 2025. The bike, riders and technical crew are ready and highly motivated to start their journey with the new M1000RR to Australia, where two valuable test days await before the first race of the season to incorporate the final insights from the pre-season tests and complete the fine-tuning.”\n\nShaun Muir, Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At Jerez we obviously only tested with Michael and we’ve been happy with the situation with him in terms of the work he’s done with the test items. We’re really happy with the package so far. At Portimão we were mostly struggling to work around the weather situation, so what turned out to be very valuable track time was on day one in the afternoon. We certainly ticked a lot of boxes in terms of understanding the package now. For sure not knowing that day two would be so bad weather wise, at least now we have some clear direction going to Phillip Island, where we have a more comfortable feeling now starting the season there.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “For me the test in Portimão, especially the first day, was really positive. We tried some new parts and set-ups and it worked really well. I’m happy and it looks like that we’re ready for the Phillip Island race. The test was also very important for me after my injury; my finger was broken and I couldn’t ride a bike for almost two months, so I’m glad that I could ride the Superbike again. I have still a little pain in my finger but on the bike I’m feeling very good. The hard braking especially is good and normal, it’s only while I’m leaning in the right corner, I’m not feeling a hundred percent comfortable and I’m not pushing as hard as before. I hope that it will be better by Phillip Island because generally everything is going really well. I’m looking forward to the Phillip Island test now, I hope we can find a good set-up and to start the season strong.”\n\nMichael van der Mark (ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It was really nice to be back at the track after the winter break.

Here the BMW Group once again topped the rankings in 2024 as the best employer – for the thirteenth time in a row. A leading study in gauging employer attractiveness, the Trendence survey questioned 15,000 university-educated employees in Germany to ascertain the best employers for professionals. 2024 also saw the BMW Group top the tables in other global and market-specific employer rankings, such as the World’s Most Attractive Employers, by Universum, and the World’s Best Employers, by Forbes.\n\n\"You don't automatically become the best employer.

With a torque of up to 18,000 Newton metres, the \"fastest test rig in the world\" is the ultimate endurance test for the Heart of Joy and BMW Dynamic Performance Control developed entirely by BMW.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nMunich/Las Vegas. The BMW Group presents the driving and user experience of the future at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in Las Vegas. BMW is providing the first opportunity to experience the close-to-production version of the new BMW iDrive – complete with its centrepiece, BMW Panoramic Vision – at the event. The software underpinning it all is the new BMW Operating System X, which acts as the intelligence hub behind the new display and operating concept. The holistic system, with its modern, style-shaping design, will be introduced in all new BMW models from the end of 2025.“High tech meets highly intuitive operation – a quarter of a century of pioneering work and technological leadership in operating concepts has been channelled into the new BMW Panoramic iDrive,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development.“The foundations are provided by the new BMW Operating System X. With this advance, we are giving one of the world’s best and most comprehensive infotainment systems even greater capability and once again setting the industry benchmark in multimodal interaction. Starting with the first series-produced Neue Klasse model at the end of this year, the new BMW Panoramic iDrive will form an integral part of all future BMW models.”\n\nFour elements, one goal: consistent driver focus in characteristic BMW style.The new BMW iDrive merges four central elements into a unique display and operating concept.\n\nThe combination of these four elements re-interprets BMW’s customary “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach, with which BMW sets the benchmark for driver focus and presents a unique form of intuitive, use-friendly and ergonomically optimised operation. The BMW Panoramic iDrive always gives the driver the right information in the right place and at the right time. The system continues the approach of using an optimal combination of analogue and digital controls through the use of switches, buttons, touch and voice control. There are haptic switches for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selectors and window de-icers. Other functions are optimised for operation using touch/voice control or via the multifunction steering wheel, such as telephone functions, media control systems, navigation, assisted driving, personalisation of displays, selection of MyModes and much more besides.\n\nAlongside data-driven learnings on the use of BMW Operating Systems across the global fleet of now more than 22 million connected BMW vehicles, the development phase of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive also included numerous studies conducted in the BMW Group’s usability labs, in which around 3,000 customers were involved. Every decision on the various aspects of the operating logic is therefore based on data and made in a structured manner. Here, the user experience’s extended scope for personalisation has also been aligned with customer preferences and requirements.\n\nBMW Operating System X: intelligent, versatile, fit for the future.The new BMW Operating System X represents an update of the latest operating system, as used in many BMW models, and is a wholly in-house development from BMW. Like BMW Operating System 9, it is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. It offers even greater update and upgrade capability than the predecessor system, making it both fit for the future and backwards compatible. It is ready to accommodate additional functions and will keep vehicles equipped with the new BMW Panoramic iDrive at the cutting edge of technology over a long period of time. “The overall concept of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive with Operating System X has been enabled by a large technological leap forward,” says Stephan Durach Senior Vice President Connected Company BMW Group. “It offers intuitive operation, emotionally engaging experiences and specific personalisation. The new BMW iDrive with Operating System X demonstrates the potential of a software-defined vehicle.”\n\nThe expanded intelligence of BMW Operating System X makes it possible to combine the BMW Panoramic Vision, optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display, central display and multifunction steering wheel with one another in such a way that physical and digital experiences merge. For example, an incoming call initially brings up a graphic on the BMW Panoramic Vision. At the same time, a symbol on the relevant steering wheel button that was not previously visible is illuminated in green, indicating the option of taking the call by pressing the button or rejecting it with a swipe on the right-hand side of the steering wheel. When a navigation destination is entered by touch control or voice command, route guidance alerts are shown on the BMW 3D Head-Up Display and further information on roads and junctions on the BMW Panoramic Vision. A whole map overview can be shown on the central display at any time for broader-scale orientation.\n\nThe personalisation of content reaches a new level with BMW Operating System X. The displays in the Panoramic Vision can be adapted to personal preferences. In addition, drivers now also have the option of choosing their own settings for driving attributes such as response and steering characteristics in the My Mode “Personal”. Moreover, pictures chosen by the user can be uploaded as backgrounds for the Central Display and the colourway of the Ambient Lighting and user interface design adjusted to their particular preferences, creating an even more personalised driving experience.\n\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant responds in the accustomed way to the prompt “Hey BMW” or can be called up by pressing the respective button on the multifunction steering wheel. The capabilities of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant are being constantly enhanced and will be taken to a whole new level for the Neue Klasse through the integration of Large Language Models (LLM). The use of this technology is focused initially on navigation, allowing the customer to give more extensive spoken commands using natural language: for example: “Take me to a charging station which is close to a food store.” At technology partner Amazon’s booth at CES 2025, visitors can get an initial impression of these capabilities using a beta version of this build of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in a BMW X3.\n\nAs with the current infotainment systems from BMW, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant can – if the driver desires – make suggestions proactively based on user behaviour. This intelligence expands further with BMW Operating System X. In relevant situations, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant highlights driver assistance systems, which are rarely used by the driver. As a kind of reminder, the system suggests activating Sport Mode on suitable routes if the driver has already activated Sport Mode independently beforehand. If the driver doesn’t respond to or ignores these proactive suggestions several times, the system learns and refrains from making suggestions from then on.\n\nBMW Operating System X carries over the scope for integration of third-party apps from the previous infotainment generation. As things stand, the BMW ConnectedDrive Store offers more than 60 apps worldwide for BMW Operating System 9. The selection will continue to grow, e.g. with productivity apps such as video conferencing service Zoom.\n\nDesign and technology for a unique user and driving experience.The new BMW Panoramic iDrive is scalable and will be integrated into all new BMW models – across all vehicle segments and with all drive system technologies – from the end of 2025.\n\nThe driving experience takes centre stage. The driver should feel at ease and have full control over the vehicle. This principle is reflected in the design of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive. Particular attention is paid to the details: the user interface has been designed as intuitively and adaptively as possible to ensure seamless interaction. The result is a holistic experience enhanced by a harmonious combination of sound, light and innovative design. Every journey becomes a special moment of connection between human and vehicle. “Technology and customer preferences are changing more quickly than ever. The design of digital experiences and sound is playing an ever more important role,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. “The new BMW Panoramic iDrive not only makes our vehicles smarter and more user-friendly, it also enables much more extensive personalisation, which turns every new BMW into a car that is very much the user’s own.”Another element in the holistic experience provided by the BMW Panoramic iDrive is the new HypersonX sound experience in the Neue Klasse models. Developed by the BMW Group Sound Design Studio, it comprises 43 sound signals and special driving sounds for Personal Mode and Sport Mode. The multi-dimensional spectrum adapts the sounds precisely to the driving situation at hand and, in so doing, creates an emotional interaction between the driver and their BMW."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ The new display and operating concept will be introduced across all new BMW models from the end of 2025 +++ Consistent driver focus, information distribution and ergonomics +++ New BMW Operating System X provides intelligent software basis, ensuring extensive scope for personalisation and wide spread of digital functionality +++"}]}

The BMW Group presents the driving and user experience of the future at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in Las Vegas. BMW is providing the first opportunity to experience the close-to-production version of the new BMW iDrive – complete with its centrepiece, BMW Panoramic Vision – at the event. The software underpinning it all is the new BMW Operating System X, which acts as the intelligence hub behind the new display and operating concept. The holistic system, with its modern, style-shaping design, will be introduced in all new BMW models from the end of 2025.“High tech meets highly intuitive operation – a quarter of a century of pioneering work and technological leadership in operating concepts has been channelled into the new BMW Panoramic iDrive,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development.“The foundations are provided by the new BMW Operating System X. With this advance, we are giving one of the world’s best and most comprehensive infotainment systems even greater capability and once again setting the industry benchmark in multimodal interaction. Starting with the first series-produced Neue Klasse model at the end of this year, the new BMW Panoramic iDrive will form an integral part of all future BMW models.”\n\nFour elements, one goal: consistent driver focus in characteristic BMW style.The new BMW iDrive merges four central elements into a unique display and operating concept.\n\nThe combination of these four elements re-interprets BMW’s customary “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road” approach, with which BMW sets the benchmark for driver focus and presents a unique form of intuitive, use-friendly and ergonomically optimised operation. The BMW Panoramic iDrive always gives the driver the right information in the right place and at the right time. The system continues the approach of using an optimal combination of analogue and digital controls through the use of switches, buttons, touch and voice control. There are haptic switches for the windscreen wipers, turn signal indicators, exterior mirrors, volume control, gear selectors and window de-icers. Other functions are optimised for operation using touch/voice control or via the multifunction steering wheel, such as telephone functions, media control systems, navigation, assisted driving, personalisation of displays, selection of MyModes and much more besides.\n\nAlongside data-driven learnings on the use of BMW Operating Systems across the global fleet of now more than 22 million connected BMW vehicles, the development phase of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive also included numerous studies conducted in the BMW Group’s usability labs, in which around 3,000 customers were involved. Every decision on the various aspects of the operating logic is therefore based on data and made in a structured manner. Here, the user experience’s extended scope for personalisation has also been aligned with customer preferences and requirements.\n\nBMW Operating System X: intelligent, versatile, fit for the future.The new BMW Operating System X represents an update of the latest operating system, as used in many BMW models, and is a wholly in-house development from BMW. Like BMW Operating System 9, it is based on an Android Open Source Project (AOSP) software stack. It offers even greater update and upgrade capability than the predecessor system, making it both fit for the future and backwards compatible. It is ready to accommodate additional functions and will keep vehicles equipped with the new BMW Panoramic iDrive at the cutting edge of technology over a long period of time. “The overall concept of the new BMW Panoramic iDrive with Operating System X has been enabled by a large technological leap forward,” says Stephan Durach Senior Vice President Connected Company BMW Group. “It offers intuitive operation, emotionally engaging experiences and specific personalisation. The new BMW iDrive with Operating System X demonstrates the potential of a software-defined vehicle.”\n\nThe expanded intelligence of BMW Operating System X makes it possible to combine the BMW Panoramic Vision, optional BMW 3D Head-Up Display, central display and multifunction steering wheel with one another in such a way that physical and digital experiences merge. For example, an incoming call initially brings up a graphic on the BMW Panoramic Vision. At the same time, a symbol on the relevant steering wheel button that was not previously visible is illuminated in green, indicating the option of taking the call by pressing the button or rejecting it with a swipe on the right-hand side of the steering wheel. When a navigation destination is entered by touch control or voice command, route guidance alerts are shown on the BMW 3D Head-Up Display and further information on roads and junctions on the BMW Panoramic Vision. A whole map overview can be shown on the central display at any time for broader-scale orientation.\n\nThe personalisation of content reaches a new level with BMW Operating System X. The displays in the Panoramic Vision can be adapted to personal preferences. In addition, drivers now also have the option of choosing their own settings for driving attributes such as response and steering characteristics in the My Mode “Personal”. Moreover, pictures chosen by the user can be uploaded as backgrounds for the Central Display and the colourway of the Ambient Lighting and user interface design adjusted to their particular preferences, creating an even more personalised driving experience.\n\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant responds in the accustomed way to the prompt “Hey BMW” or can be called up by pressing the respective button on the multifunction steering wheel. The capabilities of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant are being constantly enhanced and will be taken to a whole new level for the Neue Klasse through the integration of Large Language Models (LLM). The use of this technology is focused initially on navigation, allowing the customer to give more extensive spoken commands using natural language: for example: “Take me to a charging station which is close to a food store.” At technology partner Amazon’s booth at CES 2025, visitors can get an initial impression of these capabilities using a beta version of this build of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in a BMW X3.\n\nAs with the current infotainment systems from BMW, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant can – if the driver desires – make suggestions proactively based on user behaviour. This intelligence expands further with BMW Operating System X. In relevant situations, the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant highlights driver assistance systems, which are rarely used by the driver. As a kind of reminder, the system suggests activating Sport Mode on suitable routes if the driver has already activated Sport Mode independently beforehand. If the driver doesn’t respond to or ignores these proactive suggestions several times, the system learns and refrains from making suggestions from then on.\n\nBMW Operating System X carries over the scope for integration of third-party apps from the previous infotainment generation.

In 2025, BMW celebrates 50 years of BMW Art Cars. To connect this legacy with the present, former Art Car juror Hans Ulrich Obrist and BMW have invited renowned artist Alvaro Barrington to transform the BMW Hydrogen VIP car fleet into a moving artwork during Art Basel in Basel 2025. This marks the second year in a row that the BMW iX5 Hydrogen fleet has been in operation at the art fair, following last year’s successful debut featuring the artwork of British artist Es Devlin.\n\nBMW has been Official Automotive Partner of Art Basel globally for over two decades, supporting creative voices that shape contemporary culture. Barrington was selected by curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, former member of the BMW Art Car jury, in line with the brand’s heritage of engaging with pioneering artistic perspectives. The resulting work, titled “Simply, 2025”, envelops the BMW iX5 Hydrogen fleet in Barrington’s distinctive visual language.\n\nAs a tribute to BMW’s pioneering work in innovative mobility, Barrington has reimagined the fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles with a striking wrap that reflects his signature collage aesthetic. Inspired by figures of cultural reinvention such as David Hockney, Richard Hamilton, Henri Matisse and Tina Turner, Barrington explores how mobility itself is evolving – not just in form, but in its emotional and cultural resonance.\n\nDrawing on in-depth conversations with BMW’s hydrogen engineers, Barrington’s concept bridges technology and humanity. Using a vivid palette and layered forms, his artwork expresses themes of transformation, nature, and technological innovation. The wrap fuses artistic vision with design precision, symbolising a future where mobility is not only sustainable but also emotionally intelligent and culturally integrated.\n\nAlvaro Barrington says: “Driving culture is one of the most important cultures in the world – billions of people participate in it. As an artist who is supposed to be involved in cultural production, it’s really interesting to be a part of this conversation about sustainability and the future of cars that BMW and the rest of the world is having.”\n\nAlvaro Barrington’s practice, rooted in painting but extending into multimedia and textiles, examines how materials carry cultural, political and personal histories. His BMW iX5 Hydrogen collaboration marks a significant moment in this journey, channelling his curiosity about the human-centric potential of technology and dynamic vision into motion through the medium of innovative transport in a joyful way.\n\nCentral to the collaboration is the BMW iX5 Hydrogen – a vehicle that showcases the brand’s pioneering role in innovative mobility and technology. As part of BMW’s presence at Art Basel in Basel 2025, the fleet will serve as the VIP car service alongside the fully electric BMW i7, reinforcing BMW’s commitment to contemporary luxury, innovation, and exclusive driving experiences.\n\n\"The collaboration with Alvaro Barrington amplifies our pioneering fuel-cell technology through the lens of art,\" says Michael Rath, Head of Hydrogen Vehicles, BMW Group. \"We are firmly committed to launching our first hydrogen-powered vehicle in 2028.\"\n\nFirst hydrogen-powered BMW production model in 2028.As part of its holistic approach and after the successful global testing of the pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles, BMW is now preparing to start the series production of vehicles with hydrogen drivetrain in 2028. The series production models will be integrated into BMW’s existing portfolio, i.e. BMW will offer an existing model in an additional hydrogen fuel cell drive system variant. As fuel cell technology is another electric vehicle technology, the BMW Group explicitly views it as complementing the drive technology used by battery electric vehicles (BEV) and next to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and internal combustion engines (ICE).\n\nThe BMW VIP car service fleet, featuring Barrington’s custom-wrapped BMW iX5 Hydrogen cars, can be seen on the streets of Basel during the fair, from 19 to 22 June 2025. The project affirms BMW’s position at the intersection of contemporary luxury, innovation, joy and artistic expression.\n\nEarlier this year, as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, BMW presented another artist-designed vehicle during the Market Art Fair in Stockholm. German artist Gregor Hildebrandt wrapped a fleet of fully electric BMW i5 and i7 models with his distinctive visual language, turning them into mobile artworks on the streets of the Swedish capital. Further artist collaborations and custom vehicle wraps are set to follow throughout the global tour.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 1,19 kg H2/100 km, CO2 emissions combined in WLTP cycle: 0 g/km.

As a result, he reduced his gap to championship leader Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) to just nine points. His teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) retired from race one, finished 12th in the Superpole Race on Sunday, and broke into the top ten with a 10th-place finish in race two. Misano hosted the sixth of twelve rounds this season. The championship continues from 11th to 13th July at Donington Park (GBR).\n\nReactions after the Misano round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an incredible weekend for the whole team. We have shown in recent races how we have fought our way back. To achieve the hat-trick here at Misano, especially after all the commotion surrounding Toprak’s move to MotoGP, is just an amazing feeling for the team. We’re very proud of what everyone has achieved. It was an indescribable weekend for us. On Mickey’s side, it was a tough weekend. I think he showed in the final race with a top ten result that he can also get towards the front. We’ll definitely keep working on that. All in all, BMW as a brand had the perfect showing here – we are incredibly proud and heading to Donington with our heads held high. We’re back in the title fight, and with Toprak’s current momentum, anything is possible. We will give it everything.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “The message sent this weekend is very clear: we have the best team here in the paddock, and we have the best team at the headquarters in Munich – this was an absolute team effort. Toprak delivered an outstanding performance, but to put the bike on top three times here at Misano – which is one of the most challenging tracks for us due to the thermal conditions and grip levels – and to set the fastest lap in each race is a complete team achievement. It showcases the strength of the BMW brand, the team, the rider, and the passion we all bring to the table. Unfortunately, the mechanics can’t refresh themselves with a well-deserved ice cream and cold drink just yet – they now have to completely strip down Toprak’s bike for a technical inspection. We’re looking ahead to the outcome with confidence and are already looking forward to Donington.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First I would like to say thanks to my team because they did an incredible job the whole weekend. We could improve the bike every session, especially for race two it was really good. I still had a small issue in corner four but anyway, I could manage it in the race. I had a strong pace and was pushing so hard because even though Bulega started from tenth position, I knew he will be fast and will catch up. So I had to push straight from the start. All in all I’m really happy – we did three wins as last year. Now I’m looking forward to the next races. The wins here made me even more motivated and I can’t wait to go to Donington now.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We’ve honestly struggled a lot this weekend. We’ve tried so many things with the bike, but it just never got any faster and I never got a good feeling, plus a couple of stupid crashes. Honestly, it was a big mess all in all. But of course, we’ve all tried as hard as we could, we never gave up but it was very difficult. Even race two, the feeling wasn’t there, but at least we’ve scored some good points. I’m not really happy with my weekend but I am really happy for everyone in the team who work non-stop. I’m looking forward to Donington now, we will be ready again.”\n\nAir temperature: 28°, track temperature: 40°, humidity: 60%, conditions: dry.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 30°, track temperature: 47°, humidity: 49%, conditions: dry, laps: 21.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 9, 1:33.201\n\nAir temperature: 29°, track temperature: 42°, humidity: 60%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:32.813\n\nAir temperature: 32°, track temperature: 48°, humidity: 54%, conditions: dry, laps: 21.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 6, 1:33.471\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R06/12, after 18 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R06/12, after 18 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "History repeats itself.

For more than 23 hours, BMW M Team RLL and Paul Miller Racing had their sights set on victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), but a dramatic final stage dashed all hopes of a well-deserved reward for a great performance by BMW M Motorsport at the season opener of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). Dries Vanthoor (BEL), who had secured pole position in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, collided with a competitor while fighting for second place and fell to fourth place due to the subsequent repairs. A similar fate befell Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, who was also contending for the win but ultimately had to settle for fourth position in the GTD-PRO class after an incident.\n\nDespite the disappointment over the frustrating final stage of the race, BMW M Motorsport looks back on a very strong race weekend at Daytona. Both the BMW M Hybrid V8 and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO demonstrated their enormous potential and made a significant impact on the track. Vanthoor, starting as the lead driver for the #24 from pole position – the first for BMW M Motorsport's LMDh project – built a 25-second lead in his first double-stint. Although this was levelled by numerous yellow flag periods, it underscored the strength of the vehicle. The same applies to the fastest race lap, which Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) drove in 1:35.868 minutes in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 which also showed impressive speed but fell back due to several incidents, finishing in seventh place. Both BMW M Hybrid V8s had no technical issues.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Paul Miller Racing played several leading roles. The #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO led the race into the evening but was then hit by an opponent in a mass collision. The heavily damaged vehicle was repaired thanks to the great efforts of the mechanics but lost many laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth place. The sister #1 car stepped up, moved up from its 13th starting position, and fought for the win until just before the end. Kelvin van der Linde had the podium in sight at his race debut for BMW M Motorsport until he was forced into a spin by an opponent and fell back to fourth place. In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport also gave a strong performance, finishing the race with the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in fifth place.\n\nYou can find video interviews with BMW M Motorsport head Andreas Roos and the BMW M factory drivers, as well as footage from Daytona for editorial use at the following link: \n\nComments after the 24h Daytona:\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"Of course we had hoped for a different outcome of the Daytona weekend. With 50 minutes left, we were in the fight for the win in all categories. Everyone could see how fast and reliable our car is. The drivers and the teams did a great job and made no mistakes. But that's racing.\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “A big thank you to the entire team. Unfortunately, we had a weekend of ups and downs. If we only look at the race results, we cannot be satisfied with the fourth places in the GTP and GTD PRO classes. We started the weekend well, achieving very good results in both the free practice sessions and in qualifying – with Dries Vanthoor on pole position (GTP) and Dan Harper in third place (GTD PRO). That was very promising. For much of the race, we were able to compete for class victories and even the overall win. That's the positive we want to take with us. When you fight for the top positions in a 24-hour race for so long though, it is ultimately sad and disappointing for the teams and drivers who have invested a lot of work to get there - it would have been deserved to win at least one, if not the winner's trophy. Nevertheless, we must take the positives: the strong trend from 2024 clearly continues, we were able to build on it and field a competitive car in the GTP class here. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also shown in its third race that it can compete against the toughest competition – also in IMSA.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “I want to say a massive congratulations to my brother. If there is someone who should win the race if it is not me then it is my brother. He has had a good time in the last couple of races and seasons and I am very happy for him. I for sure am very gutted with this result. We showed a great pace and that the car is capable of doing it. Obviously finishing in P4 in a 24 hour race is not the end of the world, but at the end of the day it is very sad to fight for 22 hours and not come home with a podium, which we for sure deserved. I feel sorry for the guys, who have been working very hard and also to my teammates. I would have loved to gift them with something, but most important is that we showed that we were strong and able to fight. We will make sure to come back and we will win this race.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 7th place): “It was a very disappointing ending to the race for us. We had a very good package to fight for the win, which we showed all week long so we were quite positive heading into the race. Unfortunately we had a small issue in the pit stop with the brake change. That cost us three laps and we never really manage to make it back again. Obviously that was not the reward we wanted to give all the guys for the hard work all over the winter trying to make sure we have a fast car that is able to fight for the win. But we will definitely take a lot of notes from the race weekend, try to improve for Sebring and really bring that podium home.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 4th place GTD PRO): “It is a proud moment for me, fighting the whole race for the win. It was a good mileage for me, learning the car for the first time. To narrowly have missed out on the win is more than I could have ever expected. It was unfortunate as we led the race for the last two hours. The last pit stop was where we unfortunately lost track position and we weren’t really able to overtake looking forward. The rest is history. We will come back and try again next time.”\n\nMax Hesse (# 48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO):\n\n“First of all, I would like to express a huge thank you to BMW M Motorsport and Paul Miller Racing. It was the first time I was able to start here. It's a very cool event and it remains my dream to win here someday. This year, we definitely had the package to do it. Unfortunately, we were involved in a big crash, which was not our fault. I was very well warned by my team, but unfortunately, our competitors behind us were not. That's part of it. Our car ran great. The mechanics did a top job getting us back on track. I think we've gained good experience for Sebring - and there we'll try to go full attack again.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO): “The situation with the Corvette and our sister car was very difficult. My intention was to support my teammate in the sister car in the fight for victory. I was aware that it was hard racing. The situation that led to the collision between the Corvette and Connor De Phillippi behind me was very unfortunate – but I had nothing to do with it directly. I stayed on my inside line.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT 3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 5th place GTD):\n\n“Looking solely at the result, fifth place for Turner Motorsport was the best 24-hour race at Daytona. On the other hand, we entered to win. Therefore, we are very frustrated. Half an hour before the end of the race, we were in second place and had done many things right up to that point. When you then finish in fifth place, at first glance you tend to see the negatives, but we gave it our all, and that was the maximum we could achieve with the overall package. I am still proud that after the BMW M4 GT3 was already capable of winning in its first two dress rehearsals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we also had the cars in the lead for a long time here and once again proved that the car has the potential to win races. This gives me a positive outlook; we will take this experience home, continue working, and then I think it will still be a very successful season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For more than 23 hours, BMW M Team RLL and Paul Miller Racing had their sights set on victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), but a dramatic final stage dashed all hopes of a well-deserved reward for a great performance by BMW M Motorsport at the season opener of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC)."}]}

When you fight for the top positions in a 24-hour race for so long though, it is ultimately sad and disappointing for the teams and drivers who have invested a lot of work to get there - it would have been deserved to win at least one, if not the winner's trophy. Nevertheless, we must take the positives: the strong trend from 2024 clearly continues, we were able to build on it and field a competitive car in the GTP class here. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also shown in its third race that it can compete against the toughest competition – also in IMSA.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “I want to say a massive congratulations to my brother. If there is someone who should win the race if it is not me then it is my brother. He has had a good time in the last couple of races and seasons and I am very happy for him. I for sure am very gutted with this result. We showed a great pace and that the car is capable of doing it. Obviously finishing in P4 in a 24 hour race is not the end of the world, but at the end of the day it is very sad to fight for 22 hours and not come home with a podium, which we for sure deserved. I feel sorry for the guys, who have been working very hard and also to my teammates. I would have loved to gift them with something, but most important is that we showed that we were strong and able to fight. We will make sure to come back and we will win this race.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 7th place): “It was a very disappointing ending to the race for us. We had a very good package to fight for the win, which we showed all week long so we were quite positive heading into the race. Unfortunately we had a small issue in the pit stop with the brake change. That cost us three laps and we never really manage to make it back again. Obviously that was not the reward we wanted to give all the guys for the hard work all over the winter trying to make sure we have a fast car that is able to fight for the win. But we will definitely take a lot of notes from the race weekend, try to improve for Sebring and really bring that podium home.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 4th place GTD PRO): “It is a proud moment for me, fighting the whole race for the win. It was a good mileage for me, learning the car for the first time. To narrowly have missed out on the win is more than I could have ever expected. It was unfortunate as we led the race for the last two hours. The last pit stop was where we unfortunately lost track position and we weren’t really able to overtake looking forward. The rest is history. We will come back and try again next time.”\n\nMax Hesse (# 48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO):\n\n“First of all, I would like to express a huge thank you to BMW M Motorsport and Paul Miller Racing. It was the first time I was able to start here. It's a very cool event and it remains my dream to win here someday. This year, we definitely had the package to do it. Unfortunately, we were involved in a big crash, which was not our fault. I was very well warned by my team, but unfortunately, our competitors behind us were not. That's part of it. Our car ran great. The mechanics did a top job getting us back on track. I think we've gained good experience for Sebring - and there we'll try to go full attack again.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO): “The situation with the Corvette and our sister car was very difficult. My intention was to support my teammate in the sister car in the fight for victory. I was aware that it was hard racing. The situation that led to the collision between the Corvette and Connor De Phillippi behind me was very unfortunate – but I had nothing to do with it directly. I stayed on my inside line.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT 3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 5th place GTD):\n\n“Looking solely at the result, fifth place for Turner Motorsport was the best 24-hour race at Daytona. On the other hand, we entered to win. Therefore, we are very frustrated. Half an hour before the end of the race, we were in second place and had done many things right up to that point. When you then finish in fifth place, at first glance you tend to see the negatives, but we gave it our all, and that was the maximum we could achieve with the overall package. I am still proud that after the BMW M4 GT3 was already capable of winning in its first two dress rehearsals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we also had the cars in the lead for a long time here and once again proved that the car has the potential to win races. This gives me a positive outlook; we will take this experience home, continue working, and then I think it will still be a very successful season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Construction of BMW Group’s new high-voltage battery assembly plant in the municipalities of Irlbach and Straßkirchen (Straubing-Bogen district) is progressing at high speed.\n\n“With the completion of the Energy Centre building and the fire station, we have reached the next important milestone on the road to serial production for the new generation 6 high-voltage batteries here in Lower Bavaria,” says Sabrina Kugler, Project Manager for Plant Construction Irlbach-Straßkirchen. “The Energy Centre supplies the new plant with all the essential utilities. In addition, there are around 3,000 square metres with optimal conditions for the fire department.”\n\nFor safety: Fire service on duty 24/7\n\nIn June, the BMW fire brigade began its around-the-clock duty on the BMW Group Irlbach-Straßkirchen site. With five service vehicles and 26 people working in shifts, the fire service will ensure the safety of employees at the site. The accreditation process as a plant fire brigade is currently underway.\n\nThe team comprises experienced colleagues from other BMW Group sites in Bavaria as well as newly trained plant firefighters recruited from the region. Two of the new employees are also active in the volunteer fire departments in Irlbach and Straßkirchen. Training events and exercises continue to be closely coordinated with the nearby municipal fire brigades.\n\nCentral control unit for all essential resources\n\nFor Silvia Meyer, Head of Real Estate Management at the Irlbach-Straßkirchen plant, the Energy Centre is the “heart” of the new high-voltage battery assembly plant. “Here future production and the ancillary buildings are supplied with all necessary media – electricity, cooling, heat, cooling water and compressed air.” The utility media are controlled in the so-called Operations Centre. The building’s heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting are controlled automatically and resource-efficiently via the energy control technology installed there. With the help of sensors, all key production facilities and rooms are continuously monitored and visualised in real time on the control room screens.\n\nWaste heat from production used for heating\n\nWaste heat from the production processes is used to heat the canteen, storage and ancillary buildings at low temperatures. To do this, heat pumps in the Energy Centre convert the roughly 23°C chilled water heated by the production plants into heating energy at about 60°C. Four heat pumps, each with 1.8 MW, guarantee fault-tolerant heating capacity.\n\nThe entire piping system of the Energy Centre extends over 3.8 kilometres and is initially filled with 500,000 litres of water. The production and assembly process for high-voltage batteries requires no water. Drinking water at the site is used only for kitchens and washbasins. Rainwater collected on the roofs is used for toilets.\n\nHighly automated production process requires compressed air\n\nThe highly automated material-handling technology in the production process for high-voltage batteries continuously requires compressed air. The energy center supplies compressed air at 6 bar to the systems in the production. Two redundant compressors cover base load, and a variable compressor covers peak load. The waste heat from the compressors is also fed into the cooling-water circuit and again available for heating the factory via the heat pumps.\n\nPlant runs exclusively on renewable electricity\n\nAlthough a natural gas pipeline runs across the site, the energy supply for the BMW Group Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen in regular operation relies entirely on non-fossil energy sources. The plant is not connected to the natural gas pipeline.\n\nAt the new site, electricity is generated from solar energy to cover part of the total power demand. A photovoltaic installation will be installed on a roof area of around 62,000 square metres. The extent is more than a third of the roof area of the future production building, i.e. about the size of nine football pitches. The PV system will be installed and operated by the energy supplier VERBUND. Construction will begin in spring 2026, allowing it to be commissioned in time for the start of serial production. Nearly 14,000 photovoltaic modules can deliver over 6 MW peak (MWp) and thus generate more than 6,000 MWh per year. Any additional external electricity required will come entirely from renewable sources.\n\nThe electrical supply of the assembly plant will be provided via underground 110 kV cables connected to a substation operated by Bayernwerk Netz GmbH in Irlbach, which is currently under construction. Until the substation is completed in 2028, a provisional 34 MW connection to the existing 110 kV high-voltage lines will ensure a stable power supply for the current construction site and the future production operation.\n\nIn addition, two own transformers with a maximum reference capacity of 68 MW have been installed on the site near the Energy Centre. They initially convert the 110 kV supply to 20 kV for distribution on the site. Transformers located close to consumption provide the 230 V and 400 V supplies.\n\nRadio mast secures mobile phone coverage\n\nThe Energy Centre also plays a key role in the plant’s mobile phone coverage: a radio mast on the roof of the Energy Centre provides mobile coverage for the outdoor areas of the site. Inside the plant, around 220 antennas have already been installed in various buildings, and more than 9.5 kilometres of RF cable and 3.5 kilometres of fibre optic cable have been laid to ensure coverage across the entire site.\n\nDigital planning tool BIM accelerates construction progress\n\nThe approximately 10,400 square metre building for the Energy Centre and Fire Station was completed in just under 14 months.\n\nA key contributor to this short construction period was Building Information Modelling (BIM), a digital planning method. BMW Group applies the BIM approach consistently in all planning and realisation processes for the new Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen. The system networks data and workflows of all project participants from planning through construction to operation.\n\nThe use of BIM ensures that all project participants have access to the current planning status. The method helps identify and optimise interfaces between all project participants at an early stage. An autonomous drone is used to continuously compare the current construction progress (as-built) with the digital building model (as-planned). Deviations are identified quickly so that corresponding measures can be taken. BIM is thus a fundamental component for a smooth commissioning, acceptance and handover (IAÜ process) of the buildings and systems.\n\nFurther information on the BMW Group plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen can be found on the project website –"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ BMW Group Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen: Energy Centre and Fire Station completed after only 14 months of construction +++ Supplies production and buildings with heat, cooling, compressed air and electricity +++ No use of fossil fuels +++ Fire brigade on site 24/7 for safety +++"}]}

At its meeting today, the Supervisory Board of BMW AG set the course for a continuity of succession at the head of its board. To this end, the Supervisory Board will put forward Dr. Nicolas Peter for election to the Supervisory Board of BMW AG at the 2025 Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board also expressed its support for the proposal that Peter — subject to his election to the Supervisory Board — be elected as Chairman of the Supervisory Board after the 2025 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe mandate of the current Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Dr.-Ing. Norbert Reithofer, as a member of the Supervisory Board will finish as planned at the end of the 2025 Annual General Meeting. He will not run for re-election after two terms of office. This also observes the standard age limit set by the Supervisory Board itself.\n\nNicolas Peter has extensive international experience in the automotive industry.

The hopes for a strong conclusion to the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) did not fully materialise for BMW M Motorsport. The season finale, the ‘8 Hours of Bahrain’ (BRN), proved challenging in both the Hypercar and LMGT3 categories. Over the course of eight hours, it was difficult to fight for the top positions. However, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) managed an impressive recovery drive in the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team WRT, moving up from 15th on the grid to finish eighth. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), retired in the final hour due to a defect.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, which had recently seen two consecutive podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars, the #31 car from The Bend Team WRT finished seventh in Bahrain. Behind the wheel were Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS). Valentino Rossi (ITA), Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) concluded their final FIA WEC race of the season in 15th position in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO entered by Team WRT.\n\nAmong the highlights of the 2025 FIA WEC season for BMW M Motorsport was a podium finish in the Hypercar class for the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at Imola (ITA). In the LMGT3 category, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved a total of four podium finishes: the #46 took second place at both Imola and Austin (USA), while the #31 finished third in Doha (QAT) and Fuji (JPN).\n\nThe day after the season finale traditionally features the FIA WEC Rookie Test in Bahrain. For BMW M Team WRT, BMW M works drivers Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts (BEL) – who this season have won titles in the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC) and GT World Challenge Europe, among other successes – will complete their first laps in the BMW M Hybrid V8. Sheldon van der Linde will set the reference laps. For him and Raffaele Marciello, however, the focus quickly shifts to their next challenge: both are travelling directly from Bahrain to Macau (CHN), where they will compete next weekend in the FIA GT World Cup with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs. Van der Linde will drive for Team WRT on the famous Guia street circuit, while Marciello will race with ROWE Racing.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The FIA WEC season finale with the eight-hour race in Bahrain turned out to be quite a turbulent weekend overall, both in the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes. In the end, the results were not what we had hoped for, as our clear goal was to fight for podium positions in both categories. Unfortunately, we simply lacked the pace in the race to do so. Nevertheless, we showed a strong performance towards the end, and the great battle of the #20 car for eighth place was a satisfying way to finish. Sadly, the #15 had to retire due to a loose right-rear wheel. In LMGT3, the #31 also achieved a top ten result with seventh place. Of course, our goal is to stand on the podium, but finishing in the top ten in both categories is still a solid achievement in such a fiercely competitive championship. Many thanks to Team WRT, who did an excellent job throughout the year in both classes. A big thank you as well to everyone at BMW M Motorsport for their hard work, and to all our partners for a great FIA WEC season. We will now carefully analyse everything and come back stronger next year. Congratulations to Ferrari for an incredible season – with their victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the manufacturers’ title in the FIA WEC, and the top three positions in the drivers’ championship. I think it’s fair to say it doesn’t get much better than that. At the same time, I would also like to thank Porsche, who are unfortunately leaving the FIA WEC at the end of this season. Thank you for the fantastic competition we shared – and all the best for the future!”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “Overall, it has been a disappointing weekend. We were hoping for a better result here. When you are starting the season the way we did, you expect something different, but unfortunately, it did not go that way. We have a lot of work ahead of us in the Hypercar class to improve for next year. In LMGT3, we just did what we could. We were unlucky with the last safety car, otherwise we would have fought for P5. But yes, we are not racing to fight for P5. I hope that next year we can fight at the very front.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 8th place): “Unfortunately, it was not the ending we hoped for this year. We would have liked to end the year on a high. There was so much potential at points in the season but we just didn‘t put it together as we had hoped. But at the same time we’ve learned a lot about the team and the car. I feel like we’re stronger than ever going into 2026. So the goal remains the same to try and be world champions next year, but we have a lot of work to do in the off-season. Now I am going to the FIA GT World Cup at Macau, where I want to end the year with a success – and it’s a great opportunity to achieve my goal to win a world title. But I’ve got some very tough competition, firstly with Lello as my fellow BMW driver in the ROWE car and then secondly all the other very competitive cars. So the goal is to try and win the race. I’ve been there on the podium last year so we want to go two steps better.”\n\nRaffele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “The season went differently to last year when we got stronger over the year. This year, we started strong but then it became difficult. After Le Mans, the season has been tough, to be honest. We will try to investigate what happened in the last races and we have some updates on the car, so hopefully this will give us a boost to be able to fight for something more. Next up is Macau, and that’s always a fantastic race. I won it twice, and last year, I nearly won it. So of course we are going there to try to win again. I’m pretty strong there, and so is Sheldon. So hopefully one of us can bring the victory home.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 7th place LMGT3 class): “It was a good race. When you see how difficult this race was for us last year and how big the step was that we made in terms of performance. I think that P5 or P6 would have been possible without the last safety car. So well done for the team, the step they did was pretty impressive.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 15th place LMGT3 class): “Unfortunately, my first WEC season with BMW was not as successful as we had hoped. There were some highlights with the podium finishes in Imola and Austin, but overall, we were always in a difficult position in terms of pace. We constantly had to fight our way from the back, and that was not ideal over the course of the season. However, even though things didn’t go perfectly in the FIA WEC, it was still a great first year with BMW overall.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Eighth and final round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship on the Bahrain International Circuit. +++ Hypercar class: The #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 from BMW M Team WRT finishes the eight-hour race in eighth place, while the #15 car retires in the final hour. +++ In the LMGT3 class, the two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs finish in seventh and 15th positions. +++"}]}

The hopes for a strong conclusion to the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) did not fully materialise for BMW M Motorsport. The season finale, the ‘8 Hours of Bahrain’ (BRN), proved challenging in both the Hypercar and LMGT3 categories. Over the course of eight hours, it was difficult to fight for the top positions. However, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) managed an impressive recovery drive in the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team WRT, moving up from 15th on the grid to finish eighth. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), retired in the final hour due to a defect.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, which had recently seen two consecutive podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars, the #31 car from The Bend Team WRT finished seventh in Bahrain. Behind the wheel were Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS). Valentino Rossi (ITA), Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) concluded their final FIA WEC race of the season in 15th position in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO entered by Team WRT.\n\nAmong the highlights of the 2025 FIA WEC season for BMW M Motorsport was a podium finish in the Hypercar class for the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at Imola (ITA). In the LMGT3 category, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved a total of four podium finishes: the #46 took second place at both Imola and Austin (USA), while the #31 finished third in Doha (QAT) and Fuji (JPN).\n\nThe day after the season finale traditionally features the FIA WEC Rookie Test in Bahrain. For BMW M Team WRT, BMW M works drivers Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts (BEL) – who this season have won titles in the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC) and GT World Challenge Europe, among other successes – will complete their first laps in the BMW M Hybrid V8. Sheldon van der Linde will set the reference laps. For him and Raffaele Marciello, however, the focus quickly shifts to their next challenge: both are travelling directly from Bahrain to Macau (CHN), where they will compete next weekend in the FIA GT World Cup with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs. Van der Linde will drive for Team WRT on the famous Guia street circuit, while Marciello will race with ROWE Racing.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The FIA WEC season finale with the eight-hour race in Bahrain turned out to be quite a turbulent weekend overall, both in the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes. In the end, the results were not what we had hoped for, as our clear goal was to fight for podium positions in both categories. Unfortunately, we simply lacked the pace in the race to do so. Nevertheless, we showed a strong performance towards the end, and the great battle of the #20 car for eighth place was a satisfying way to finish. Sadly, the #15 had to retire due to a loose right-rear wheel. In LMGT3, the #31 also achieved a top ten result with seventh place. Of course, our goal is to stand on the podium, but finishing in the top ten in both categories is still a solid achievement in such a fiercely competitive championship. Many thanks to Team WRT, who did an excellent job throughout the year in both classes. A big thank you as well to everyone at BMW M Motorsport for their hard work, and to all our partners for a great FIA WEC season. We will now carefully analyse everything and come back stronger next year. Congratulations to Ferrari for an incredible season – with their victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the manufacturers’ title in the FIA WEC, and the top three positions in the drivers’ championship. I think it’s fair to say it doesn’t get much better than that. At the same time, I would also like to thank Porsche, who are unfortunately leaving the FIA WEC at the end of this season. Thank you for the fantastic competition we shared – and all the best for the future!”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “Overall, it has been a disappointing weekend.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\n- Check against delivery –\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAt the BMW Group, we always focus on opportunities in the current market, as well as on our long-term success.\n\nWe ensure this by acting in a flexible, forward-looking manner.\n\nAfter the extraordinary challenges in the third quarter, we are looking ahead: In the fourth quarter, we are back on track for stronger earnings in order to achieve our annual targets, despite planned high upfront expenditures.\n\nWe continuously adapt to changes in our environment – without ever reacting rashly. We continue to steer our strategic course into the future, while avoiding short-term adjustments that could jeopardise our long-term success.\n\nOur commitment to technology openness has proven its value – and is paying off today more than ever.\n\nOur global positioning across sales, production and our supplier network secures us access to markets worldwide.\n\nBMW is a global company with a strong presence in all relevant economic regions. I regularly take the time to see this for myself. This doesn't work at a distance, but is best done when you are on the ground.\n\nSo, over the past three months, I have visited markets in all of our four sales regions – in Europe, the Americas, China and our emerging “Fourth Pillar Region”, which includes Southeast Asia and the Middle East, among others.\n\nOur global approach has often allowed us to compensate for fluctuating demand in individual markets. Of course, we are monitoring current developments in China very closely. The economic conditions there are challenging – and that applies to all market participants.\n\nHowever, it’s our ambition to perform better than our competitors, even in a challenging environment.\n\nThe key to this lies in our highly attractive product line-up. This enabled the BMW brand to deliver solid sales growth in Europe in the first nine months of the year.\n\nWith sales up by over 7 percent, we are significantly outperforming the total European market and expanding our market share.\n\nThere was particularly high demand\n\nand in France, with a gain of 14 percent.\n\nAnd the BMW brand is also growing in markets such as South Korea, Australia and India.\n\nGlobal demand for our high-margin models in the upper vehicle segments remains stable. The high-performance cars of BMW M reported sales growth of two percent in the year to the end of September. This month also sees the market launch of the latest M model many fans have been waiting for: the BMW M5 Touring*.\n\nWe are constantly expanding our product range across all drive variants in line with customer demand. Our highly flexible production network allows us to tap market potential.\n\nThis applies in particular to our all-electric models. In virtually every relevant segment, the BMW Group has at least one pure electric vehicle.\n\nAcross BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, customers have a choice of more than 15 different models. This means that the BMW Group has one of the broadest ranges of fully-electric vehicles among its competitors.\n\nSales in the first nine months of the year underscore the success of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy.\n\nWhile other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – are seeing a significant decrease in sales, battery-electric vehicles remain a growth driver for us in 2024.\n\nBy the end of September, we had sold almost 300,000 BEVs – an increase of more than 19 percent compared to the same period of last year. In the third quarter, battery-electric vehicles already accounted for 19 percent of the BMW Group’s total sales.\n\nThe BMW brand's fully-electric models performed particularly well in Europe – with sales climbing 36 percent in the first nine months.\n\nGlobally, BMW’s strong BEV portfolio fed growth in deliveries of more than 22 percent. The BMW i4* remains the brand's most popular electric vehicle.\n\nIt is closely followed by the BMW iX1*, which – like the BMW i7* – recorded double-digit growth. The first all-electric BMW iX2* is also on track for success following its market launch.\n\nThe new all-electric MINI models – led by the MINI Cooper SE* – are also being very well received. With a sales increase of 54 percent, MINI BEVs experienced highly dynamic growth in the third quarter. Starting this month, the all-electric MINI Aceman* will also be available in Europe.\n\nFor the first time, MINI is also electrifying its John Cooper Works variants. The MINI John Cooper Works Electric* and MINI John Cooper Works Aceman* celebrated their premiere at the Paris Motor Show.\n\nPerformance and driving dynamics are the clear focal point in both models. From January 2025 onwards, they will captivate even the most dedicated motorsport fans.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, we anticipate another significant increase in sales of fully and partially electrified vehicles. For that reason, we see no need to modify or delay the European Union's stricter CO2 fleet targets for 2025.\n\nWe have been working intensively to meet these new fleet targets for a very long time. We are therefore confident that we will also meet the stricter requirements for 2025, as we have consistently in the last years.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that a comprehensive and critical review of CO2 fleet legislation in the EU following 2025 is absolutely essential.\n\nWhat matters most is every tonne of CO2 we can save today – not sometime in the future. This is why the use of low-CO2 fuels, such as e-fuels, E25 or HVO100, should also be revisited. These fuels could immediately improve the carbon footprint of the more than 250 million vehicles already on roads in the EU.\n\nBy 2030, all-electric vehicles will account for more than 50 percent of our total sales. The rollout of our fully-electric NEUE KLASSE will play an important part in this.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is now entering the final straight – and we are keeping this forward-looking project on track. With a new design, the next generation of electric drives and a comprehensive digital experience, the NEUE KLASSE will set completely new standards.\n\nIn just under a year, the first series-production SAV model of the NEUE KLASSE will roll off the line at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary. This will soon be followed by a sporty sedan from our main plant in Munich.\n\nPreparations for the launch are progressing well:\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we will elevate our entire vehicle portfolio to a whole new level of innovation. This will be possible thanks to our use of technology clusters, which can be integrated into all future vehicles.\n\nIn this way, all our products will benefit from the technological leaps we will achieve with the NEUE KLASSE. This applies not only to our all-electric vehicles, but across all drive technologies.\n\nOur continued, systematic implementation of technology openness also ensures that we will continue to offer the latest ICE models in the coming years.\n\nIn 2028, we will introduce another element to our drive train portfolio: the BMW Group’s first series-produced fuel cell vehicle.\n\nHydrogen will play an increasingly important role in decarbonisation.

We are carefully adapting our approach to changing conditions and planning for a range of scenarios.\n\nWe continue to be guided by the developments we can realistically expect to see in different regions of the world.\n\nThe fourth quarter will demonstrate that our measures – despite all the ongoing challenges – yield positive results.

We continue to steer our strategic course into the future, while avoiding short-term adjustments that could jeopardise our long-term success.\n\nOur commitment to technology openness has proven its value – and is paying off today more than ever.\n\nOur global positioning across sales, production and our supplier network secures us access to markets worldwide.\n\nBMW is a global company with a strong presence in all relevant economic regions. I regularly take the time to see this for myself. This doesn't work at a distance, but is best done when you are on the ground.\n\nSo, over the past three months, I have visited markets in all of our four sales regions – in Europe, the Americas, China and our emerging “Fourth Pillar Region”, which includes Southeast Asia and the Middle East, among others.\n\nOur global approach has often allowed us to compensate for fluctuating demand in individual markets. Of course, we are monitoring current developments in China very closely. The economic conditions there are challenging – and that applies to all market participants.\n\nHowever, it’s our ambition to perform better than our competitors, even in a challenging environment.\n\nThe key to this lies in our highly attractive product line-up. This enabled the BMW brand to deliver solid sales growth in Europe in the first nine months of the year.\n\nWith sales up by over 7 percent, we are significantly outperforming the total European market and expanding our market share.\n\nThere was particularly high demand\n\nand in France, with a gain of 14 percent.\n\nAnd the BMW brand is also growing in markets such as South Korea, Australia and India.\n\nGlobal demand for our high-margin models in the upper vehicle segments remains stable. The high-performance cars of BMW M reported sales growth of two percent in the year to the end of September. This month also sees the market launch of the latest M model many fans have been waiting for: the BMW M5 Touring*.\n\nWe are constantly expanding our product range across all drive variants in line with customer demand. Our highly flexible production network allows us to tap market potential.\n\nThis applies in particular to our all-electric models. In virtually every relevant segment, the BMW Group has at least one pure electric vehicle.\n\nAcross BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, customers have a choice of more than 15 different models. This means that the BMW Group has one of the broadest ranges of fully-electric vehicles among its competitors.\n\nSales in the first nine months of the year underscore the success of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy.\n\nWhile other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – are seeing a significant decrease in sales, battery-electric vehicles remain a growth driver for us in 2024.\n\nBy the end of September, we had sold almost 300,000 BEVs – an increase of more than 19 percent compared to the same period of last year. In the third quarter, battery-electric vehicles already accounted for 19 percent of the BMW Group’s total sales.\n\nThe BMW brand's fully-electric models performed particularly well in Europe – with sales climbing 36 percent in the first nine months.\n\nGlobally, BMW’s strong BEV portfolio fed growth in deliveries of more than 22 percent. The BMW i4* remains the brand's most popular electric vehicle.\n\nIt is closely followed by the BMW iX1*, which – like the BMW i7* – recorded double-digit growth. The first all-electric BMW iX2* is also on track for success following its market launch.\n\nThe new all-electric MINI models – led by the MINI Cooper SE* – are also being very well received. With a sales increase of 54 percent, MINI BEVs experienced highly dynamic growth in the third quarter. Starting this month, the all-electric MINI Aceman* will also be available in Europe.\n\nFor the first time, MINI is also electrifying its John Cooper Works variants. The MINI John Cooper Works Electric* and MINI John Cooper Works Aceman* celebrated their premiere at the Paris Motor Show.\n\nPerformance and driving dynamics are the clear focal point in both models. From January 2025 onwards, they will captivate even the most dedicated motorsport fans.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, we anticipate another significant increase in sales of fully and partially electrified vehicles. For that reason, we see no need to modify or delay the European Union's stricter CO2 fleet targets for 2025.\n\nWe have been working intensively to meet these new fleet targets for a very long time. We are therefore confident that we will also meet the stricter requirements for 2025, as we have consistently in the last years.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that a comprehensive and critical review of CO2 fleet legislation in the EU following 2025 is absolutely essential.\n\nWhat matters most is every tonne of CO2 we can save today – not sometime in the future.

Identify the article type based on its content and structure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify the type of the following BMW news article.\n\nStatement Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Conference Call Quarterly Statement to 30 September 2024- Check against delivery –\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAt the BMW Group, we always focus on opportunities in the current market, as well as on our long-term success.\n\nWe ensure this by acting in a flexible, forward-looking manner.\n\nAfter the extraordinary challenges in the third quarter, we are looking ahead: In the fourth quarter, we are back on track for stronger earnings in order to achieve our annual targets, despite planned high upfront expenditures.\n\nWe continuously adapt to changes in our environment – without ever reacting rashly. We continue to steer our strategic course into the future, while avoiding short-term adjustments that could jeopardise our long-term success.\n\nOur commitment to technology openness has proven its value – and is paying off today more than ever.\n\nOur global positioning across sales, production and our supplier network secures us access to markets worldwide.\n\nBMW is a global company with a strong presence in all relevant economic regions. I regularly take the time to see this for myself. This doesn't work at a distance, but is best done when you are on the ground.\n\nSo, over the past three months, I have visited markets in all of our four sales regions – in Europe, the Americas, China and our emerging “Fourth Pillar Region”, which includes Southeast Asia and the Middle East, among others.\n\nOur global approach has often allowed us to compensate for fluctuating demand in individual markets. Of course, we are monitoring current developments in China very closely. The economic conditions there are challenging – and that applies to all market participants.\n\nHowever, it’s our ambition to perform better than our competitors, even in a challenging environment.\n\nThe key to this lies in our highly attractive product line-up. This enabled the BMW brand to deliver solid sales growth in Europe in the first nine months of the year.\n\nWith sales up by over 7 percent, we are significantly outperforming the total European market and expanding our market share.\n\nThere was particularly high demand\n\nand in France, with a gain of 14 percent.\n\nAnd the BMW brand is also growing in markets such as South Korea, Australia and India.\n\nGlobal demand for our high-margin models in the upper vehicle segments remains stable. The high-performance cars of BMW M reported sales growth of two percent in the year to the end of September. This month also sees the market launch of the latest M model many fans have been waiting for: the BMW M5 Touring*.\n\nWe are constantly expanding our product range across all drive variants in line with customer demand. Our highly flexible production network allows us to tap market potential.\n\nThis applies in particular to our all-electric models. In virtually every relevant segment, the BMW Group has at least one pure electric vehicle.\n\nAcross BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce, customers have a choice of more than 15 different models. This means that the BMW Group has one of the broadest ranges of fully-electric vehicles among its competitors.\n\nSales in the first nine months of the year underscore the success of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy.\n\nWhile other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – are seeing a significant decrease in sales, battery-electric vehicles remain a growth driver for us in 2024.\n\nBy the end of September, we had sold almost 300,000 BEVs – an increase of more than 19 percent compared to the same period of last year. In the third quarter, battery-electric vehicles already accounted for 19 percent of the BMW Group’s total sales.\n\nThe BMW brand's fully-electric models performed particularly well in Europe – with sales climbing 36 percent in the first nine months.\n\nGlobally, BMW’s strong BEV portfolio fed growth in deliveries of more than 22 percent. The BMW i4* remains the brand's most popular electric vehicle.\n\nIt is closely followed by the BMW iX1*, which – like the BMW i7* – recorded double-digit growth. The first all-electric BMW iX2* is also on track for success following its market launch.\n\nThe new all-electric MINI models – led by the MINI Cooper SE* – are also being very well received. With a sales increase of 54 percent, MINI BEVs experienced highly dynamic growth in the third quarter. Starting this month, the all-electric MINI Aceman* will also be available in Europe.\n\nFor the first time, MINI is also electrifying its John Cooper Works variants. The MINI John Cooper Works Electric* and MINI John Cooper Works Aceman* celebrated their premiere at the Paris Motor Show.\n\nPerformance and driving dynamics are the clear focal point in both models. From January 2025 onwards, they will captivate even the most dedicated motorsport fans.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, we anticipate another significant increase in sales of fully and partially electrified vehicles. For that reason, we see no need to modify or delay the European Union's stricter CO2 fleet targets for 2025.\n\nWe have been working intensively to meet these new fleet targets for a very long time. We are therefore confident that we will also meet the stricter requirements for 2025, as we have consistently in the last years.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that a comprehensive and critical review of CO2 fleet legislation in the EU following 2025 is absolutely essential.\n\nWhat matters most is every tonne of CO2 we can save today – not sometime in the future. This is why the use of low-CO2 fuels, such as e-fuels, E25 or HVO100, should also be revisited. These fuels could immediately improve the carbon footprint of the more than 250 million vehicles already on roads in the EU.\n\nBy 2030, all-electric vehicles will account for more than 50 percent of our total sales. The rollout of our fully-electric NEUE KLASSE will play an important part in this.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is now entering the final straight – and we are keeping this forward-looking project on track. With a new design, the next generation of electric drives and a comprehensive digital experience, the NEUE KLASSE will set completely new standards.\n\nIn just under a year, the first series-production SAV model of the NEUE KLASSE will roll off the line at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary. This will soon be followed by a sporty sedan from our main plant in Munich.\n\nPreparations for the launch are progressing well:\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we will elevate our entire vehicle portfolio to a whole new level of innovation. This will be possible thanks to our use of technology clusters, which can be integrated into all future vehicles.\n\nIn this way, all our products will benefit from the technological leaps we will achieve with the NEUE KLASSE. This applies not only to our all-electric vehicles, but across all drive technologies.\n\nOur continued, systematic implementation of technology openness also ensures that we will continue to offer the latest ICE models in the coming years.\n\nIn 2028, we will introduce another element to our drive train portfolio: the BMW Group’s first series-produced fuel cell vehicle.\n\nHydrogen will play an increasingly important role in decarbonisation. This makes vehicles with a fuel cell drive train a logical complement to established drive technologies.\n\nTo develop the new generation of fuel cell drive trains, we are deepening our long-standing cooperation with Toyota. We announced this in September together with Toyota CEO Koji Sato.\n\nThis collaboration also shares the goal of expanding infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling and electric vehicle charging.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe European automotive industry currently faces fundamentally different challenges from those we have faced in the past.\n\nWe are not dealing with a singular, overarching occurrence.\n\nInstead, we are facing a tangle of critical influencing factors that keep growing in number.\n\nIn such a phase, we do not need short-term incentives that only create a fleeting impact. What global companies truly need is a reliable and binding framework for progress and prosperity.\n\nThe introduction of tariffs on electric vehicles imported into the EU from China is just one example. Import duties do NOT make European manufacturers any more competitive.\n\nOn the contrary: They undermine the business models of companies that operate globally.\n\nAnd, since these tariffs mainly affect small electric cars built by European manufacturers, they could even impede the growth of e-mobility.\n\nMeasures like these are also inconsistent with the EU value of free trade. Free movement of goods is a key success factor for economic growth – not just within the European Union, but globally.\n\nFree trade remains a guiding principle for the BMW Group – and we will continue to advocate for it. Because protectionism always carries the risk that measures will provoke countermeasures – ultimately hurting everyone involved, rather than benefitting any of them.\n\nWe operate as a global player, making it all the more important to maintain our strategy of balanced global positioning. This applies as much to our sales and production network as to our selection of suppliers.\n\nWe continue to systematically expand our “local for local” approach – making our supply chains more resilient and improving our access to different market regions.\n\nAnd while Germany’s future as an industrial location may be questioned by some, we are making investments here.\n\nIn Irlbach-Straßkirchen in Bavaria, we are building a new assembly plant for the latest generation of high-voltage batteries. They will be used for the first time in the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nA total of five new assembly plants are under construction near our production sites worldwide, across all three major sales regions – Europe, the Americas and China.\n\nIn this way, we are already laying the foundation today for successful growth in the future.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis past quarter, we faced a series of extraordinary challenges.\n\nOne of the BMW Group’s biggest strengths is our ability to consistently find the right solutions and implement the necessary steps swiftly and efficiently.\n\nOur company maintains a robust global presence. Our strategic direction for the future is solid. We are carefully adapting our approach to changing conditions and planning for a range of scenarios.\n\nWe continue to be guided by the developments we can realistically expect to see in different regions of the world.\n\nThe fourth quarter will demonstrate that our measures – despite all the ongoing challenges – yield positive results. We therefore approach the final quarter of the current financial year with a sense of confidence.\n\nWe are striking a balance between securing short-term earnings and long-term success: This year, we are investing more than ever in new products, technologies and our plants, so that we can continue the BMW success story with the NEUE KLASSE from next year onwards.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Touring: energy consumption weighted combined: 27,6 kWh/100 km and 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery: G; weighted combined: B; fuel consumption with unloaded battery: 10,9 l/100 km (WLTP) BMW i4 eDrive40 Gran Coupé: energy consumption weighted combined: 18,6 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A BMW iX1 eDrive20: energy consumption weighted combined: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 474 km (WLTP); performance: 150 kW (204 PS) BMW i7 eDrive50: energy consumption weighted combined: 19,2 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 610 km (WLTP); performance: 335 kW (455 PS) BMW iX2 eDrive20: energy consumption weighted combined: 15,3 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: A; electrical range: 478 km (WLTP); performance: 150 kW (204 PS) MINI Cooper SE: energy consumption (NEFZ) in kWh/100km: – ; energy consumption (WLTP) in kWh/100km: 14,8 – 14,1; electrical range (WLTP) in km: 385 – 402.

Can artificial intelligence (AI) make quality control in vehicle production more efficient, faster and more reliable? A software solution developed at BMW Group Plant Regensburg as part of the “GenAI4Q” pilot project is making this a reality. At its core is an AI that delivers tailored inspection recommendations for the approximately 1,400 vehicles manufactured each day.\n\n“The use of artificial intelligence supports the digital transformation of BMW Group production towards an intelligently connected factory – for example, we are using AI for quality control in vehicle assembly. In this way, we are optimizing our production processes and creating added value for our products and, ultimately, for our customers” says Armin Ebner, head of BMW Group Plant Regensburg.\n\nBMW vehicles meet the highest standards of product quality. To ensure this, Plant Regensburg conducts numerous quality tests throughout the production process. Shortly before leaving the plant, vehicles undergo a final inspection: Trained specialists examine each finished vehicle once more to ensure it meets premium quality standards.\n\nA new vehicle rolls off the Regensburg assembly line every 57 seconds. Each vehicle is built to individual customer specifications for the global market. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on one production line – ranging from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models, as well as countless model and equipment variants. Virtually no two vehicles are alike. “Our AI tool generates an individual inspection catalogue for each specific customer vehicle,” explains Rüdiger Römich, responsible for Test Floor and Finish in Regensburg’s vehicle assembly.\n\nThe AI analyses vast amounts of data to create these custom specifications.

The BMW Art Car World Tour is set to arrive in Milan at the ADI Design Museum, marking a major milestone in the celebration of five decades of artistic innovation. From 4 December 2025 to 8 January 2026, visitors will have the opportunity to experience eight iconic BMW Art Cars designed by internationally renowned artists such as Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jeff Koons. Having previously travelled to Art Basel Hong Kong, Le Mans Classic in France, the Bridge in USA, Louwman Museum in the Netherlands, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix and over 45 further stops in more than 30 countries across the globe, the BMW Art Car World Tour will conclude this year in Milan before continuing on to Rétromobile in Paris in 2026.\n\nMassimiliano Di Silvestre, President of BMW Italia says: “Celebrating 50 years of the BMW Art Cars is truly a privilege and a great emotion for us, as it allows us to express our commitment to the world of art and design, which finds the perfect setting in Italy. Having eight cars on display at the ADI Museum in Milan also means hosting the exhibition with the highest number of BMW Art Cars featured in the 2025 world anniversary tour — a strong sign of our commitment and our desire to convey the brand’s values to enthusiasts, customers, media and partners.”\n\nThe Italian leg of the Art Car World Tour kicked off at the Concorso d'Eleganza 2025, where the Sandro Chia Art Car was exhibited alongside the entire BMW Art Car miniature collection. On 29 and 30 November, the tour continues at the Nanni Nember “House of BMW Brescia”, where three legendary BMW Art Cars will be on display together with the new BMW iX3, the first model of the “Neue Klasse”. Located in the heart of Milan, a global capital of fashion and design, the ADI Design Museum will provide the perfect setting to showcase eight vehicles from the world-renowned collection to close the year:\n\nADI Design Museum The ADI Design Museum in Milan celebrates both Italian and international creativity and innovation. Since 2021, it has showcased award-winning works that have shaped the history of industrial design and aesthetics.

Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enhanced by a vibrant array of events.\n\nThe BMW Art Car initiative was born in 1975 when French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, in collaboration with BMW’s then Head of Motorsport, Jochen Neerpasch, invited artist Alexander Calder to transform a car into a work of art. The result was a strikingly reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which not only became a visual masterpiece but also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, earning widespread acclaim. Over the years, the collection has grown to include contributions from legendary artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu, each bringing their unique vision and style to the project.\n\nFollowing the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection and the BMW 3 Series this year, car enthusiasts can look forward to another jubilee next year: 2026 will mark the 50th anniversary of Rétromobile, one of the world’s most prestigious automotive shows dedicated to the classic car sector.

Located in the heart of Milan, a global capital of fashion and design, the ADI Design Museum will provide the perfect setting to showcase eight vehicles from the world-renowned collection to close the year:\n\nADI Design Museum The ADI Design Museum in Milan celebrates both Italian and international creativity and innovation. Since 2021, it has showcased award-winning works that have shaped the history of industrial design and aesthetics. Located in the heart of the city, the museum occupies a repurposed industrial space that harmoniously blends historical architecture with contemporary style, offering an ideal setting for exhibitions exploring the intersection of art, innovation, and culture.\n\nCelebrating 50 Years: The BMW Art Car Collection Milan takes its place on the global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enhanced by a vibrant array of events.\n\nThe BMW Art Car initiative was born in 1975 when French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, in collaboration with BMW’s then Head of Motorsport, Jochen Neerpasch, invited artist Alexander Calder to transform a car into a work of art. The result was a strikingly reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which not only became a visual masterpiece but also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, earning widespread acclaim. Over the years, the collection has grown to include contributions from legendary artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu, each bringing their unique vision and style to the project.\n\nFollowing the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection and the BMW 3 Series this year, car enthusiasts can look forward to another jubilee next year: 2026 will mark the 50th anniversary of Rétromobile, one of the world’s most prestigious automotive shows dedicated to the classic car sector. To celebrate this milestone, BMW is bringing together all BMW Art Cars that have raced at Le Mans for a spectacular reunion in Paris early next year.
