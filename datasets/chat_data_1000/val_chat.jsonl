The start of the Endurance Cup season of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS could hardly have gone better from the perspective of BMW M Motorsport. The new BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved an overall victory, a class win, and a podium finish in every category at the 6 Hours of Paul Ricard at Le Castellet (FRA). The Team WRT trio of Charles Weerts, Ugo de Wilde (both BEL), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) celebrated their race win on the podium. In the Silver Cup, Paradine Competition drove the #992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO to victory, while car #991 finished second in the Bronze Cup. In the Gold Cup, AlManar Racing by Team WRT secured third place .\n\nThe #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO started the race from ninth position but steadily improved throughout the race. As darkness fell and the track cooled down, the car got faster, and about 1:45 hours before the end, van der Linde took the lead which he confidently maintained until the finish. The South African celebrated his second prestigious victory with Team WRT after the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS). It was also a particularly special triumph for Ugo de Wilde, as he managed to win right away in his debut as a BMW M works driver.\n\nThe Le Castellet race was a complete success for the BMW M Motorsport teams beyond the overall victory. Paradine Competition had double reason to celebrate. In the Silver Cup, the victory went to the #992 BMW M4 GT3 EVO driven by James Kellett, Charles Clark (both GBR), and Pedro Ebrahim (BRA). In the Bronze Cup, BMW M works driver Dan Harper, team owner Darren Leung (both GBR), and Sean Gelael (INA) in the #991 car finished second. In the Gold Cup, BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER), Ben Tuck (GBR), and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from AlManar Racing by Team WRT celebrated a third-place finish.\n\nROWE Racing, starting from 13th place with the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, made a strong comeback and finished the race in sixth place with drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI). Century Motorsport finished fifth in the Silver Cup with car #42. Team WRT's car #30 and BMW Italia Ceccato Racing's car #15 retired early.\n\nComments after the race.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to Team WRT on their opening victory in the GT World Challenge Europe! The drivers Charles Weerts, Kelvin van der Linde, and Ugo de Wilde can be very proud of their performances. Ugo de Wilde won his first race as a BMW M works driver right away – that's fantastic! Overall, our BMW M4 GT3 EVO made an excellent debut in this prestigious racing series. Many thanks to everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport and the teams that made these successes possible! We celebrated the overall win and a class victory, and stood on the podium with a crew in every class. Congratulations to Paradine Competition and AlManar Racing by Team WRT. Our record in Le Castellet is truly impressive.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am thrilled; it was a fantastic race for customer racing with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. This morning in qualifying, it didn't look like we would be going home with a podium in almost all classes. Jens Klingmann fought for the win in the Gold category until the end, and Darren Leung's team can be proud of their victory in the Silver class and second place in the Bronze category. All teams and drivers did a great job at the start of the GT World Challenge. I hope it continues like this.”\n\nVincent Vosse (WRT Team Principal): “Again, it was great teamwork! For a bit of history, we haven’t won here since 2012 and we’ve been close a few times but always a bit unlucky. To be able to achieve this strong result is mega. I’m super happy for Ugo who did his first race with us! It is such a nice way to start and to take off a little bit of pressure. I’m of course very sorry for car #30, those things happen in racing. Until then they were doing quite well. A great job from #777 with their 3rd place in Gold Cup. A great start of the season!”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1st place): “A very good weekend, I’m very happy! We didn’t expect it at all but it’s the kind of surprise we love to have. The team did an amazing job, our car was really nice to drive, so a big thank you to the team and to BMW M Motorsport but also my two teammates. First time we drove together, and we got a win straight away. Super proud and super happy to be driving with them. Let’s try to keep it going like we did and I’m sure we will have a successful year.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1st place): “It was a very surprising win for us. After qualifying our main target was to finish in the top-five and to score points, but to be fighting for a podium and even a win was unexpected and makes it even sweeter. Big shout out to Charles, he’s been really good. I think it’s one of hist best drives. Same for Ugo that we threw in a deep end in such a competitive championship, and he did really well. He made no mistakes, and he established him well this weekend. I’m looking forward to seeing how he progresses throughout the season.”\n\nUgo de Wilde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 1st place): “Round one is done, and I can’t believe what has just happened! It’s amazing to start my journey with BMW M Motorsport with a win. It was a really educational weekend for me, it was great to finally start racing with Charles, Kelvin and Team WRT. It was not easy at the start and we were not expecting to finish on the podium. We will keep working and try to focus on Monza then on the biggest one, 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Thanks a lot to BMW M Motorsport and to WRT!”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 6th place): “We had literally everything in this race. All kinds of possible things did not go our way but in the end we brought it home despite the issues that we had which was good. But for BMW M Motorsport it was an incredible weekend. The wins and podium finishes show how strong the EVO car is and we have enough reason to celebrate.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by Team WRT, 3rd place Gold Cup): “Super happy to kick off the season with a podium. I think the top-ten overall with our Gold Cup car is an amazing result. We didn’t have the pace in the end to fight for more even though we were so close to P2, but P1 was out of reach. I think we can be proud and happy with what we achieved tonight. We executed everything very well. The harmony in the team and in our driver crew is really good. I can’t wait for the rest of the season.”\n\nDarren Leung (Team Principal and driver Paradine Competition): “First race for our Silver car and the first time we were running two cars, so I am extremely happy that the first result is a class win. I am very proud of everyone involved. Unfortunately for the 991 we had three full course yellows that helped our competitors otherwise we could have won that, too. All in all todays results I think are a very good sign for the season to come.”\n\nDan Harper (#991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition, 2nd place Bronze Cup): “It was a challenging weekend from the start. We lacked a bit of pace at the beginning of the weekend. However, in the end, we had a brilliant race, securing a podium finish. We came close to a victory, but the full course yellow periods played in favour of our competitors. That's how it goes sometimes, but considering our practice sessions and qualifying performance, we can be very pleased with this podium result. Thank you to the whole Paradine team, they did a great job.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The start of the Endurance Cup season of the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS could hardly have gone better from the perspective of BMW M Motorsport.

I think the top-ten overall with our Gold Cup car is an amazing result. We didn’t have the pace in the end to fight for more even though we were so close to P2, but P1 was out of reach. I think we can be proud and happy with what we achieved tonight. We executed everything very well. The harmony in the team and in our driver crew is really good. I can’t wait for the rest of the season.”\n\nDarren Leung (Team Principal and driver Paradine Competition): “First race for our Silver car and the first time we were running two cars, so I am extremely happy that the first result is a class win. I am very proud of everyone involved. Unfortunately for the 991 we had three full course yellows that helped our competitors otherwise we could have won that, too. All in all todays results I think are a very good sign for the season to come.”\n\nDan Harper (#991 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paradine Competition, 2nd place Bronze Cup): “It was a challenging weekend from the start. We lacked a bit of pace at the beginning of the weekend. However, in the end, we had a brilliant race, securing a podium finish. We came close to a victory, but the full course yellow periods played in favour of our competitors. That's how it goes sometimes, but considering our practice sessions and qualifying performance, we can be very pleased with this podium result. Thank you to the whole Paradine team, they did a great job.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

BMW Group today announced the installation of the UK’s first “motionless” wind energy system at the MINI manufacturing plant in Oxford. Utilising Aeromine Technologies’ innovative, low-impact technology, the system harnesses wind power to produce clean energy without visible moving parts. BMW Group’s Oxford Plant will serve as a testbed for this cutting-edge technology, assessing its potential to enhance energy efficiency across BMW Group sites around the world, as well as commercial buildings in the UK.\n\nThis new innovative energy project is part of the BMW Startup Garage, a business unit dedicated to supporting early-stage startups working on cutting-edge technologies. It focuses on testing a functional product, at least in the form of a prototype, during a pilot project and commissioning the startup as a supplier at an early stage. Rather than acting as an investor through venture capital, the BMW Startup Garage is taking on the role of a customer, a “venture client”.\n\nAeromine Technologies has designed the wind energy unit, which is installed on the edge of a building, oriented towards the prevailing wind. The unit features wing-like vertical airfoils that create a vacuum effect, drawing air behind an internal propeller to generate clean electricity. Unlike traditional wind turbines, Aeromine’s bladeless design minimises noise and vibrations, ensuring no disturbance to buildings or the surrounding environment and with minimal impact on avian wildlife. Additionally, the unit is constructed from highly durable, recyclable materials, helping support BMW Group’s commitment to put sustainability at the centre of its strategic direction.\n\nCarmen Gargioni, Team Lead Innovation at BMW Group Real Estate Management, said: “BMW Group is always looking for innovative and efficient solutions in every aspect of the business. The BMW Startup Garage acts as a matchmaker between startups and different business units. New technologies are essential as we strive to find the most efficient solution to our requirements. This includes exciting innovations from new players.”\n\nThe new wind energy unit is designed to complement MINI Plant Oxford’s existing solar arrays across the buildings on site. The installation on the Body Shop has been in place for ten years and, when it was installed, was one of the largest roof-mounted solar farms in the UK with more than 11,000 panels covering an area the size of five football pitches. The solar panels generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of 850 households for a year. However, the solar panels are less effective during winter and evening hours, when wind conditions are often strongest – presenting an opportunity for Aeromine’s wind energy unit to step in and continue generating renewable energy.\n\nUrs Sambale, Project Manager for Sustainability Steering at BMW Group Real Estate Europe, said: “This pilot is a small but exciting project for BMW Group and complements our existing approach to purchasing renewable electricity from the national grid. We’re looking forward to seeing its potential for generating clean wind energy at BMW Group sites.”\n\nClaus Lønborg, Managing Director, Aeromine Technologies Inc., said:\n\n“Aeromine’s partnership with BMW Group represents a pivotal step in our mission to innovate and expand the capabilities of renewable energy solutions. Our “motionless” wind energy technology is designed to work seamlessly alongside solar systems, maximising the renewable energy output from rooftops while helping address challenges like noise, vibrations, and wildlife impact. We’re excited to see how this initial installation can lead to broader applications across BMW’s global facilities.”\n\nThe BMW Group has set itself clear targets for CO2 reduction up to 2030 throughout the entire lifecycle - from the supply chain, through production, to the end of the use phase - and is constantly seeking new ways to cut emissions including by exploring new innovations.\n\nIn 2023, the BMW Group sold over 2.55 million passenger vehicles and more than 209,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2023 was € 17.1 billion on revenues amounting to €155.5 billion. As of 31 December 2023, the BMW Group had a workforce of 154,950 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. The company set the course for the future at an early stage and consistently makes sustainability and efficient resource management central to its strategic direction, from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products.\n\nAbout the BMW Startup Garage\n\nThe BMW Startup Garage is the venture client unit of the BMW Group. It engages annually with over 1,000 startups across approximately 30 countries, seeking innovations that provide significant benefits to BMW Group's products, services, systems, and processes. This ensures early access to innovations, allowing BMW to shape them before they reach market readiness. Simultaneously, startups gain valuable insights into automotive processes, build networks within the company, and receive support in developing their business plans. The program aims to evaluate startups and enable them as long-term partners for the BMW Group, thereby strengthening the company's leadership in innovation. The Startup Garage is represented worldwide at all BMW Tech Office locations: Munich, Mountain View, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, and since 2020, Tel Aviv.\n\nAbout Aeromine Technologies\n\nAeromine Technologies has developed a breakthrough scalable renewable energy solution that harnesses the power of wind in an efficient system.

BMW Group today announced the installation of the UK’s first “motionless” wind energy system at the MINI manufacturing plant in Oxford. Utilising Aeromine Technologies’ innovative, low-impact technology, the system harnesses wind power to produce clean energy without visible moving parts. BMW Group’s Oxford Plant will serve as a testbed for this cutting-edge technology, assessing its potential to enhance energy efficiency across BMW Group sites around the world, as well as commercial buildings in the UK.\n\nThis new innovative energy project is part of the BMW Startup Garage, a business unit dedicated to supporting early-stage startups working on cutting-edge technologies. It focuses on testing a functional product, at least in the form of a prototype, during a pilot project and commissioning the startup as a supplier at an early stage. Rather than acting as an investor through venture capital, the BMW Startup Garage is taking on the role of a customer, a “venture client”.\n\nAeromine Technologies has designed the wind energy unit, which is installed on the edge of a building, oriented towards the prevailing wind. The unit features wing-like vertical airfoils that create a vacuum effect, drawing air behind an internal propeller to generate clean electricity. Unlike traditional wind turbines, Aeromine’s bladeless design minimises noise and vibrations, ensuring no disturbance to buildings or the surrounding environment and with minimal impact on avian wildlife. Additionally, the unit is constructed from highly durable, recyclable materials, helping support BMW Group’s commitment to put sustainability at the centre of its strategic direction.\n\nCarmen Gargioni, Team Lead Innovation at BMW Group Real Estate Management, said: “BMW Group is always looking for innovative and efficient solutions in every aspect of the business. The BMW Startup Garage acts as a matchmaker between startups and different business units. New technologies are essential as we strive to find the most efficient solution to our requirements. This includes exciting innovations from new players.”\n\nThe new wind energy unit is designed to complement MINI Plant Oxford’s existing solar arrays across the buildings on site. The installation on the Body Shop has been in place for ten years and, when it was installed, was one of the largest roof-mounted solar farms in the UK with more than 11,000 panels covering an area the size of five football pitches. The solar panels generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of 850 households for a year. However, the solar panels are less effective during winter and evening hours, when wind conditions are often strongest – presenting an opportunity for Aeromine’s wind energy unit to step in and continue generating renewable energy.\n\nUrs Sambale, Project Manager for Sustainability Steering at BMW Group Real Estate Europe, said: “This pilot is a small but exciting project for BMW Group and complements our existing approach to purchasing renewable electricity from the national grid. We’re looking forward to seeing its potential for generating clean wind energy at BMW Group sites.”\n\nClaus Lønborg, Managing Director, Aeromine Technologies Inc., said:\n\n“Aeromine’s partnership with BMW Group represents a pivotal step in our mission to innovate and expand the capabilities of renewable energy solutions. Our “motionless” wind energy technology is designed to work seamlessly alongside solar systems, maximising the renewable energy output from rooftops while helping address challenges like noise, vibrations, and wildlife impact. We’re excited to see how this initial installation can lead to broader applications across BMW’s global facilities.”\n\nThe BMW Group has set itself clear targets for CO2 reduction up to 2030 throughout the entire lifecycle - from the supply chain, through production, to the end of the use phase - and is constantly seeking new ways to cut emissions including by exploring new innovations.\n\nIn 2023, the BMW Group sold over 2.55 million passenger vehicles and more than 209,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2023 was € 17.1 billion on revenues amounting to €155.5 billion. As of 31 December 2023, the BMW Group had a workforce of 154,950 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. The company set the course for the future at an early stage and consistently makes sustainability and efficient resource management central to its strategic direction, from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products.\n\nAbout the BMW Startup Garage\n\nThe BMW Startup Garage is the venture client unit of the BMW Group. It engages annually with over 1,000 startups across approximately 30 countries, seeking innovations that provide significant benefits to BMW Group's products, services, systems, and processes. This ensures early access to innovations, allowing BMW to shape them before they reach market readiness.

Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team continued his impressive performance on the BMW M 1000 RR at the fifth round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Following a perfect weekend at Misano (ITA), ‘El Turco’ was again the benchmark at Donington Park (GBR). Starting from pole position, he won all three races in Great Britain, each with a significant lead, and set several new lap records. With nine wins to his name this season now, including seven consecutive victories, Razgatlioglu extended his lead in the rider’s championship to 41 points. In the Manufacturer’s Championship, BMW reduced the gap to leader Ducati to just six points. Scott Redding (GBR) from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team also had a strong weekend, starting from third place and finishing fourth in two races at his home round.\n\nAfter setting the fastest times in Friday’s practice sessions, Razgatlioglu set a new all-time lap record in Saturday morning’s Superpole qualification. He was over half a second faster than the rest of the field, securing his third pole position of the season. The first race turned into a showcase performance. Razgatlioglu pulled away from the field right from the start, extending his lead with each lap, setting a new lap record, and finishing more than eleven seconds ahead after 23 laps. The next win followed in the Superpole race on Sunday morning. Although Razgatlioglu fell to second place at the start, he regained the lead by the third lap. He pulled away from the field again, beat his previous day’s lap record, and won with a near five-second lead after ten laps. The second main race on Sunday afternoon was the final challenge. Razgatlioglu again pulled away from the start, set another new lap record, and finished eight seconds ahead as the winner.\n\nLocal hero Redding also shone at his home race. Already strong in practice, he secured the third start position in Superpole. In the first race, he held second place for a long time and fought for the podium before a technical issue forced him to retire a few laps before the end. In the Superpole Race, Redding seized his next opportunity. After a hectic start, he was in sixth place, and with determined manoeuvres, he fought his way forward. With a fourth-place finish, he and his team had cause to celebrate. In the second main race, he confirmed his strong performance and again finished in an excellent fourth place.\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED) from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team secured a place on the second row with sixth place in Superpole. In the first race, he lost positions at the start and finished ninth. In the Superpole race and the second main race, van der Mark finished twelfth. Garrett Gerloff (USA) from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team started the weekend from 12th place. He finished the first race in 14th place, the same position he achieved in the Superpole race. In the second main race, he finished 13th.\n\nAlso present at Donington Park were other members of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family, including BMW Motorrad factory rider Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), the 2014 Superbike World Champion, who presented Razgatlioglu with the winner’s trophy after the Superpole race, and Davey Todd (GBR), who won the Superstock race and the prestigious Senior TT on the Isle of Man with the BMW M 1000 RR in June.\n\nThe WorldSBK continues without a break. The sixth event of the season is scheduled for next weekend (19th to 21st July) at Most, Czech Republic.\n\nReactions after the Donington Park round.\n\nMarc Bongers, Sporting Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an amazing weekend. The second consecutive triple, with pole position and lap records, is just fantastic. I‘m still a bit lost for words. I think I need to sleep on it before I can truly grasp it. It was also great to see Scott up there, proving that not just one BMW M 1000 RR can compete at the front. This shows that the whole package is good. It was unfortunate for Mickey and Garrett. They didn’t get into the rhythm we had expected but we’ll keep working on it so that they can also fight for the top spots. Overall, it’s wonderful to be heading home with a case full of trophies. Before the weekend, I told the guys in the office to make some extra space in our cabinet just in case we brought back more trophies. That it turned out to be so many is a dream come true. At the start of the season, we couldn’t have imagined this. The goal back then was to win multiple times but now, leaving with over a 40-point lead in the championship changes the target of course. The new goal is clearly the world championship. We just need to stay focused, keep everything stable, and make sure we don’t make any mistakes but I’m optimistic, things can continue like this, and I’m already looking forward to Most. Our package now works on every track, so we don’t need to make many adjustments. I expect that we can be at the front at Most right away, especially since this is a special track for our package and our rider.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 1 / R01: 1 / SP Race: 1 / R02: 1): “I am feeling incredible now because before I came here, I had the target to get three wins, as this is my favourite track, and finally we did that here. This is team work and the team is working really hard. We improved the bike every session. I am strong but my BMW M 1000 RR was also working incredibly on this circuit. With my BMW I am really stronger here. The bike is working, easy stopping, easy turning. The grip is not 100 percent but the bike is helping me to show my potential. We are happy, because at Misano we had three wins and we repeated that here. Now I hope that we will also win at Most because I love the track there. Thanks to everyone, I am really happy today. Now we will see how the next round will go but we are coming closer to the world championship title step by step. Let’s wait, there are many more races to go.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 3 / R01: DNF / SP Race: 4 / R02: 4): “It has been good. I am a little bit upset with my start in the Superpole race because I cost myself a podium. I had the pace to be there but the Superpole race is quick and the start is important but it was like it was and I managed to come through which was good. Then in race two I knew it was going to be hard, I was also using the SC-0 tyre that didn’t feel so good yesterday. I felt better with the tyre so I was able to ride in a better way and this was good for me mentally to gain confidence with the package and to feel comfortable and relaxed on the bike more. This weekend has been good for me and for the team. Everyone has been working really hard, from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, from BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and it’s nice when you can put something together and give back a little bit. I wanted it too hard to have the podium but a step at the time and I hope next time we can make two steps more. For Most, if I have the feeling like this weekend as a start, I would like to be fighting again in the top five there. It’s a track that I like and a track I go well so a podium, without being greedy, is something I want to achieve. We just need to perfect the bike a little bit and it will allow me to do that.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 6 / R01: 9 / SP Race: 12 / R02: 12): “For today, we changed quite a lot on the bike compared to yesterday and this morning, I was feeling alright so we were ready for the race. In the Superpole race, I had an okay start but I just did not have the right pace to fight with the other guys. It was a shame to lose the sixth position on the grid for race two, but anyway, starting from 11th, I had a good start but on the first laps I was a bit in trouble with the other riders. Then I had an okay pace but I wasn’t fast enough. It was hard to fight with other riders, I could not really catch the group in front of me. In the end, I had a nice battle but fighting for P11 is not where we want to be. We need to find out why I don’t have the right speed at the moment. Let’s analyse and be ready for the next weekend at Most.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 11 / R01: 14 / SP Race: 14 / R02: 13): “For sure, this weekend has been a tough one. I came here with high expectations and the results we have seen here have shown what the bike is capable of. Congrats to Toprak to his wins and to Scott on his strong results, but for whatever reason we could not bring it together for me. We worked hard and tried a lot but the field is so close that even with a really strong pace and good feeling in qualifying I had to settle with 12th on the grid. From there, it is not easy to get strong race results. I am disappointed because more would have been possible. But we keep our heads down, regroup and get ready for Most, where the goal is to turn the page.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Donington Park.

Garrett Gerloff (USA) from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team started the weekend from 12th place. He finished the first race in 14th place, the same position he achieved in the Superpole race. In the second main race, he finished 13th.\n\nAlso present at Donington Park were other members of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family, including BMW Motorrad factory rider Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), the 2014 Superbike World Champion, who presented Razgatlioglu with the winner’s trophy after the Superpole race, and Davey Todd (GBR), who won the Superstock race and the prestigious Senior TT on the Isle of Man with the BMW M 1000 RR in June.\n\nThe WorldSBK continues without a break. The sixth event of the season is scheduled for next weekend (19th to 21st July) at Most, Czech Republic.\n\nReactions after the Donington Park round.\n\nMarc Bongers, Sporting Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an amazing weekend. The second consecutive triple, with pole position and lap records, is just fantastic. I‘m still a bit lost for words. I think I need to sleep on it before I can truly grasp it. It was also great to see Scott up there, proving that not just one BMW M 1000 RR can compete at the front. This shows that the whole package is good. It was unfortunate for Mickey and Garrett. They didn’t get into the rhythm we had expected but we’ll keep working on it so that they can also fight for the top spots. Overall, it’s wonderful to be heading home with a case full of trophies. Before the weekend, I told the guys in the office to make some extra space in our cabinet just in case we brought back more trophies. That it turned out to be so many is a dream come true. At the start of the season, we couldn’t have imagined this. The goal back then was to win multiple times but now, leaving with over a 40-point lead in the championship changes the target of course. The new goal is clearly the world championship. We just need to stay focused, keep everything stable, and make sure we don’t make any mistakes but I’m optimistic, things can continue like this, and I’m already looking forward to Most. Our package now works on every track, so we don’t need to make many adjustments. I expect that we can be at the front at Most right away, especially since this is a special track for our package and our rider.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 1 / R01: 1 / SP Race: 1 / R02: 1): “I am feeling incredible now because before I came here, I had the target to get three wins, as this is my favourite track, and finally we did that here. This is team work and the team is working really hard. We improved the bike every session. I am strong but my BMW M 1000 RR was also working incredibly on this circuit. With my BMW I am really stronger here. The bike is working, easy stopping, easy turning. The grip is not 100 percent but the bike is helping me to show my potential. We are happy, because at Misano we had three wins and we repeated that here. Now I hope that we will also win at Most because I love the track there. Thanks to everyone, I am really happy today. Now we will see how the next round will go but we are coming closer to the world championship title step by step. Let’s wait, there are many more races to go.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 3 / R01: DNF / SP Race: 4 / R02: 4): “It has been good. I am a little bit upset with my start in the Superpole race because I cost myself a podium. I had the pace to be there but the Superpole race is quick and the start is important but it was like it was and I managed to come through which was good. Then in race two I knew it was going to be hard, I was also using the SC-0 tyre that didn’t feel so good yesterday. I felt better with the tyre so I was able to ride in a better way and this was good for me mentally to gain confidence with the package and to feel comfortable and relaxed on the bike more. This weekend has been good for me and for the team. Everyone has been working really hard, from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, from BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and it’s nice when you can put something together and give back a little bit. I wanted it too hard to have the podium but a step at the time and I hope next time we can make two steps more. For Most, if I have the feeling like this weekend as a start, I would like to be fighting again in the top five there. It’s a track that I like and a track I go well so a podium, without being greedy, is something I want to achieve. We just need to perfect the bike a little bit and it will allow me to do that.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 6 / R01: 9 / SP Race: 12 / R02: 12): “For today, we changed quite a lot on the bike compared to yesterday and this morning, I was feeling alright so we were ready for the race. In the Superpole race, I had an okay start but I just did not have the right pace to fight with the other guys. It was a shame to lose the sixth position on the grid for race two, but anyway, starting from 11th, I had a good start but on the first laps I was a bit in trouble with the other riders. Then I had an okay pace but I wasn’t fast enough. It was hard to fight with other riders, I could not really catch the group in front of me. In the end, I had a nice battle but fighting for P11 is not where we want to be. We need to find out why I don’t have the right speed at the moment. Let’s analyse and be ready for the next weekend at Most.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 11 / R01: 14 / SP Race: 14 / R02: 13): “For sure, this weekend has been a tough one. I came here with high expectations and the results we have seen here have shown what the bike is capable of. Congrats to Toprak to his wins and to Scott on his strong results, but for whatever reason we could not bring it together for me. We worked hard and tried a lot but the field is so close that even with a really strong pace and good feeling in qualifying I had to settle with 12th on the grid. From there, it is not easy to get strong race results. I am disappointed because more would have been possible. But we keep our heads down, regroup and get ready for Most, where the goal is to turn the page.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pole position, three more wins, and new records: Toprak Razgatlioglu is the benchmark with the BMW M 1000 RR at Donington Park."}]}

With nine wins to his name this season now, including seven consecutive victories, Razgatlioglu extended his lead in the rider’s championship to 41 points. In the Manufacturer’s Championship, BMW reduced the gap to leader Ducati to just six points. Scott Redding (GBR) from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team also had a strong weekend, starting from third place and finishing fourth in two races at his home round.\n\nAfter setting the fastest times in Friday’s practice sessions, Razgatlioglu set a new all-time lap record in Saturday morning’s Superpole qualification. He was over half a second faster than the rest of the field, securing his third pole position of the season. The first race turned into a showcase performance. Razgatlioglu pulled away from the field right from the start, extending his lead with each lap, setting a new lap record, and finishing more than eleven seconds ahead after 23 laps. The next win followed in the Superpole race on Sunday morning. Although Razgatlioglu fell to second place at the start, he regained the lead by the third lap. He pulled away from the field again, beat his previous day’s lap record, and won with a near five-second lead after ten laps. The second main race on Sunday afternoon was the final challenge. Razgatlioglu again pulled away from the start, set another new lap record, and finished eight seconds ahead as the winner.\n\nLocal hero Redding also shone at his home race. Already strong in practice, he secured the third start position in Superpole. In the first race, he held second place for a long time and fought for the podium before a technical issue forced him to retire a few laps before the end. In the Superpole Race, Redding seized his next opportunity. After a hectic start, he was in sixth place, and with determined manoeuvres, he fought his way forward.

The latest version of the BMW X3 is poised for market launch in China. The country’s most successful Sports Activity Vehicle will arrive at Chinese dealerships in just a few days and will go on sale later in February 2025.\n\nDrive system: two petrol engines to choose from.\n\nThis exclusive version of the BMW X3 was developed and will be produced specifically for the Chinese market to meet the exacting expectations of customers in the high-growth SAV segment. The outgoing model was the strongest-selling BMW vehicle worldwide in 2023. 156,000 units were delivered in China alone – accounting for around 40 per cent of all BMW X model sales in the region.\n\nThe new BMW X3 will be launched in China with two engine variants. Customers can choose from a pair of four-cylinder petrol engines: the BMW X3 xDrive 25L Luxury develops 140 kW (190 hp) and maximum torque of 310 Nm (229 lb-ft). This is enough to accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.7 seconds on the way to a top speed of 214 km/h (133 mph). The even more dynamic BMW X3 xDrive 30L – available in the equipment variants Pioneering MSP and Exclusive MSP – generates 190 kW (258 hp) and peak torque of 400 Nm (295 lb-ft), and sprints from rest to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 6.5 seconds. Top speed is 239 km/h (148 mph).\n\nLonger wheelbase, more space, more comfort.Alongside its BMW-typical sporting ability, the new SAV for the premium midsize class majors on high quality and comfort. For the first time, the version of the BMW X3 produced in China for China has an extended wheelbase. Yet it also retains the 50:50 weight distribution for which BMW is renowned, which results in almost perfect balance and therefore top-class handling. In addition, the 111-millimetre-longer wheelbase ensures even smoother and even more stable driving characteristics. And once inside, passengers can enjoy a significantly enhanced feeling of space.\n\nThis extra spaciousness is particularly noticeable in the rear compartment. Here, kneeroom has increased by a full 96 millimetres and legroom to over a metre. The new BMW X3 with extended wheelbase is 126 millimetres longer than the predecessor model and 25 millimetres wider. Its exterior length of 4,865 millimetres and width of 1,920 millimetres also mean it has the largest dimensions of any vehicle in its segment. However, it still has the hallmark proportions of a BMW X model, complete with a long roofline flowing smoothly into the rear end and a dynamically stretched silhouette.\n\nGenerous and exclusive equipment with a host of highlights. The luxurious driving experience is complemented by the high-quality and exclusive specification of the new BMW X3. Playing a prominent role here are the standard features enhanced by an array of market-specific details. Thanks to the new BMW iDrive based on BMW Operating System 9, customers in China benefit from a large number of exclusive digital services. The content of the BMW Digital Premium offering has been adapted precisely to the particular requirements and demands of customers in the Chinese market.\n\nThe exterior also stars with exclusive details for the Chinese market. Both model variants come as standard with BMW Iconic Glow contour lighting, which shows off the BMW kidney grille to eye-catching effect. The range of colour shades available comprises five exquisite metallic paint finishes, including a particularly striking Frozen variant that gives the car a visually impactful presence.\n\nFrom China, for China: local production brings many benefits.The two BMW X3 variants are tailored more keenly than ever to the preferences of discerning target groups in China. The vehicle concept, design, technology and equipment have all been adapted as required with no change to the prices asked for the predecessor model. BMW has also focused on its Shenyang base in China when it comes to development and production. The new BMW X3 models will be built at Plant Lydia, which BMW operates in tandem with its joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) and which employs cutting-edge, resource-conserving and efficient production methods.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\n“With the new BMW R 1300 RT, we’ve taken the touring icon from BMW Motorrrad to a whole new level. It is lighter in design, more accessible and more dynamic than ever before. In addition, with a completely new engine, chassis and aerodynamics, it offers a riding experience that meets the highest demands in this segment in terms of dynamics, comfort and travel capability\". Harald Spagl, Project Manager BMW R 1300 RT\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT: Wider range from comfortable tourer to dynamic country road motorcycle. Dynamic design language with optimised wind and weather protection.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT follows in the footsteps of its highly successful predecessor. It continues to build on the proven qualities of the BMW RT, such as touring capability and riding comfort - alone, as a pair or with plenty of luggage.\n\nAt the same time, the new R 1300 RT has broadened its usage profile by making its dynamic systems even more prominent. Sporty optional equipment such as the sport brake, the enhanced Shift Assistant Pro and the newly developed DCA electronic suspension allow an even more active and dynamic riding style. The range of optional extras is complemented by the Automated Shift Assistant ASA, which can be ridden in a sporty and dynamic manual mode, but also allows comfortable riding in automatic mode. All this, combined with a more dynamic and visually lighter design, promises to continue the success story of the BMW RT.\n\nThe wind and weather protection concept of the new R 1300 RT includes adjustable side trim that is homogeneously integrated into the design. This makes it possible to provide the rider with an adequate supply of fresh air at all times, even in challenging conditions such as city traffic or high outside temperatures on country roads, and to offer highly effective protection from the wind and weather at low temperatures when riding on the highway or motorway.\n\nIn addition to the basic version in Alpine White 3 uni colour, the new BMW R 1300 RT is available in the Triple Black model variant in Blackstorm metallic, the emphatically dynamic Impulse model variant in Racing Blue metallic and the particularly elegant model variant Option 719 Camargue in Blue Ridge Mountain metallic.\n\nPerfect ergonomics and equipment for comfortable and dynamic travelling and touring.\n\nThe BMW R 1300 RT's design, engine and chassis are not the only aspects of the BMW touring icon that reflect the BMW Motorrad development team's ambition to expand the range of possible uses of the new BMW R 1300 RT and make it even more dynamic. Equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new R 1300 RT have been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward. This results in improved feedback from the front section and therefore even greater controllability during dynamic riding. At the same time, the more active seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. The height and angle of the rider's seat can be adjusted to fine-tune the riding position. Passenger comfort has also been significantly improved. The new cases now offer more space for the passenger’s lower legs without compromising the volume of the cases. The passenger seat has also been lengthened. There is now more space to change your seating position from time to time on longer trips.\n\nA choice of different seat heights for optimum riding comfort and a new luggage system with electric cases and topcase. Additional variable-volume case system for optimum customisation.\n\nAs usual, BMW Motorrad's engineers have paid particular attention to easy access and a low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 RT placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of only 780 mm. The inner leg curve is also significantly smaller than on the previous model. In addition to the standard seat, other seats are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT is equipped as standard with cases (27 litres each) for touring and holiday trips. Further highlights of the new R 1300 RT are the Vario cases, available ex works for the first time as an optional equipment for a BMW RT. The variable luggage system allows the volume to be adjusted from 27 to 33 litres to suit the width of the motorcycle. Both cases are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The two topcases with a capacity of 39 and 54 litres respectively offer additional storage space. The large 54-litre luggage compartment is also electric. A special feature is the heated backrest for the passenger.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power output and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 RT has a capacity of exactly 1,300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7,750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 ,00 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6,250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9,000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 RT has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 RT can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, the engine drag control instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated Shift Assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the Automated Shift Assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre - without sacrificing the dynamics of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 RT has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 RT now has an aluminium lattice tube rear frame.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 RT is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nThe best of both worlds: EVO Telelever front wheel guide with flex element and new EVO Paralever rear wheel guide for even greater steering precision and ride stability. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nThe front wheel guide in the new R 1300 RT follows the Telelever principle introduced by BMW Motorrad 30 years ago - but in an innovative, newly designed form that combines the best of both worlds.\n\nWith the Evo Telelever, BMW Motorrad now combines the strengths of the two previously used Telelever variants in the new BMW R 1300 RT. Clamped tightly to the fork tubes - as previously in the sporty design - the upper fork construction (as in the GS) incorporates a handlebar decoupling system that prevents any detrimental tilting movement and only transmits steering forces.\n\nThe rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 RT has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels.\n\nNew electronic suspension Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) for two rider-selectable riding positions for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling as well as with dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation as optional equipment ex works.\n\nEven the standard Dynamic ESA electronic chassis offers a high level of riding safety and riding enjoyment on a wide variety of road surfaces thanks to dynamic adjustment of the damping and load-dependent adjustment of the rear spring preload.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) now goes one step further and, in addition to the familiar Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) options - such as dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation - offers two rider-selectable riding positions via the riding modes for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling. This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience in all conditions.\n\nDCA has been developed with equal emphasis on dynamic performance and comfort. The new semi-active chassis offers two different riding positions. One riding position has a flat steering head angle and therefore a chassis geometry designed to maximise riding stability and smoothness. The second riding position features firmer damping tuning, a higher spring rate and a higher ride height. Raising the rear end more than the front results in a steeper steering head angle and reduced castor, making the motorcycle easier to steer and handle. DCA makes these two different chassis geometries possible and combines them with the riding modes.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 RT comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 RT can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nNew full LED headlights and state-of-the-art LED light units feature all round. Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight and pitch compensation as well as adaptive light modes with intelligent adjustment of the alignment and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations are available as optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor decades now, BMW Motorrad has been regarded as a frontrunner when it comes to safety in connection with motorcycling. Accordingly, the new R 1300 RT comes with state-of-the-art LED light units all around as standard. The new full LED headlamp which illuminates the road with unrivalled brightness and clarity, underlines the prestige of the new R 1300 RT. The light unit consists of an LED module with multiple LEDs for low beam and high beam. The daytime running light or position light icon (depending on the market), which is positioned to the left and right of the headlamp, provides a distinctive look.\n\nHeadlight Pro goes one step further available as optional equipment ex works. In addition to the adaptive headlight, the headlamp of the new R 1300 RT also features pitch compensation - for example when accelerating and decelerating as well as for levelling the riding position in DCA. Headlight Pro features a servomotor that automatically and actively adjusts the position of the cut-off line to keep the vertical inclination within the optimum range when the load or load status changes.\n\nHeadlight Pro can be further enhanced with the optional “Adaptive Light Modes” (depending on market), which offer lighting technology that intelligently adapts the direction and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations. The Adaptive Lighting Modes provide optimum lighting conditions for night-time riding with speed-dependent road illumination. Lighting is provided in several stages: for low, medium and high speeds. Intelligent adaptation to speed and riding conditions increases safety and helps to guide the rider.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW) for convenient and safe motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT is already equipped with Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) with braking function as standard. The Riding Assistant offers many more functions as an optional extra ex works. It consists of Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW).\n\n10.25-inch TFT colour display with map navigation, a wide range of functions and new Connectivity Hub for controlling accessories as well as actively ventilated smartphone charging compartment with USB-C charging port as standard.\n\nThe R 1300 RT comes fitted as standard with a 10.25-inch TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation and newly developed Connectivity Hub. With maximum connectivity, excellent readability, clear menu navigation and a highly integrated operating concept, the new R 1300 RT maintains its leading position among production motorcycles.\n\nThe “tiles” shown can be used to select the “My Motorcycle”, “Radio”, “Navigation”, “Media”, “Phone” and “Settings” menus. A new feature is the Connectivity Hub \"tile\" for connecting current and future accessories such as smart glasses, heated vests and lightweight jackets. This simplifies the operation of the accessories.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT comes as standard with an actively ventilated smartphone charging compartment located within the rider's reach. It is even easier to open than its predecessor and can accommodate much larger smartphones. The smartphone battery is charged via a USB-C interface. The lid also has a clip that can be used for a debit card or banknotes.\n\nAudio System and Audio Pro available as optional extras ex-works for outstanding sound.\n\nWith the Audio System, the new R 1300 RT offers an even more intense sound experience. It features a high level of integration with the vehicle's electrical system. The menu control, setting options and unique display concept make the audio experience perfect in terms of interaction as well. In addition to the loudspeakers, a connected communication system can also be used for playback.\n\nAudio Pro offers an even more impressive sound experience. Ordered as optional equipment to the audio system, it features higher quality loudspeakers with separate tweeter/midrange and woofer control for extra powerful, crystal-clear sound. A choice of sound profiles and dynamic volume control ensure optimum listening pleasure in every riding situation. Audio Pro is also a visual highlight. A silver perforated grille without fleece provides a clear view of the speakers with their gold dust protection dome.\n\nOptional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 RT.\n\nAn extensive programme of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 RT.\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW R 1300 RT:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The new BMW R 1300 RT: The touring icon even more accessible and more dynamic than ever before, offering a wider range from comfortable tourer to dynamic country road motorcycle."}]}

The large 54-litre luggage compartment is also electric. A special feature is the heated backrest for the passenger.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power output and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 RT has a capacity of exactly 1,300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7,750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 ,00 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6,250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9,000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 RT has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 RT can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, the engine drag control instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated Shift Assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the Automated Shift Assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre - without sacrificing the dynamics of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 RT has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 RT now has an aluminium lattice tube rear frame.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 RT is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nThe best of both worlds: EVO Telelever front wheel guide with flex element and new EVO Paralever rear wheel guide for even greater steering precision and ride stability. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nThe front wheel guide in the new R 1300 RT follows the Telelever principle introduced by BMW Motorrad 30 years ago - but in an innovative, newly designed form that combines the best of both worlds.\n\nWith the Evo Telelever, BMW Motorrad now combines the strengths of the two previously used Telelever variants in the new BMW R 1300 RT. Clamped tightly to the fork tubes - as previously in the sporty design - the upper fork construction (as in the GS) incorporates a handlebar decoupling system that prevents any detrimental tilting movement and only transmits steering forces.\n\nThe rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 RT has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels.\n\nNew electronic suspension Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) for two rider-selectable riding positions for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling as well as with dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation as optional equipment ex works.\n\nEven the standard Dynamic ESA electronic chassis offers a high level of riding safety and riding enjoyment on a wide variety of road surfaces thanks to dynamic adjustment of the damping and load-dependent adjustment of the rear spring preload.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) now goes one step further and, in addition to the familiar Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) options - such as dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation - offers two rider-selectable riding positions via the riding modes for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling. This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience in all conditions.\n\nDCA has been developed with equal emphasis on dynamic performance and comfort. The new semi-active chassis offers two different riding positions. One riding position has a flat steering head angle and therefore a chassis geometry designed to maximise riding stability and smoothness. The second riding position features firmer damping tuning, a higher spring rate and a higher ride height. Raising the rear end more than the front results in a steeper steering head angle and reduced castor, making the motorcycle easier to steer and handle. DCA makes these two different chassis geometries possible and combines them with the riding modes.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 RT comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 RT can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nNew full LED headlights and state-of-the-art LED light units feature all round. Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight and pitch compensation as well as adaptive light modes with intelligent adjustment of the alignment and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations are available as optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor decades now, BMW Motorrad has been regarded as a frontrunner when it comes to safety in connection with motorcycling. Accordingly, the new R 1300 RT comes with state-of-the-art LED light units all around as standard. The new full LED headlamp which illuminates the road with unrivalled brightness and clarity, underlines the prestige of the new R 1300 RT. The light unit consists of an LED module with multiple LEDs for low beam and high beam. The daytime running light or position light icon (depending on the market), which is positioned to the left and right of the headlamp, provides a distinctive look.\n\nHeadlight Pro goes one step further available as optional equipment ex works. In addition to the adaptive headlight, the headlamp of the new R 1300 RT also features pitch compensation - for example when accelerating and decelerating as well as for levelling the riding position in DCA. Headlight Pro features a servomotor that automatically and actively adjusts the position of the cut-off line to keep the vertical inclination within the optimum range when the load or load status changes.\n\nHeadlight Pro can be further enhanced with the optional “Adaptive Light Modes” (depending on market), which offer lighting technology that intelligently adapts the direction and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations. The Adaptive Lighting Modes provide optimum lighting conditions for night-time riding with speed-dependent road illumination. Lighting is provided in several stages: for low, medium and high speeds. Intelligent adaptation to speed and riding conditions increases safety and helps to guide the rider.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW) for convenient and safe motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT is already equipped with Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) with braking function as standard. The Riding Assistant offers many more functions as an optional extra ex works.

It is lighter in design, more accessible and more dynamic than ever before. In addition, with a completely new engine, chassis and aerodynamics, it offers a riding experience that meets the highest demands in this segment in terms of dynamics, comfort and travel capability\". Harald Spagl, Project Manager BMW R 1300 RT\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT: Wider range from comfortable tourer to dynamic country road motorcycle. Dynamic design language with optimised wind and weather protection.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT follows in the footsteps of its highly successful predecessor. It continues to build on the proven qualities of the BMW RT, such as touring capability and riding comfort - alone, as a pair or with plenty of luggage.\n\nAt the same time, the new R 1300 RT has broadened its usage profile by making its dynamic systems even more prominent. Sporty optional equipment such as the sport brake, the enhanced Shift Assistant Pro and the newly developed DCA electronic suspension allow an even more active and dynamic riding style. The range of optional extras is complemented by the Automated Shift Assistant ASA, which can be ridden in a sporty and dynamic manual mode, but also allows comfortable riding in automatic mode. All this, combined with a more dynamic and visually lighter design, promises to continue the success story of the BMW RT.\n\nThe wind and weather protection concept of the new R 1300 RT includes adjustable side trim that is homogeneously integrated into the design. This makes it possible to provide the rider with an adequate supply of fresh air at all times, even in challenging conditions such as city traffic or high outside temperatures on country roads, and to offer highly effective protection from the wind and weather at low temperatures when riding on the highway or motorway.\n\nIn addition to the basic version in Alpine White 3 uni colour, the new BMW R 1300 RT is available in the Triple Black model variant in Blackstorm metallic, the emphatically dynamic Impulse model variant in Racing Blue metallic and the particularly elegant model variant Option 719 Camargue in Blue Ridge Mountain metallic.\n\nPerfect ergonomics and equipment for comfortable and dynamic travelling and touring.\n\nThe BMW R 1300 RT's design, engine and chassis are not the only aspects of the BMW touring icon that reflect the BMW Motorrad development team's ambition to expand the range of possible uses of the new BMW R 1300 RT and make it even more dynamic. Equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new R 1300 RT have been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward. This results in improved feedback from the front section and therefore even greater controllability during dynamic riding. At the same time, the more active seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. The height and angle of the rider's seat can be adjusted to fine-tune the riding position. Passenger comfort has also been significantly improved. The new cases now offer more space for the passenger’s lower legs without compromising the volume of the cases. The passenger seat has also been lengthened. There is now more space to change your seating position from time to time on longer trips.\n\nA choice of different seat heights for optimum riding comfort and a new luggage system with electric cases and topcase. Additional variable-volume case system for optimum customisation.\n\nAs usual, BMW Motorrad's engineers have paid particular attention to easy access and a low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 RT placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of only 780 mm. The inner leg curve is also significantly smaller than on the previous model. In addition to the standard seat, other seats are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 RT is equipped as standard with cases (27 litres each) for touring and holiday trips.

On request the new R 1300 RT can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, the engine drag control instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated Shift Assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the Automated Shift Assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre - without sacrificing the dynamics of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 RT has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 RT now has an aluminium lattice tube rear frame.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 RT is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nThe best of both worlds: EVO Telelever front wheel guide with flex element and new EVO Paralever rear wheel guide for even greater steering precision and ride stability. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nThe front wheel guide in the new R 1300 RT follows the Telelever principle introduced by BMW Motorrad 30 years ago - but in an innovative, newly designed form that combines the best of both worlds.\n\nWith the Evo Telelever, BMW Motorrad now combines the strengths of the two previously used Telelever variants in the new BMW R 1300 RT. Clamped tightly to the fork tubes - as previously in the sporty design - the upper fork construction (as in the GS) incorporates a handlebar decoupling system that prevents any detrimental tilting movement and only transmits steering forces.\n\nThe rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 RT has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels.\n\nNew electronic suspension Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) for two rider-selectable riding positions for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling as well as with dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation as optional equipment ex works.\n\nEven the standard Dynamic ESA electronic chassis offers a high level of riding safety and riding enjoyment on a wide variety of road surfaces thanks to dynamic adjustment of the damping and load-dependent adjustment of the rear spring preload.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Chassis Adaption (DCA) now goes one step further and, in addition to the familiar Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) options - such as dynamic adjustment of damping, spring rate and load equalisation - offers two rider-selectable riding positions via the riding modes for maximum spread between ride comfort and dynamic handling. This makes for an even more thrilling riding experience in all conditions.\n\nDCA has been developed with equal emphasis on dynamic performance and comfort. The new semi-active chassis offers two different riding positions. One riding position has a flat steering head angle and therefore a chassis geometry designed to maximise riding stability and smoothness. The second riding position features firmer damping tuning, a higher spring rate and a higher ride height. Raising the rear end more than the front results in a steeper steering head angle and reduced castor, making the motorcycle easier to steer and handle. DCA makes these two different chassis geometries possible and combines them with the riding modes.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 RT comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 RT can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nNew full LED headlights and state-of-the-art LED light units feature all round. Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight and pitch compensation as well as adaptive light modes with intelligent adjustment of the alignment and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations are available as optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor decades now, BMW Motorrad has been regarded as a frontrunner when it comes to safety in connection with motorcycling. Accordingly, the new R 1300 RT comes with state-of-the-art LED light units all around as standard. The new full LED headlamp which illuminates the road with unrivalled brightness and clarity, underlines the prestige of the new R 1300 RT. The light unit consists of an LED module with multiple LEDs for low beam and high beam. The daytime running light or position light icon (depending on the market), which is positioned to the left and right of the headlamp, provides a distinctive look.\n\nHeadlight Pro goes one step further available as optional equipment ex works. In addition to the adaptive headlight, the headlamp of the new R 1300 RT also features pitch compensation - for example when accelerating and decelerating as well as for levelling the riding position in DCA. Headlight Pro features a servomotor that automatically and actively adjusts the position of the cut-off line to keep the vertical inclination within the optimum range when the load or load status changes.\n\nHeadlight Pro can be further enhanced with the optional “Adaptive Light Modes” (depending on market), which offer lighting technology that intelligently adapts the direction and intensity of the low beam to different riding situations. The Adaptive Lighting Modes provide optimum lighting conditions for night-time riding with speed-dependent road illumination. Lighting is provided in several stages: for low, medium and high speeds. Intelligent adaptation to speed and riding conditions increases safety and helps to guide the rider.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW) for convenient and safe motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT is already equipped with Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) with braking function as standard. The Riding Assistant offers many more functions as an optional extra ex works. It consists of Active Cruise Control (ACC), Front Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Change Warning (SWW) and Rear End Collision Warning (RECW).\n\n10.25-inch TFT colour display with map navigation, a wide range of functions and new Connectivity Hub for controlling accessories as well as actively ventilated smartphone charging compartment with USB-C charging port as standard.\n\nThe R 1300 RT comes fitted as standard with a 10.25-inch TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation and newly developed Connectivity Hub. With maximum connectivity, excellent readability, clear menu navigation and a highly integrated operating concept, the new R 1300 RT maintains its leading position among production motorcycles.\n\nThe “tiles” shown can be used to select the “My Motorcycle”, “Radio”, “Navigation”, “Media”, “Phone” and “Settings” menus. A new feature is the Connectivity Hub \"tile\" for connecting current and future accessories such as smart glasses, heated vests and lightweight jackets. This simplifies the operation of the accessories.\n\nThe new R 1300 RT comes as standard with an actively ventilated smartphone charging compartment located within the rider's reach. It is even easier to open than its predecessor and can accommodate much larger smartphones. The smartphone battery is charged via a USB-C interface. The lid also has a clip that can be used for a debit card or banknotes.\n\nAudio System and Audio Pro available as optional extras ex-works for outstanding sound.\n\nWith the Audio System, the new R 1300 RT offers an even more intense sound experience. It features a high level of integration with the vehicle's electrical system. The menu control, setting options and unique display concept make the audio experience perfect in terms of interaction as well. In addition to the loudspeakers, a connected communication system can also be used for playback.\n\nAudio Pro offers an even more impressive sound experience. Ordered as optional equipment to the audio system, it features higher quality loudspeakers with separate tweeter/midrange and woofer control for extra powerful, crystal-clear sound. A choice of sound profiles and dynamic volume control ensure optimum listening pleasure in every riding situation. Audio Pro is also a visual highlight. A silver perforated grille without fleece provides a clear view of the speakers with their gold dust protection dome.\n\nOptional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 RT.\n\nAn extensive programme of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 RT.\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW R 1300 RT:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Kit"}]}

Electrification continues at BMW Group Plant Leipzig: Four months after launching production of the combustion-engined MINI Countryman, the all-electric version is now rolling off the lines at Leipzig as well. After phasing out production of the BMW i3, the birthplace of electric mobility at the BMW Group has welcomed another fully electric car to its range. It now manufactures four models with three drive types by two brands, all on a single production line: the BMW 1 Series, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer (including the plug-in hybrid version), the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe and the MINI Countryman in both its fully electric and combustion-powered versions.\n\nConsistent plant upgrades and flexible production system\n\nTo enable production of up to 350,000 units a year – 100,000 more than previously – Plant Leipzig has been continuously upgraded since 2018, with extensive additions and upgrades to the bodyshop, paintshop, assembly and logistics. “Our cars and components are very much in demand. In recent years the BMW Group has invested around 1.6 billion euros in the Leipzig site to produce additional vehicles and electric components, and now we’re increasing vehicle volumes too – which is great news for our plant,” said Petra Peterhänsel, Plant Director.\n\nThe main driver behind the volume increase is the MINI Countryman. During the course of 2024, output will rise to almost 500 units a day – on top of the 800 or so BMW vehicles the plant is producing. What’s more, thanks to its flexible production system, Plant Leipzig is in a position to respond quickly to customer demand, for example by increasing the share of fully electric vehicles.\n\nFlexible assembly structures also meant the MINI Countryman Electric could be integrated seamlessly into production. The situation is similar with the different drive units, which are all produced on one and the same line in aggregate assembly and prepared for what’s known as “marriage” with the body. The e-drives, transmissions and control electronics (collectively known as the highly integrated electric drive topology, or HEAT) for the two all-electric models are connected directly in the plant. A new production line was required only for the control electronics.\n\nMore staff and nightshifts for increased production volume\n\nHigher production volume means secure employment and up to 900 additional employees in vehicle production alone. By the end of 2024, Plant Leipzig will employ around 7,000 BMW staff. Working hours will need to be adjusted in all technologies, with nightshifts in assembly starting for the first time in September of this year and cars being produced round the clock in three shifts.\n\n“Plant Leipzig first went on stream in 2005 with about 2,600 employees in production. 19 years later there are over 7,000. Over the years, the plant has grown steadily and considerably. The start of nightshifts in assembly represents another important milestone in the success story of our plant and is a clear show of confidence by our company in our site here in Leipzig,” emphasised Works Council Chairman Jens Köhler.\n\nMade at Plant Leipzig: high-voltage batteries for the MINI Countryman Electric\n\nWith the production launch of the MINI Countryman Electric, all three stages of the Gen 5 high-voltage battery production process are now represented at BMW Group Plant Leipzig: cell coating, module production and battery assembly. Operations in all three are currently ramping up, with five cell-coating, three module-production and two high-voltage battery-production lines now in place.\n\n“We are in the middle of the transformation to e-mobility,” said Markus Fallböhmer, Head of Battery Production at the BMW Group. “Starting this year, Plant Leipzig will carry out every stage of our in-house high-voltage battery production process. It’s our next great step forwards.”\n\nPlant Leipzig’s e-component production capacity has been increasing since 2021. It will now manufacture not just the high-voltage batteries for the MINI Countryman Electric but also e-components for the BMW iX1, BMW iX2, BMW i4, BMW i5 and BMW iX made at other sites. The e-component production unit at Leipzig currently employs some 1,000 people.\n\nTo enable production of high-voltage batteries, spaces previously used for the BMW i3 and BMW i8 have been converted and new buildings added. One of them is a new hall with a footprint of about 61,000 m2. This houses two lines capable of producing up to 300,000 high-voltage batteries a year. The BMW Group has invested over 900 million euros in e-component production at Plant Leipzig to date.\n\nResource-saving painting processes\n\nThe burner technology used to dry the paint on contrast roofs was also converted for the start of MINI Countryman production and now consists of a bivalent system. The fuel-flexible burners can run on hydrogen (H2) as well as gas (methane, CH4) and even switch between the two while in operation. Five such bivalent hydrogen-capable burners are used to produce the contrast roofs for the MINI Countryman.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Countryman E Electricity consumption combined: 17,4 – 15,7 kWh/100 km according to WLTPCO2 emissions combined according to WLTP: 0 g/kmCO2 Class: AElectric range according to WLTP: 462 – 423 km MINI Countryman SE ALL4 Electricity consumption combined: 18,5 – 16,8 kWh/100 km according to WLTPCO2 emissions combined according to WLTP: 0 g/kmCO2 Class: AElectric range according to WLTP: 432 – 399 km"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Higher volumes and a growing team +++ New night shift in assembly +++ High-voltage batteries produced in-house +++"}]}

A new production line was required only for the control electronics.\n\nMore staff and nightshifts for increased production volume\n\nHigher production volume means secure employment and up to 900 additional employees in vehicle production alone. By the end of 2024, Plant Leipzig will employ around 7,000 BMW staff. Working hours will need to be adjusted in all technologies, with nightshifts in assembly starting for the first time in September of this year and cars being produced round the clock in three shifts.\n\n“Plant Leipzig first went on stream in 2005 with about 2,600 employees in production. 19 years later there are over 7,000. Over the years, the plant has grown steadily and considerably. The start of nightshifts in assembly represents another important milestone in the success story of our plant and is a clear show of confidence by our company in our site here in Leipzig,” emphasised Works Council Chairman Jens Köhler.\n\nMade at Plant Leipzig: high-voltage batteries for the MINI Countryman Electric\n\nWith the production launch of the MINI Countryman Electric, all three stages of the Gen 5 high-voltage battery production process are now represented at BMW Group Plant Leipzig: cell coating, module production and battery assembly. Operations in all three are currently ramping up, with five cell-coating, three module-production and two high-voltage battery-production lines now in place.\n\n“We are in the middle of the transformation to e-mobility,” said Markus Fallböhmer, Head of Battery Production at the BMW Group. “Starting this year, Plant Leipzig will carry out every stage of our in-house high-voltage battery production process. It’s our next great step forwards.”\n\nPlant Leipzig’s e-component production capacity has been increasing since 2021. It will now manufacture not just the high-voltage batteries for the MINI Countryman Electric but also e-components for the BMW iX1, BMW iX2, BMW i4, BMW i5 and BMW iX made at other sites. The e-component production unit at Leipzig currently employs some 1,000 people.\n\nTo enable production of high-voltage batteries, spaces previously used for the BMW i3 and BMW i8 have been converted and new buildings added. One of them is a new hall with a footprint of about 61,000 m2. This houses two lines capable of producing up to 300,000 high-voltage batteries a year. The BMW Group has invested over 900 million euros in e-component production at Plant Leipzig to date.\n\nResource-saving painting processes\n\nThe burner technology used to dry the paint on contrast roofs was also converted for the start of MINI Countryman production and now consists of a bivalent system. The fuel-flexible burners can run on hydrogen (H2) as well as gas (methane, CH4) and even switch between the two while in operation. Five such bivalent hydrogen-capable burners are used to produce the contrast roofs for the MINI Countryman.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Countryman E Electricity consumption combined: 17,4 – 15,7 kWh/100 km according to WLTPCO2 emissions combined according to WLTP: 0 g/kmCO2 Class: AElectric range according to WLTP: 462 – 423 km MINI Countryman SE ALL4 Electricity consumption combined: 18,5 – 16,8 kWh/100 km according to WLTPCO2 emissions combined according to WLTP: 0 g/kmCO2 Class: AElectric range according to WLTP: 432 – 399 km"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Production launch of the MINI Countryman Electric at BMW Group Plant Leipzig"}]}

This coming weekend, BMW M Team WRT will make its debut with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) during the official sanctioned test at Daytona (USA). The hypercar from BMW M Motorsport will hit the track at the International Speedway sporting its new design and, for the first time, its new headlights. The track lights combine cutting-edge lighting technology with iconic design. Over the two test days, six BMW M works drivers will take the wheel of the two BMW M Hybrid V8s.\n\nThe aerodynamic updates to the BMW M Hybrid V8 for the 2026 season were already showcased during previous test drives, including the smaller kidney grille and the modified front splitter designed to optimise airflow and cooling. Now, Daytona will see the addition of another significant update: the new headlights. The advanced technology of the track lights ensures improved visibility for drivers during the numerous night races in the IMSA series and the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). These include the 24-hour highlights at Daytona and Le Mans (FRA), as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA), Petit Le Mans in North America, and the FIA WEC events in Qatar and Bahrain. The track lights illuminate the car's surroundings even more brightly, helping drivers better assess race situations, especially in poorly lit sections of the track.\n\nIn addition to technological advancements, the new headlights also offer an iconic design element. The yellow accents of the yellow lights pay homage to the current generation of BMW M Motorsport race cars, as the EVO models of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 share the same design features. Furthermore, they are a nod to the high-performance vehicles of BMW M GmbH. For example, the current CS models of the BMW M3, BMW M4, and BMW M5 feature yellow headlights, as do BMW M models from previous generations. Alongside the headlights, the kidney grille of the BMW M Hybrid V8 will also stand out at night thanks to its unique contour lighting, BMW Iconic Glow.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, BMW M Team WRT will have five test sessions to gain initial experience with the hypercar on the Daytona International Speedway and familiarise themselves with the procedures of the IMSA series. The Belgian team, which already knows the car well from two seasons in the FIA WEC, will be supported at Daytona by BMW M Team RLL. This collaboration aims to ease and accelerate BMW M Team WRT's adaptation to the IMSA series. Behind the wheel of cars number 24 and 25, BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), René Rast (GER), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) will alternate during the two test days.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “I am very excited that we can present and test the update of our BMW M Hybrid V8 at Daytona for the first time in the IMSA environment. The new design and headlights not only look spectacular but are also intended to further optimise performance. We will work hard on this during the test at Daytona, as well as in January during the Roar.

About five weeks before the season opener at Australian Phillip Island, BMW Motorrad Motorsport presented the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) line-up to the public in Berlin (GER) on Wednesday. The two teams, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, as well as the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), Michael van der Mark (NED), Scott Redding (GBR), and Garrett Gerloff (USA), unveiled their BMW M 1000 RR superbikes for the WorldSBK 2024 for the first time. The event took place at a special location, in the new BMW Motorrad Welt at the BMW Motorrad Plant Berlin. This plant is the heart of the BMW Motorrad production and the birthplace of the BMW M 1000 RR.\n\nOn Tuesday, Razgatlioglu, van der Mark, Redding, and Gerloff were guests at the BMW Motorrad Plant, and during an exclusive autograph session, the employees had the opportunity to personally meet their racing colleagues from the BMW Motorrad family. On Wednesday, the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders gained closer insights into the production of the bikes, including their racing machines, during a tour of the plant.\n\nThe actual team presentation took place afterwards in BMW Motorrad World, the new “Home of the Brand” in Berlin, opened in autumn 2023. The official start of the 2024 WorldSBK occurred with the unveiling of the BMW M 1000 RR superbikes, which Razgatlioglu, van der Mark, Redding, and Gerloff will ride in the upcoming season with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team.\n\nA special feature of the team presentation in Berlin was that in addition to invited guests, fans also had the opportunity to witness the event live on-site. Many of them seized the opportunity, secured the coveted free tickets for the event, and could personally interact with the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders during the subsequent autograph session.\n\nIn preparation for the 2024 season, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the two teams, and the riders will be back on the track soon. The next test sessions will take place at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, on January 24th and 25th. The first race weekend of the season is scheduled from February 23rd to 25th at Phillip Island (AUS).\n\nQuotes after the Team Presentation in Berlin.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “First of all, I would like to thank everyone involved in the organisation. It was an absolutely cool event here at BMW Motorrad Welt. It was very nice to show the team managers and riders what we do here in Berlin. We haven’t done this in this form before. The atmosphere among all involved was fantastic, and that is also extremely important for performance because we have this one team mentality. The presentation itself in BMW Motorrad Welt was also very successful. I am confident for the new season. We still need a few tests; last year, we didn’t necessarily have the best conditions but we have prepared a lot of things. Now there is not much time left until Phillip Island. Although the first two events take place on tracks that haven’t necessarily been our strong suit in the past, I am still optimistic that we will have a good start, carry this positive energy into the first races and through the entire season.”\n\nShaun Muir (Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “First of all it is an outstanding venue for such a presentation. It think it really captures the spirit of what BMW Motorrad are trying to achieve here so I am super proud to be part of that. The tour around the plant was sensational. A big round of applause to all the guys, everyone in the factory; they really welcomed us. Moving on to the championship as such, I think it is absolutely clear that the combination of Michael and Toprak brings some special qualities. I think that is something we are really looking forward to working with. Already we can see what Toprak requires in terms of a package and a bike. It is a little bit different, not an awful lot, we just need to steer in a slightly different direction to give Toprak what he needs. And I say that in terms of letting him amplify his strengths which is hard on the brakes, corner entry, balance on the bike, something we know the BMW M 1000 RR can work well with. We want to put ourselves in a strong position, we want to compete for the podium in Australia. Can we get a podium? It's a tough question, but Toprak’s personal aims are that he thinks he can and we give him all the support to do that. Michael has missed large parts of the past two seasons, and he does not underestimate what he is up against but he is definitely up for that challenge. I feel that Toprak can bring a lot of strengths out of Michael. I am looking forward to seeing that because we saw how good Michael can be when things go well. The bike is getting better, there is a development team behind us. From where the project started in 2019 to where we are now is night and day. I hope we can take advantage of that and get our rewards.”\n\nMichael Galinski (Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “The team presentation was truly impressive. Many people attended, and it was very interesting at the BMW Motorrad plant and in the BMW Motorrad Welt. It was my first time at the plant itself, and it was fascinating to see the engine department and how all the motorcycles are assembled. It was great to take a behind-the-scenes look and also to present ourselves here as a team. We are very happy with our rider duo. They are two real top riders. Scott is the Vice World Champion, Garrett had a very strong second half of the season last year. Our goal is to move further forward, and with the BMW Motorrad family, this is certainly possible this season. So much manpower has been added that we are really happy now. Of course, we still need a bit of time, but we are confident that we will move forward this year.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff (#31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “It has been exciting. There has been a really cool energy here at Berlin. It’s great to be in Berlin, it’s really nice to see all the amazing people that work here in the plant, that develop and produce the BMW M 1000 RR that we race. So it’s really cool to have the team presentation here. It has been really nice to see Scott, Toprak and Michael and to get together after a couple of months of holidays and seeing family and friends. I can tell that we are all excited to get back on the track and to start testing again. In just over a month we are going to be racing in Australia. Everything is going to happen really fast from here on but I’ve been doing my part to make sure that I am ready for the season and I am excited to get started. I think we have a really good base now. I have one year behind me with BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, so a lot of information and I think we can come up with solutions faster than last year if we do have a problem. It is going to be good to go the every track with a higher potential, and I think it can be a really good season. My goal is to work on qualifying and to be a bit better there and that can help me in the beginning of the races and then at the end of the races, when I am strong, I think we can make some real progress and be up front.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#54 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “I am very happy to join the BMW Motorrad family. When I arrived at Berlin on Monday and left the airport I was really surprised because everyone spoke Turkish. Also at the plant, there a so many Turkish employees. I am very happy for this. In general, I am very positive. Especially today, there were a lot of people and I understand that a lot of people like me. A lot of people came here to see me, also many Turkish guys, and a lot of them came from very far away. Everyone can’t wait for the season, and that also goes for me. My focus is now on the season. I realized that the people believe in me, but it is important that you believe in your bike. Many people say that the BMW is not ready to fight for the championship but I believe that my bike is ready to fight for wins and the championship. We just need my setup, because my riding style is complete different. When we have this, we can easily fight for the win. Now I am just focusing on the test next week. It is really important for me. I need to adapt to the bike and I believe that we can fight for the podium and the wins this season. I am excited. I signed with BMW but I am also a part of the family. This is something I saw today again and it is great. I will give more than 100 percent, I will try to win with BMW. Everyone is working hard and this is a great extra motivation also for me. If we keep doing this, we will win the World Championship.”\n\nScott Redding (#45 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “It’s good to come here to Berlin. To come into the plant and to see how everything is made is always interesting, seeing the people in action at their work is always good. It’s also very interesting to see where the engines are built and how they do it, so it’s really nice to be here and to witness how everything is made. A launch is also always great, to unveil the colours of the bikes and the suites, together with the team-mates and the teams. Speaking about the coming season, for me it would be nice to have our bike to be more consistently competitive which I think we can do. We’ve had some good changes made and obviously Toprak is coming over. We also have a test team which makes a big difference. I think we are going in the right direction, which is important. It would be nice to stand on the podium again this year and more frequently, and to try to make our bad weekends not so bad and have a good, consistent year.”\n\nMichael van der Mark (#60 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It’s nice to start the season, it’s great to be here in Berlin. We all know that BMW is a big company but we got a nice tour through the plant and I must say that it is really impressive. It was also great to see where they prepare the race engines and I am really ready to start the season. I can’t wait to go testing again, I feel one hundred percent fit, I got a new teammate that seems to be really fast – so I am looking forward to it. Like I said, I am fit again, the bike is getting better and better, Toprak is pushing the project even more and I think we want to win races and be on the podium as soon as possible.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "About five weeks before the season opener, BMW Motorrad Motorsport presented the 2024 WorldSBK line-up to the public in Berlin.

Many people say that the BMW is not ready to fight for the championship but I believe that my bike is ready to fight for wins and the championship. We just need my setup, because my riding style is complete different. When we have this, we can easily fight for the win. Now I am just focusing on the test next week. It is really important for me. I need to adapt to the bike and I believe that we can fight for the podium and the wins this season. I am excited. I signed with BMW but I am also a part of the family. This is something I saw today again and it is great. I will give more than 100 percent, I will try to win with BMW. Everyone is working hard and this is a great extra motivation also for me. If we keep doing this, we will win the World Championship.”\n\nScott Redding (#45 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “It’s good to come here to Berlin. To come into the plant and to see how everything is made is always interesting, seeing the people in action at their work is always good. It’s also very interesting to see where the engines are built and how they do it, so it’s really nice to be here and to witness how everything is made. A launch is also always great, to unveil the colours of the bikes and the suites, together with the team-mates and the teams. Speaking about the coming season, for me it would be nice to have our bike to be more consistently competitive which I think we can do. We’ve had some good changes made and obviously Toprak is coming over. We also have a test team which makes a big difference. I think we are going in the right direction, which is important. It would be nice to stand on the podium again this year and more frequently, and to try to make our bad weekends not so bad and have a good, consistent year.”\n\nMichael van der Mark (#60 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It’s nice to start the season, it’s great to be here in Berlin. We all know that BMW is a big company but we got a nice tour through the plant and I must say that it is really impressive. It was also great to see where they prepare the race engines and I am really ready to start the season. I can’t wait to go testing again, I feel one hundred percent fit, I got a new teammate that seems to be really fast – so I am looking forward to it. Like I said, I am fit again, the bike is getting better and better, Toprak is pushing the project even more and I think we want to win races and be on the podium as soon as possible.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW Motorrad Motorsport Team Presentation: The 2024 WorldSBK kickoff takes place in the BMW Motorrad Welt in Berlin."}]}

The two teams, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, as well as the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), Michael van der Mark (NED), Scott Redding (GBR), and Garrett Gerloff (USA), unveiled their BMW M 1000 RR superbikes for the WorldSBK 2024.Berlin. About five weeks before the season opener at Australian Phillip Island, BMW Motorrad Motorsport presented the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) line-up to the public in Berlin (GER) on Wednesday. The two teams, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, as well as the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), Michael van der Mark (NED), Scott Redding (GBR), and Garrett Gerloff (USA), unveiled their BMW M 1000 RR superbikes for the WorldSBK 2024 for the first time. The event took place at a special location, in the new BMW Motorrad Welt at the BMW Motorrad Plant Berlin. This plant is the heart of the BMW Motorrad production and the birthplace of the BMW M 1000 RR.\n\nOn Tuesday, Razgatlioglu, van der Mark, Redding, and Gerloff were guests at the BMW Motorrad Plant, and during an exclusive autograph session, the employees had the opportunity to personally meet their racing colleagues from the BMW Motorrad family. On Wednesday, the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders gained closer insights into the production of the bikes, including their racing machines, during a tour of the plant.\n\nThe actual team presentation took place afterwards in BMW Motorrad World, the new “Home of the Brand” in Berlin, opened in autumn 2023. The official start of the 2024 WorldSBK occurred with the unveiling of the BMW M 1000 RR superbikes, which Razgatlioglu, van der Mark, Redding, and Gerloff will ride in the upcoming season with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team.\n\nA special feature of the team presentation in Berlin was that in addition to invited guests, fans also had the opportunity to witness the event live on-site. Many of them seized the opportunity, secured the coveted free tickets for the event, and could personally interact with the four BMW Motorrad WorldSBK factory riders during the subsequent autograph session.\n\nIn preparation for the 2024 season, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the two teams, and the riders will be back on the track soon. The next test sessions will take place at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, on January 24th and 25th. The first race weekend of the season is scheduled from February 23rd to 25th at Phillip Island (AUS).\n\nQuotes after the Team Presentation in Berlin.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “First of all, I would like to thank everyone involved in the organisation. It was an absolutely cool event here at BMW Motorrad Welt. It was very nice to show the team managers and riders what we do here in Berlin. We haven’t done this in this form before. The atmosphere among all involved was fantastic, and that is also extremely important for performance because we have this one team mentality. The presentation itself in BMW Motorrad Welt was also very successful. I am confident for the new season. We still need a few tests; last year, we didn’t necessarily have the best conditions but we have prepared a lot of things. Now there is not much time left until Phillip Island. Although the first two events take place on tracks that haven’t necessarily been our strong suit in the past, I am still optimistic that we will have a good start, carry this positive energy into the first races and through the entire season.”\n\nShaun Muir (Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “First of all it is an outstanding venue for such a presentation. It think it really captures the spirit of what BMW Motorrad are trying to achieve here so I am super proud to be part of that. The tour around the plant was sensational. A big round of applause to all the guys, everyone in the factory; they really welcomed us. Moving on to the championship as such, I think it is absolutely clear that the combination of Michael and Toprak brings some special qualities. I think that is something we are really looking forward to working with. Already we can see what Toprak requires in terms of a package and a bike. It is a little bit different, not an awful lot, we just need to steer in a slightly different direction to give Toprak what he needs. And I say that in terms of letting him amplify his strengths which is hard on the brakes, corner entry, balance on the bike, something we know the BMW M 1000 RR can work well with. We want to put ourselves in a strong position, we want to compete for the podium in Australia. Can we get a podium? It's a tough question, but Toprak’s personal aims are that he thinks he can and we give him all the support to do that. Michael has missed large parts of the past two seasons, and he does not underestimate what he is up against but he is definitely up for that challenge. I feel that Toprak can bring a lot of strengths out of Michael. I am looking forward to seeing that because we saw how good Michael can be when things go well. The bike is getting better, there is a development team behind us. From where the project started in 2019 to where we are now is night and day. I hope we can take advantage of that and get our rewards.”\n\nMichael Galinski (Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “The team presentation was truly impressive. Many people attended, and it was very interesting at the BMW Motorrad plant and in the BMW Motorrad Welt. It was my first time at the plant itself, and it was fascinating to see the engine department and how all the motorcycles are assembled. It was great to take a behind-the-scenes look and also to present ourselves here as a team. We are very happy with our rider duo. They are two real top riders. Scott is the Vice World Champion, Garrett had a very strong second half of the season last year. Our goal is to move further forward, and with the BMW Motorrad family, this is certainly possible this season. So much manpower has been added that we are really happy now. Of course, we still need a bit of time, but we are confident that we will move forward this year.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff (#31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “It has been exciting. There has been a really cool energy here at Berlin. It’s great to be in Berlin, it’s really nice to see all the amazing people that work here in the plant, that develop and produce the BMW M 1000 RR that we race. So it’s really cool to have the team presentation here. It has been really nice to see Scott, Toprak and Michael and to get together after a couple of months of holidays and seeing family and friends. I can tell that we are all excited to get back on the track and to start testing again. In just over a month we are going to be racing in Australia. Everything is going to happen really fast from here on but I’ve been doing my part to make sure that I am ready for the season and I am excited to get started. I think we have a really good base now. I have one year behind me with BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, so a lot of information and I think we can come up with solutions faster than last year if we do have a problem. It is going to be good to go the every track with a higher potential, and I think it can be a really good season. My goal is to work on qualifying and to be a bit better there and that can help me in the beginning of the races and then at the end of the races, when I am strong, I think we can make some real progress and be up front.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#54 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “I am very happy to join the BMW Motorrad family. When I arrived at Berlin on Monday and left the airport I was really surprised because everyone spoke Turkish. Also at the plant, there a so many Turkish employees. I am very happy for this. In general, I am very positive. Especially today, there were a lot of people and I understand that a lot of people like me.

The finale promises to be thrilling, with many decisions still open in the GT World Challenge Europe, most notably the fight for the overall driver and team titles. We lead these standings with Dries Vanthoor, Charles Weerts, and BMW M Team WRT, and we’ll do everything we can to maintain the top position after the finale. In addition, there are numerous other classifications where our drivers and teams are still chasing titles. Jeddah provides a spectacular stage for the finale. The track is new to everyone, and success on this tight street circuit will depend on a strong qualifying and flawless race strategy. The GT4 European Series finale will also be exciting as we compete for the inaugural GT4 Manufacturer ranking title. BMW M Motorsport teams worldwide have contributed to our lead in this new competition with their achievements this season.

Our aim is of course to win the overall championship, and we can also still claim the Endurance Cup but this will be a tough task. It will be the first time that GT cars race in Jeddah. It looks like it is going the be a very tricky track, a very fast street circuit. In theory it should suit our BMW M4 GT3 so let’s see how it goes. We will try our very best.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#32 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, leader overall driver standings): “I am very excited for Jeddah. We still have something in the championship to play for. We will definitely try our best. It’s the first time for everyone to drive on that street track and I think it will be very cool so we are very much looking forward to that. I also think that our BMW M4 GT3 would be quite strong there. It will be a challenge for everyone because nobody has been there yet but we like challenges and I think it’s one of our strengths at BMW M Team WRT to do adapt to new things quickly.

We lead these standings with Dries Vanthoor, Charles Weerts, and BMW M Team WRT, and we’ll do everything we can to maintain the top position after the finale. In addition, there are numerous other classifications where our drivers and teams are still chasing titles. Jeddah provides a spectacular stage for the finale. The track is new to everyone, and success on this tight street circuit will depend on a strong qualifying and flawless race strategy. The GT4 European Series finale will also be exciting as we compete for the inaugural GT4 Manufacturer ranking title. BMW M Motorsport teams worldwide have contributed to our lead in this new competition with their achievements this season. It would be fantastic to celebrate this title together with our customer racing teams.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, leader overall driver standings): “Jeddah marks the final endurance race of the GT World Challenge Europe season and we will try to finish on a high after our podium at Monza. Our aim is of course to win the overall championship, and we can also still claim the Endurance Cup but this will be a tough task. It will be the first time that GT cars race in Jeddah. It looks like it is going the be a very tricky track, a very fast street circuit. In theory it should suit our BMW M4 GT3 so let’s see how it goes. We will try our very best.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#32 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT, leader overall driver standings): “I am very excited for Jeddah. We still have something in the championship to play for. We will definitely try our best. It’s the first time for everyone to drive on that street track and I think it will be very cool so we are very much looking forward to that. I also think that our BMW M4 GT3 would be quite strong there. It will be a challenge for everyone because nobody has been there yet but we like challenges and I think it’s one of our strengths at BMW M Team WRT to do adapt to new things quickly. It will also be the last race of the year for me so for sure we would like to end 2024 on a high.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "GT World Challenge Europe: BMW M4 GT3s hunt for titles at floodlit Jeddah finale."}]}

On Sunday, he improved by eleven places to finish ninth. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) also made it into the top ten in both races. Marco Wittmann (GER) was very unlucky .\n\nRast faced the most significant issues of the three BMW M works drivers in both qualifying sessions and had to start from last position in the races. However, he capitalised on the good race pace of his #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 and made up a total of 24 positions over the weekend. This resulted in a seventh-place finish on Saturday and ninth place on Sunday.\n\nSheldon van der Linde (RSA) fared better in his #31 Shell BMW M4 GT3 during the qualifying, starting from 13th and 10th places. He improved several positions on Saturday, and his eighth place on Sunday was particularly remarkable, as he had to recover from a nearly hopeless position due to a punctured tyre early in the race. He never gave up and managed to fight back into the top ten after a safety car period.\n\nMarco Wittmann (GER) encountered extreme misfortune at the Sachsenring. On Saturday, he was involved in a start collision that damaged the front of his #11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3. Despite the lack of downforce affecting his performance, he managed to finish the race in 13th place. On Sunday, after an excellent first stint from 19th and a promising pit stop, he was within reach of a top-five finish. However, he became an innocent victim of a collision involving Rast and Jordan Pepper (RSA, Lamborghini) behind him, which the race stewards deemed a normal racing incident.\n\nThanks to the strong comebacks, Schubert Motorsport was able to defend its lead in the DTM team standings. With 273 points, the team from Oschersleben (GER) holds a 22-point lead ahead of the remaining race weekends at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) and the Hockenheimring (GER).\n\nComments after the races:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “It's hard to put this DTM race weekend into words. On the plus side, the race pace was very strong for all BMW M4 GT3s. Our drivers managed to overtake the most competitors on the track. Thanks to the fighting spirit and the points scored, things look very good for Schubert Motorsport in the team standings. Unfortunately, our guys lost ground in the drivers' standings. The main reason for this is, of course, the weakness in qualifying. There's a lot of work ahead for the team and drivers in this area, as starting the races from much further ahead would be a big help in the title fight. Marco Wittmann's experience at the Sachsenring painfully showed how quickly accidents can happen when you have to fight through the field.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3): ”It's obviously good to see that our car works well in the races and we can make up a lot of ground, but that's of no use if we can't find the pace in qualifying and have to start from so far back. We definitely need to understand and get a handle on this problem. I'm sorry about the accident on Sunday for Marco and Jordan. I had a good run out of the last corner and wanted to overtake Jordan. When I committed to the inside for the overtaking manoeuvre, he also moved inside, and I hit him. That was very unfortunate, but a racing incident.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 GT3): “I'm very proud of my guys' performance this weekend. I think we got the most out of the possibilities available to us here. There's nothing you can do about a tyre puncture like that; it happens. Nevertheless, we take a lot of positives with us looking forward to the upcoming events.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3): “The weekend was extremely frustrating. When you get hit as hard as I did on Sunday in turn one, there's nothing you can do. That's even more annoying because we were having a very good race up to that point. We had good tyre management and pace and were on a similar strategy to my win at Zandvoort. The plan for the second stint was to keep attacking and maybe even go for the top five. That's why the retirement is brutally disappointing.“"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Schubert Motorsport experienced a rollercoaster ride at the sixth DTM race weekend of the season at the Sachsenring (GER).

On the plus side, the race pace was very strong for all BMW M4 GT3s. Our drivers managed to overtake the most competitors on the track. Thanks to the fighting spirit and the points scored, things look very good for Schubert Motorsport in the team standings. Unfortunately, our guys lost ground in the drivers' standings. The main reason for this is, of course, the weakness in qualifying. There's a lot of work ahead for the team and drivers in this area, as starting the races from much further ahead would be a big help in the title fight. Marco Wittmann's experience at the Sachsenring painfully showed how quickly accidents can happen when you have to fight through the field.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3): ”It's obviously good to see that our car works well in the races and we can make up a lot of ground, but that's of no use if we can't find the pace in qualifying and have to start from so far back. We definitely need to understand and get a handle on this problem. I'm sorry about the accident on Sunday for Marco and Jordan. I had a good run out of the last corner and wanted to overtake Jordan. When I committed to the inside for the overtaking manoeuvre, he also moved inside, and I hit him. That was very unfortunate, but a racing incident.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 GT3): “I'm very proud of my guys' performance this weekend. I think we got the most out of the possibilities available to us here. There's nothing you can do about a tyre puncture like that; it happens. Nevertheless, we take a lot of positives with us looking forward to the upcoming events.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3): “The weekend was extremely frustrating. When you get hit as hard as I did on Sunday in turn one, there's nothing you can do. That's even more annoying because we were having a very good race up to that point. We had good tyre management and pace and were on a similar strategy to my win at Zandvoort. The plan for the second stint was to keep attacking and maybe even go for the top five. That's why the retirement is brutally disappointing.“"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DTM Sachsenring: Hard-fought top-ten results for Schubert Motorsport."}]}

Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) from the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team was the dominant man at the fourth round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). With a perfect weekend on his BMW M 1000 RR at Misano (ITA), he achieved BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s historic first hat-trick in WorldSBK. Starting from pole position, he won all three races of the weekend. In doing so, he impressively fulfilled the goal he had set before the weekend. After these successes, Razgatlioglu leaves Misano as the new world championship leader. His lead over his closest rival is 21 points. At the four race-weekends held so far this season, Razgatlioglu has already achieved six wins and three additional podium finishes with the BMW M 1000 RR. In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW is in second place.\n\nIn Superpole qualification on Saturday morning, Razgatlioglu secured his second pole position of the season with a new lap record. In race one in the afternoon, he briefly fell to second place after the start but regained the lead on lap four and rode away to a dominant victory. After 21 laps, Razgatlioglu had a lead of almost 1.8 seconds over his closest competitor. With that victory, he also took the lead in the riders’ championship. In the Superpole race on Sunday morning, Razgatlioglu again briefly fell back at the start, but soon reclaimed the lead and rode to his next victory, further extending his championship lead. The only race left was the second main race on Sunday afternoon. At the start, Razgatlioglu initially fell back to fifth position, but after a few corners, he was back in second place. From then on, he followed his strategy, steadily closing the gap, resuming the lead on lap eight, and extending it to over five seconds at times. Nothing stood in the way of his third victory of the perfect weekend.\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) was also fast in Superpole qualification but crashed and had to settle for 16th on the grid. In the first race, he worked his way up to eighth place. In the Superpole race, he struggled a bit after the start, but made up positions and finished in 12th place. In the second main race, van der Mark had to retire early due to a technical problem.\n\nIn the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, Garrett Gerloff (USA) qualified in 13th place. In race one, he finished in 12th position. In the Superpole race, Gerloff made an excellent start, finishing the first lap in seventh place which went unrewarded as shortly after he crashed following contact and retired from the race. In race two, he had a minor crash but was able to continue, finishing in 18th place. Scott Redding (GBR) had bad luck with a yellow flag in the Superpole, starting from 20th place in race one. From there, he worked his way up to 15th place to score a point. In the Superpole race, he climbed up to 14th position. In the second main race, he had a strong comeback, finishing in 12th place.\n\nThe fifth round of the WorldSBK 2024 will take place from 12th to 14th July at Donington (GBR).\n\nReactions after the Misano round.\n\nMarc Bongers, Sporting Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I am speechless. It was an absolutely brilliant weekend. We came here with a bit of hope, but to dominate like this at Ducati’s home round was incredible. After the test we had here beforehand, we knew we were in good shape but now we’ve broken all records: lap record, fastest race lap, pole position, three race wins, and we lead the championship with Toprak. I need to let it sink in first. I’ll probably enjoy a pizza with a glass of wine tonight, and maybe tomorrow I’ll realize what happened this weekend. It’s fantastic for the team, fantastic for the brand. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this huge success. It’s a pity that the other guys couldn’t get the results we had hoped for. We showed good pace from yesterday, Mickey was quite strong with eighth place. Garrett had a lot of bad luck, Mickey today, and Scott in the Superpole. We now need to calmly analyse everything and work on getting them further up the field in the next races. The potential is clearly there, as we have shown. But for now, we’ll enjoy this successful weekend.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 1 / R01: 1 / SP Race: 1 / R02: 1): “Before the weekend, I said that it’s my target to get three wins this weekend. Finally I did it. Thank you very much to my team because they did an incredible job this weekend. Especially today, we again improved the bike and I felt more relaxed on it. I really enjoyed the final race especially. It wasn’t an easy race for anyone because of the hot conditions. Everyone was sliding more. But we did a really great job. This is team work because I can not win on my own. Everyone really works hard and now we finally took three wins on a weekend. And it looks like this is just the start. Thanks to everybody!”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 16 / R01: 8 / SP Race: 12 / R02: DNF): “It has been very unfortunate today. In the Superpole race, I had a good start but in turn one I had to take the run-off slip road. It as alright, I managed to gain some places back. Unfortunately on the first lap, I had a get together with another rider so I came back on track last. I pushed as hard as I could to unfortunately only finish 12th. The goal was to be in the top nine in Superpole. I had to start from 16th again in race two; that wasn’t ideal. Initially after the start I was having issues with the bike, and the problems were getting worse and worse, so I had to retire. It’s a shame because I think that over the entire weekend our results did not show the pace I had. Now we have to get everything together and get ready for Donington.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 20 / R01: 15 / SP Race: 14 / R02: 12): “Today was a little bit better than the rest of the weekend. Warm up was good, we made some changes on the bike that actually helped. In the Superpole race those changes we made felt like we needed to go more in that direction we did for race two. Superpole race was ok, but the lap time was not really there so we made those changes to help me for race two. The biggest problem I faced this weekend was the yellow flag in qualifying which set me in 20th position for the start of the race because the start is like a casino, there are bikes all over the place. Anyway, I was happy with the feeling from the bike in race two, I felt stronger and felt like we are going in the right direction. I hope now, that we can start well in Donington and start working with the bike on that feeling that I’m looking for and then we can make better steps.“\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 13 / R01: 12 / SP Race: DNF / R02: 18): “This is not the way I wanted to end the weekend and it wasn’t the weekend I wanted to have.

It’s fantastic for the team, fantastic for the brand. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this huge success. It’s a pity that the other guys couldn’t get the results we had hoped for. We showed good pace from yesterday, Mickey was quite strong with eighth place. Garrett had a lot of bad luck, Mickey today, and Scott in the Superpole.

The biggest problem I faced this weekend was the yellow flag in qualifying which set me in 20th position for the start of the race because the start is like a casino, there are bikes all over the place. Anyway, I was happy with the feeling from the bike in race two, I felt stronger and felt like we are going in the right direction. I hope now, that we can start well in Donington and start working with the bike on that feeling that I’m looking for and then we can make better steps.“\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 13 / R01: 12 / SP Race: DNF / R02: 18): “This is not the way I wanted to end the weekend and it wasn’t the weekend I wanted to have.

With a perfect weekend on his BMW M 1000 RR at Misano (ITA), he achieved BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s historic first hat-trick in WorldSBK. Starting from pole position, he won all three races of the weekend. In doing so, he impressively fulfilled the goal he had set before the weekend.

In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW is in second place.\n\nIn Superpole qualification on Saturday morning, Razgatlioglu secured his second pole position of the season with a new lap record. In race one in the afternoon, he briefly fell to second place after the start but regained the lead on lap four and rode away to a dominant victory. After 21 laps, Razgatlioglu had a lead of almost 1.8 seconds over his closest competitor. With that victory, he also took the lead in the riders’ championship.

Nothing stood in the way of his third victory of the perfect weekend.\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) was also fast in Superpole qualification but crashed and had to settle for 16th on the grid. In the first race, he worked his way up to eighth place. In the Superpole race, he struggled a bit after the start, but made up positions and finished in 12th place.

In race two, he had a minor crash but was able to continue, finishing in 18th place. Scott Redding (GBR) had bad luck with a yellow flag in the Superpole, starting from 20th place in race one.

Finishing second and third, they also made it onto the overall podium both times. Verhagen, as at Sebring (USA), had once again secured pole position in his qualifying session. BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Justin Rothberg (both USA) finished second in the Pro-Am category in their Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3 in the second race. Third place in the Pro class went to the ST Racing duo Bill Auberlen and Varun Choksey (both USA) in both runs.\n\nGT/GT4/TC America (17th-19th May): Victories for the BMW M4 GT4 and the BMW M2 CS Racing.\n\nIn GT4 America, the victory in the Endurance race at the Circuit of the Americas went to the #97 BMW M4 GT4 from Random Vandals Racing. Kevin Boehm and Kenton Koch (both USA) had more than a half-minute lead over their competitors after 74 laps. In the Pro-Am and Am classes, victory also went to a BMW M4 GT4. James Walker Jr. and Tyler McQuarrie (both USA) triumphed for the BimmerWorld team in the Pro-Am category. In the Am class, Paul Sparta and Kris Wilson (both USA) from Random Vandals Racing and Nicholas Shanny and Chris Walsh (both USA) from Carrus Callas Raceteam even secured a one-two result for the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nIn TC America, Chris Walsh once again set the standard. He won both races in Austin in the Carrus Callas Raceteam BMW M2 CS Racing car. Second place in both runs went to Lucas Catania (USA) from Team Rigid Speed. In the first race, Aaron Kaplan (USA) from Kaplan Racing Systems completed the 1-2-3 for the BMW M2 CS Racing.\n\nIn GT America, Justin Rothberg competed for Turner Motorsport in the BMW M4 GT3. He finished in fifth and fourth place, narrowly missing the podium each time.\n\nGT4 European Series (17th-19th May): Lessennes and van der Ende win at Misano.\n\nBenjamin Lessennes (BEL) and Ricardo van der Ende (NED) celebrated their first season victory in the GT4 European Series at Misano (ITA). In the second race, the Belgian-Dutch duo from Team L'Espace Bienvenue triumphed in the #17 BMW M4 GT4 after a real thriller in the Silver Class. Third place went to Yağiz Gedik (TUR) and Pedro Ebrahim Carvalho (BRA) in the #11 BMW M4 GT4, completing the double podium for BMW M Motorsport on Sunday. The day before, there was reason to celebrate in the Pro-Am category when Gregory Guilvert and Antoni de Barn (both FRA) finished third in the #317 BMW M4 GT4, thus celebrating the class podium for Team Chazel Technologie Course in Emilia-Romagna on Saturday.\n\nESL R1 (17th-19th May): BMW M Team Redline and Bennett win the opener.\n\nThe 2024 season is also picking up speed on the virtual racetrack for BMW M Motorsport. On Friday, the second edition of the ESL R1 Championship started with its first event at the Daytona International Speedway. The three BMW M Teams BS+COMPETITION, MOUZ, and Redline are competing in a total of six events on the \"Rennsport\" simulation platform for prize money totaling 500,000 US dollars. The grand finale will take place at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh (KSA) at the end of August. At the start of the season, two drivers at the wheel of virtual BMW M4 GT3s made it to the final of the last twelve. The victory went to Luke Bennett (GBR) while his Team Redline team-mate and last year's champion Sebastian Job (GBR) reached fifth place. The second round of the Team Championship will take place next Friday.\n\niRacing 24h Nürburgring (17th-19th May): Triumph for BMW M Team Redline with F1 champion in a double role.\n\nFor the fourth time in the last five races, victory at the iRacing 24h Nürburgring event went to an official BMW M Team. After 24 hours, this time BMW M Team Redline with drivers Chris Lulham (GBR), Diogo Pinto (POR), Max Verstappen (NED), and Florian Lebigre (FRA) triumphed at the virtual \"Green Hell.\" The quartet drove a flawless race and controlled the action from the lead early on. It looked like BMW M Team BS+COMPETITION could secure a 1-2 for BMW M Teams, but an accident for the \"Zebras\" early on Sunday morning dashed all podium chances. Curiously, Verstappen was competing simultaneously at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at Imola (ITA), where he secured pole position and the race win. For him and BMW M Team Redline, it was the second overall victory at this event after 2021.\n\nESET Cup Series (17th-19th May): Victories and podium finishes at the Red Bull Ring.\n\nThe second race weekend of the ESET Cup Series at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) ended with a GT3 class victory for Antal Zsigo (SVK) in the Trevor Racing #500 BMW M4 GT3 and additional podium finishes. Zsigo finished third overall in the second sprint race, which meant first place in his class. In the first sprint race, Zsigo finished second in the GT3 category. For Gregor Zsigo (SVK), who competed in the BMW M6 GT3, second place in the Endurance and third in the second sprint race were recorded. In the GT4 class, Rudolf Beňo (SVK) finished second in both sprint races with his Aries Racing BMW M4 GT4. He achieved the same result alongside team-mate Richard Gonda (SVK) in the Endurance race.\n\nGT4 France (10th-12th May): Second season event at Lédenon.\n\nAt the second race weekend of GT4 France at Lédenon (FRA), BMW M Motorsport teams narrowly missed the overall podium. In the first race, Carla Debard and Simon Gachet (both FRA) in the BMW M4 GT4 from Debard Automobiles By Racetivity finished fourth. The same position was achieved in the second race by Natan Bihel and Paul Lanchere (both FRA) from VSF Sports - Amplitude automobiles. Two podium finishes were celebrated for the team in the Am class. Gregory Curson Faessel and Florian Teillais (both FRA) finished second and third in their BMW M4 GT4s.\n\nBTCC (10th-12th May): Dominant double victory for Colin Turkington.\n\nColin Turkington (GBR) and Team BMW experienced an almost perfect weekend at the second round of the British Touring Car Championship 2024 (BTCC) on the short Indy Circuit at Brands Hatch (GBR). First, Turkington secured pole position in the #20 BMW 330e M Sport, then followed up with dominant victories in the first two races. In the first run, he finished almost seven seconds ahead of the rest of the field, and in the second race, his lead was over three seconds despite a safety car period. Turkington had to start the third race from eleventh due to the partially reversed starting order and finished eighth. As the driver who collected the most points over the weekend, he moved up to second place in the championship standings.\n\nTurkington’s Team BMW team-mate, Adam Morgan (GBR), finished fourth in the second race, and outside the top-10 in the other two. Jake Hill (GBR) from Team Laser Tools Racing with MB Motorsport managed a comeback from twelfth to fourth place in the first race. In the second race, he retired with damaged steering after several ramming incidents by competitors. He thus had to start from the back in the third race but still managed to finish twelfth. In the drivers' standings, Turkington is second after two of ten race events of the season, Hill is fourth with Morgan tenth. In the manufacturers' standings, BMW continues to lead."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport, M Motorsport Newsletter, GT Racing, Customer Racing"}]}

Like many sectors of the global economy, we are adjusting to a new reality – one in which abrupt changes in external conditions often have far-reaching consequences, not just for our industry.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is critical not to get caught up in the public frenzy or rush into hasty actions. That is why we continue to focus on our long-term strategic course with pragmatism and flexibility.\n\nAnd this approach is proving its value: Despite the volatile conditions, the BMW Group has started 2025 in line with our expectations.\n\nThere are three main reasons for this:\n\nFirst, our fresh and attractive product line-up across all drive technologies – which helped us achieve a robust performance, especially in Europe and the US.\n\nSecond, continued strong sales growth for our all-electric vehicles.\n\nAnd, third, a high standard of cost discipline across the company.\n\nAll of this meant that, despite various influencing factors, our profitability for the first quarter was in the upper half of our guidance.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the details:\n\nIn all major sales regions outside of China, we increased our sales, compared to the same period of last year. Excluding China, sales grew by almost six percent (5.9%).\n\nThis confirms the effectiveness not only of our product strategy, but also of our technology-open approach. Our vehicles are in demand, across all types of drivetrain.\n\nWe saw particularly good growth in Europe and the US – with sales in Europe up solidly by more than six percent and an increase of four percent in the US.\n\nWe are growing steadily across the entire Americas region, with growth of over 5 percent. We are also growing overall in our markets outside Europe, America, and China by 15 percent. Thanks to our strong performance in other markets, we were able to nearly offset the persistent challenges in the Chinese market.\n\nWe have the right products on the market at the right time. Our wide range of all-electric vehicles across all brands allows us to take full advantage of the growing demand for pure electric vehicles.\n\nThe more than 32-percent increase in BEV sales underlines the strong appeal of our electric vehicles. Above all, high demand in Europe fuelled this growth in BEVs. Here, sales of fully-electric vehicles climbed by more than 64 percent year-on-year. E-mobility “made by BMW” is also gaining popularity in the US, with sales up by more than 23 percent.\n\nNearly one in five vehicles sold by the BMW Group is now fully-electric.\n\nThe total share of electrified vehicles – that is, pure electric cars plus plug-in hybrids – now exceeds 25 percent.\n\nMINI, in particular, is benefiting from the strong demand for all-electric vehicles. Today, an electric heart beats in one out of every three vehicles built by the brand. With all models of the New MINI Family now fully available, the brand recorded sales growth of four percent. In China, locally-built electric models played a key role in the brand’s growth of over 18 percent.\n\nThe share of fully-electric vehicles in total sales is especially important for meeting European CO2 targets. In 2024, the BMW Group once again significantly outperformed its European CO2 fleet target. Based on internal calculations, our numbers came in at under 100 grammes per kilometre in the WLTP cycle for the first time. We are confident that we will meet the original legal requirements this year as well.\n\nIn addition to the growth in all-electric vehicles, we also benefited from continued high demand for our sporty BMW M models – with sales up 5 percent in the first quarter. High-performance models such as the two BMW M5* variants and the BMW M3* were the main growth drivers.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe first quarter of 2025 highlighted our company’s ability to seize opportunities in a challenging environment and to successfully defend our position in the marketplace.\n\nLooking ahead, new orders across all drive technologies give us every reason for confidence – especially in Germany, where we are seeing significant growth.\n\nNevertheless, 2025 remains a year of high volatility. We are closely monitoring developments and preparing for different scenarios. This will enable us to respond flexibly and quickly to changing circumstances. We remain firmly committed to deliver robust results and to meet our ambitious annual targets.\n\nFree trade and international cooperation are important drivers of growth and progress. They have always guided our actions. In trade conflicts, on the other hand, nobody wins. All sides should therefore avoid a spiral of isolation and trade barriers, and instead promote growth, progress and innovation worldwide.\n\nWe are advocating for this at various political levels in our markets. Thanks to our international footprint and strong, long-term commitment in various countries, we enjoy a high level of credibility. That is why people listen to us attentively and our arguments are well received.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIt is especially important in challenging times that we continually assess the situation in our markets and regions. That is why I have spent significant time in the past few months gathering information about the situation on the ground in our most important markets.\n\nJust two weeks ago, I was at Auto Shanghai. This trade show provides a valuable indicator for current trends – especially for the Chinese market.\n\nOne of the highlights was the world premiere of our BMW Vision Driving Experience, or VDX for short. This is the most powerful development prototype BMW has ever built. The key data speaks for itself:\n\nThese are the kind of numbers you usually only see in top-of-the-range racing cars.\n\nThe VDX is a pure test vehicle, designed to push the limits of driving physics. However, many of its technologies will be used in our NEUE KLASSE.\n\nIn particular, the VDX showcases the performance capabilities of our “Heart of Joy” – one of four high-performance computers that will control key functionalities, such as driving dynamics, automated driving and infotainment in our NEUE KLASSE.\n\nThe “Heart of Joy” clusters all drivetrain and driving dynamics functions in a single, standardised electronic control unit. In combination with our dynamic performance control system – which was developed entirely in-house – we are redefining the BMW brand’s most fundamental core characteristic.\n\nWe are creating “the next level of Sheer Driving Pleasure”.\n\nWe demonstrated exactly what this means with an incredible live performance in Shanghai. For this purpose, we built our own test track with a massive ramp.\n\nThe public and trade press were more than impressed with the performance and possibilities unleashed when we combine our decades of experience in driving dynamics with cutting-edge control technology. This is something only we at BMW can do.\n\nOur customers will benefit directly from this – because a system that can manage forces like these can also handle everyday operations with ease: not just in terms of agility and driving stability, but also efficiency and comfort.\n\nTowards the end of the year, series production of the NEUE KLASSE will begin at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary – starting with the BMW iX3*, which will celebrate its world premiere at the IAA MOBILITY in Munich.\n\nAfter that, the rollout will continue in rapid succession. In 2026, production of a sporty sedan at the heart of the BMW brand will get underway at our main plant in Munich.\n\nWe are deliberately launching the NEUE KLASSE in high-volume segments, so that our innovations can immediately have a broad impact.\n\nBetween now and 2027, we will release more than 40 new or updated BMW models onto the market – from BEVs, to plug-in hybrids, to vehicles with combustion engines. All of these will benefit from the technologies of the NEUE KLASSE – and, of course, from the new design language as well.\n\nNo other manufacturer has a project as comprehensive and ground-breaking as ours ready for production.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWith its broad product portfolio across all brands, its technology-open approach and highly flexible production network, the BMW Group is in an excellent position to exploit growth opportunities as they arise.\n\nThanks to our global footprint, we are also able to respond quickly to changes in individual regions, as well as challenges around the world.\n\nWe will continue to build on these typical BMW strengths in future.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Limousine: energy consumption combined: 26,8 kWh/100 km and 1,9 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions eighted combined: 43 g/km (WLTP); CO2 class: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B BMW M5 Touring: energy consumption weighted combined: 27,6 kWh/100 km and 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B BMW M3 Competition Limousine mit M xDrive: energy consumption combined: 10,2–10,1 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions combined: 230–228 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: G BMW iX1 eDrive20: energy consumption combined: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2 class: A"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Conference Call Quarterly Statement to 31 March 2025"}]}

That is why I have spent significant time in the past few months gathering information about the situation on the ground in our most important markets.\n\nJust two weeks ago, I was at Auto Shanghai. This trade show provides a valuable indicator for current trends – especially for the Chinese market.\n\nOne of the highlights was the world premiere of our BMW Vision Driving Experience, or VDX for short. This is the most powerful development prototype BMW has ever built. The key data speaks for itself:\n\nThese are the kind of numbers you usually only see in top-of-the-range racing cars.\n\nThe VDX is a pure test vehicle, designed to push the limits of driving physics. However, many of its technologies will be used in our NEUE KLASSE.\n\nIn particular, the VDX showcases the performance capabilities of our “Heart of Joy” – one of four high-performance computers that will control key functionalities, such as driving dynamics, automated driving and infotainment in our NEUE KLASSE.\n\nThe “Heart of Joy” clusters all drivetrain and driving dynamics functions in a single, standardised electronic control unit. In combination with our dynamic performance control system – which was developed entirely in-house – we are redefining the BMW brand’s most fundamental core characteristic.\n\nWe are creating “the next level of Sheer Driving Pleasure”.\n\nWe demonstrated exactly what this means with an incredible live performance in Shanghai. For this purpose, we built our own test track with a massive ramp.\n\nThe public and trade press were more than impressed with the performance and possibilities unleashed when we combine our decades of experience in driving dynamics with cutting-edge control technology. This is something only we at BMW can do.\n\nOur customers will benefit directly from this – because a system that can manage forces like these can also handle everyday operations with ease: not just in terms of agility and driving stability, but also efficiency and comfort.\n\nTowards the end of the year, series production of the NEUE KLASSE will begin at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary – starting with the BMW iX3*, which will celebrate its world premiere at the IAA MOBILITY in Munich.\n\nAfter that, the rollout will continue in rapid succession. In 2026, production of a sporty sedan at the heart of the BMW brand will get underway at our main plant in Munich.\n\nWe are deliberately launching the NEUE KLASSE in high-volume segments, so that our innovations can immediately have a broad impact.\n\nBetween now and 2027, we will release more than 40 new or updated BMW models onto the market – from BEVs, to plug-in hybrids, to vehicles with combustion engines. All of these will benefit from the technologies of the NEUE KLASSE – and, of course, from the new design language as well.\n\nNo other manufacturer has a project as comprehensive and ground-breaking as ours ready for production.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWith its broad product portfolio across all brands, its technology-open approach and highly flexible production network, the BMW Group is in an excellent position to exploit growth opportunities as they arise.\n\nThanks to our global footprint, we are also able to respond quickly to changes in individual regions, as well as challenges around the world.\n\nWe will continue to build on these typical BMW strengths in future.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Limousine: energy consumption combined: 26,8 kWh/100 km and 1,9 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions eighted combined: 43 g/km (WLTP); CO2 class: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B BMW M5 Touring: energy consumption weighted combined: 27,6 kWh/100 km and 2 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 45 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B BMW M3 Competition Limousine mit M xDrive: energy consumption combined: 10,2–10,1 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions combined: 230–228 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: G BMW iX1 eDrive20: energy consumption combined: 15,4 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2 class: A"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Conference Call Quarterly Statement to 31 March 2025"}]}

Like many sectors of the global economy, we are adjusting to a new reality – one in which abrupt changes in external conditions often have far-reaching consequences, not just for our industry.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is critical not to get caught up in the public frenzy or rush into hasty actions. That is why we continue to focus on our long-term strategic course with pragmatism and flexibility.\n\nAnd this approach is proving its value: Despite the volatile conditions, the BMW Group has started 2025 in line with our expectations.\n\nThere are three main reasons for this:\n\nFirst, our fresh and attractive product line-up across all drive technologies – which helped us achieve a robust performance, especially in Europe and the US.\n\nSecond, continued strong sales growth for our all-electric vehicles.\n\nAnd, third, a high standard of cost discipline across the company.\n\nAll of this meant that, despite various influencing factors, our profitability for the first quarter was in the upper half of our guidance.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the details:\n\nIn all major sales regions outside of China, we increased our sales, compared to the same period of last year. Excluding China, sales grew by almost six percent (5.9%).\n\nThis confirms the effectiveness not only of our product strategy, but also of our technology-open approach. Our vehicles are in demand, across all types of drivetrain.\n\nWe saw particularly good growth in Europe and the US – with sales in Europe up solidly by more than six percent and an increase of four percent in the US.\n\nWe are growing steadily across the entire Americas region, with growth of over 5 percent. We are also growing overall in our markets outside Europe, America, and China by 15 percent. Thanks to our strong performance in other markets, we were able to nearly offset the persistent challenges in the Chinese market.\n\nWe have the right products on the market at the right time. Our wide range of all-electric vehicles across all brands allows us to take full advantage of the growing demand for pure electric vehicles.\n\nThe more than 32-percent increase in BEV sales underlines the strong appeal of our electric vehicles. Above all, high demand in Europe fuelled this growth in BEVs. Here, sales of fully-electric vehicles climbed by more than 64 percent year-on-year. E-mobility “made by BMW” is also gaining popularity in the US, with sales up by more than 23 percent.\n\nNearly one in five vehicles sold by the BMW Group is now fully-electric.\n\nThe total share of electrified vehicles – that is, pure electric cars plus plug-in hybrids – now exceeds 25 percent.\n\nMINI, in particular, is benefiting from the strong demand for all-electric vehicles. Today, an electric heart beats in one out of every three vehicles built by the brand. With all models of the New MINI Family now fully available, the brand recorded sales growth of four percent. In China, locally-built electric models played a key role in the brand’s growth of over 18 percent.\n\nThe share of fully-electric vehicles in total sales is especially important for meeting European CO2 targets. In 2024, the BMW Group once again significantly outperformed its European CO2 fleet target. Based on internal calculations, our numbers came in at under 100 grammes per kilometre in the WLTP cycle for the first time. We are confident that we will meet the original legal requirements this year as well.\n\nIn addition to the growth in all-electric vehicles, we also benefited from continued high demand for our sporty BMW M models – with sales up 5 percent in the first quarter. High-performance models such as the two BMW M5* variants and the BMW M3* were the main growth drivers.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe first quarter of 2025 highlighted our company’s ability to seize opportunities in a challenging environment and to successfully defend our position in the marketplace.\n\nLooking ahead, new orders across all drive technologies give us every reason for confidence – especially in Germany, where we are seeing significant growth.\n\nNevertheless, 2025 remains a year of high volatility. We are closely monitoring developments and preparing for different scenarios. This will enable us to respond flexibly and quickly to changing circumstances. We remain firmly committed to deliver robust results and to meet our ambitious annual targets.\n\nFree trade and international cooperation are important drivers of growth and progress. They have always guided our actions. In trade conflicts, on the other hand, nobody wins. All sides should therefore avoid a spiral of isolation and trade barriers, and instead promote growth, progress and innovation worldwide.\n\nWe are advocating for this at various political levels in our markets. Thanks to our international footprint and strong, long-term commitment in various countries, we enjoy a high level of credibility.

The award trophy was designed by BMW Group Designworks for the first time.Munich/Berlin. On the evening of 4 June 2024, Pan Daijing, Dan Lie, Hanne Lippard and James Richards were awarded the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2024 at Hamburger Bahnhof - Nationalgalerie der Gegenwart. The artistic positions will be shown at Hamburger Bahnhof in a group exhibition and will subsequently become part of the Nationalgalerie's collection. The exhibition opens on 7 June with three admission-free open days. The BMW Group Cultural Engagement has been supporting the Preis der Nationalgalerie as main partner since 2006. In the presence of Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate, the trophies, designed for the first time by BMW Group Designworks, were handed over at the festive award ceremony.\n\nThe positions of Pan Daijing, Dan Lie, Hanne Lippard and James Richards form a lively dialogue with the contemporary art scene in Germany. With four newly commissioned works that will be included in the Nationalgalerie's collection, the prize supports the artists' development at an important stage in their careers. Each of the four has conceived a space that expresses different aspects of their multi-layered practice. The four installations interact with the architecture of the exhibition spaces in different ways, for example through sound, light, moving images and biological matter.\n\n“I am thrilled that BMW has been a partner of the Preis der Nationalgalerie for many years. This collaboration is particularly close to our hearts because it supports young and talented artists who change and enrich our view of the world. The Preis der Nationalgalerie stands for innovation, creativity and cultural diversity - values that are also deeply rooted in the BMW Group.

With two world championships, two factory teams, six factory riders, a new generation of the BMW M 1000 RR, and a big racing family, BMW Motorrad Motorsport officially kicked off the 2025 season in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) and the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) with a season launch event in Berlin (GER). At BMW Motorrad Welt, located next to the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin-Spandau, the teams and riders unveiled their new bikes for the upcoming season: the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team with World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and Michael van der Mark (NED), as well as the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with Markus Reiterberger (GER), Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), new addition Steven Odendaal (RSA), and Hannes Soomer (EST).\n\n“It’s fantastic to kick off the season together with our entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory family from both world championships, and to do so in the perfect location, BMW Motorrad Welt. This is where the heart of BMW Motorrad production beats, and it is also the home of our racing engines,” said Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport. “We are still in the middle of a busy winter break, but the anticipation for the season grows with each passing day. In WorldSBK, we will see the new BMW M 1000 RR carrying number one, and after winning the title with Toprak last season, the goal is, of course, to become World Champion again. The same applies to the FIM EWC. We’ve stood on the championship podium several times before, and now we want to reach the top step. We are working hard with our teams and riders to achieve these ambitious goals.”\n\nIn WorldSBK, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, led by Team Principal Shaun Muir, will field the new M RR. World Champion Razgatlioglu is entering his second year with the team after an exceptional debut season with BMW Motorrad Motorsport. For van der Mark, this marks his fifth season as a BMW Motorrad factory rider. The WorldSBK season kicks off with the first races on 22nd and 23rd February at Phillip Island (AUS).\n\nThe BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, led by Werner Daemen, secured third place overall in the 2024 FIM EWC standings. Reiterberger, a veteran of the team, has been part of the project since its debut season in 2019/20. For Guintoli and Soomer, it’s their second season with the team, while Odendaal joins as a new addition this year. The first race, the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), is scheduled for 19th to 20th April.\n\nJoining the stage live at the Season Launch were two well-known members of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport road racing family: Isle of Man winners Peter Hickman and Davey Todd (both GBR), who will race together for FHO Racing BMW in international road races and the British Superbike Championship in 2025.\n\nMore quotes from the Season Launch:\n\nChristian Gonschor (Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport): “I am very excited about the new season, and today’s event showed that the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport and BMW Group are fully behind this. We had both factory racing programmes here, and there couldn’t have been a better way to start the year. The riders were happy, the fans were thrilled, and we as technicians and engineers were as well. The new BMW M 1000 RR is an outstanding foundation for the future. The goal remains, as always, to be successful and to approach every race with full focus. Naturally, we aim to defend the title in WorldSBK. We are now the ones to beat, which presents a challenge for any manufacturer as competitors grow stronger – but so will we. In the Endurance World Championship, we also aim to win the title, and I think that in 2025, with the new motorcycle, the new rider lineup, and the complete team package, we are very well positioned to succeed in endurance racing as well.”\n\nShaun Muir (Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It is great to be here in Berlin. It has been twelve months since we set off the project with Toprak and Michael as a pairing. It is fantastic to see the new 2025 BMW M 1000 RR in the new paint scheme. It’s looking really good. We are just happy that it is now January, pre-season testing starts in one week’s time and then we are quickly off to Australia. The expectations are very high because of the successes both Michael and Toprak had last year. We would like to get one step further for sure to get the manufacturers’ and riders’ championship and also Michael in the top three or four in the World Championship would be sensational. The test team have done everything possible to give us the tools to do the job and we are excited to go to the track. It has been great to be here, to see all the fans, the sponsors and we are looking forward to start the season.”\n\nWerner Daemen (Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “It was a great season launch. BMW Motorrad Welt is a fantastic location, and it’s always amazing to be here at the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin, where our engines are built. It’s great to see how the employees work here and how professional everything is. I’m also very happy that we presented ourselves with our new motorcycle here. We’ve started the year off great, and as the saying goes, if something starts well, it will end well. We can’t wait to get the new season underway. We are well-prepared with a strong bike and a great rider line-up that has already synced up perfectly during the first test.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#1 BMW M 1000 RR, WorldSBK): “It was the second time we did the launch in Berlin and it was even better than last year. Everyone was really happy because now we came here as World Champion. It was exciting. We will now head into the new season. Everyone will see the number one on my bike. In general I am happy. It looks like we are ready to start the season. I hope that we can achieve a lot of success this year, especially together with Mickey. Thank you very much to everyone for the support!”\n\nMichael van der Mark (#60 BMW M 1000 RR, WorldSBK): “It was nice to be here after one year. In this last year, we could see that a lot of people became fans of not just Toprak but of BMW and our entire WorldSBK project. It’s fantastic to be here, and it’s nice to start the season that way. Everything is looking fantastic and now I just want to race the bike. We finished last season so strong with the double podium, I think this is where we should start. I want to get as many podiums as possible. I think the ultimate dream of everyone in the team is to have the riders’, the teams’ and of course the manufacturers’ championship. That would be a nice goal and if we continue like last year, it should be possible.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “The days in Berlin were fantastic. Seeing the plant and also BMW Motorrad Welt is always interesting. The team presentation was something special; there were so many people present, and it is of great importance for us to be introduced together with the WorldSBK team. That gives us an extra boost heading into the new season. It has further strengthened our goal of winning races and securing the title.“\n\nSylvain Guintoli (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been pretty amazing here in Berlin. It is first time here and visiting the factory, seeing how the bikes are being built, the way things are organised, was mindblowing. It has been great for us as the World Endurance project to be officially presented with the WorldSBK effort. There is a really nice vibe about the BMW Motorrad Motorsport programme and it was a pleasure to be here. I enjoyed every second and I can’t wait for the season to start now because with the new bike, the 2025 model, we are confident that we have a package we can win races. I am looking forward to the first race.”\n\nSteven Odendaal (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been a really warm welcome from the team and the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport family. I really enjoyed it. It is a fantastic environment and it has also been a great launch. It brought all the people together and we had really great time. I enjoyed seeing the BMW Motorrad plant as well. I saw all the details and the quality that goes into building this machine for us. So it was very nice to meet all the guys who are building our machines before the season and I am super ready for what’s to come this year. Everything is looking really good and now it’s out time to do our part on track and give it full gas.”\n\nHannes Soomer (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been a great event. I am proud to be part of this family and proud to be here. I am looking forward to the season. My role in the team is to support these three guys to fight for the World Championship. This means that I will do what they need. From my selfish side, I have the most experienced guys in World Endurance in my box so I will learn as much as possible and hopefully step in one of their shoes in the future.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With two world championships, two factory teams, six factory riders, a new generation of the BMW M 1000 RR, and a big racing family, BMW Motorrad Motorsport officially kicked off the 2025 season in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) and the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) with a season launch event in Berlin (GER)."}]}

I am looking forward to the first race.”\n\nSteven Odendaal (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been a really warm welcome from the team and the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport family. I really enjoyed it. It is a fantastic environment and it has also been a great launch. It brought all the people together and we had really great time. I enjoyed seeing the BMW Motorrad plant as well. I saw all the details and the quality that goes into building this machine for us. So it was very nice to meet all the guys who are building our machines before the season and I am super ready for what’s to come this year. Everything is looking really good and now it’s out time to do our part on track and give it full gas.”\n\nHannes Soomer (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been a great event. I am proud to be part of this family and proud to be here. I am looking forward to the season. My role in the team is to support these three guys to fight for the World Championship. This means that I will do what they need. From my selfish side, I have the most experienced guys in World Endurance in my box so I will learn as much as possible and hopefully step in one of their shoes in the future.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Motorcycle Sports, FIM EWC, Superbike Championship"}]}

With two world championships, two factory teams, six factory riders, a new generation of the BMW M 1000 RR, and a big racing family, BMW Motorrad Motorsport officially kicked off the 2025 season in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) and the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) with a season launch event in Berlin (GER). At BMW Motorrad Welt, located next to the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin-Spandau, the teams and riders unveiled their new bikes for the upcoming season: the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team with World Champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and Michael van der Mark (NED), as well as the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with Markus Reiterberger (GER), Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), new addition Steven Odendaal (RSA), and Hannes Soomer (EST).\n\n“It’s fantastic to kick off the season together with our entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory family from both world championships, and to do so in the perfect location, BMW Motorrad Welt. This is where the heart of BMW Motorrad production beats, and it is also the home of our racing engines,” said Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport. “We are still in the middle of a busy winter break, but the anticipation for the season grows with each passing day. In WorldSBK, we will see the new BMW M 1000 RR carrying number one, and after winning the title with Toprak last season, the goal is, of course, to become World Champion again. The same applies to the FIM EWC. We’ve stood on the championship podium several times before, and now we want to reach the top step. We are working hard with our teams and riders to achieve these ambitious goals.”\n\nIn WorldSBK, the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, led by Team Principal Shaun Muir, will field the new M RR. World Champion Razgatlioglu is entering his second year with the team after an exceptional debut season with BMW Motorrad Motorsport. For van der Mark, this marks his fifth season as a BMW Motorrad factory rider. The WorldSBK season kicks off with the first races on 22nd and 23rd February at Phillip Island (AUS).\n\nThe BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, led by Werner Daemen, secured third place overall in the 2024 FIM EWC standings. Reiterberger, a veteran of the team, has been part of the project since its debut season in 2019/20. For Guintoli and Soomer, it’s their second season with the team, while Odendaal joins as a new addition this year. The first race, the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), is scheduled for 19th to 20th April.\n\nJoining the stage live at the Season Launch were two well-known members of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport road racing family: Isle of Man winners Peter Hickman and Davey Todd (both GBR), who will race together for FHO Racing BMW in international road races and the British Superbike Championship in 2025.\n\nMore quotes from the Season Launch:\n\nChristian Gonschor (Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport): “I am very excited about the new season, and today’s event showed that the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport and BMW Group are fully behind this. We had both factory racing programmes here, and there couldn’t have been a better way to start the year. The riders were happy, the fans were thrilled, and we as technicians and engineers were as well. The new BMW M 1000 RR is an outstanding foundation for the future. The goal remains, as always, to be successful and to approach every race with full focus. Naturally, we aim to defend the title in WorldSBK. We are now the ones to beat, which presents a challenge for any manufacturer as competitors grow stronger – but so will we. In the Endurance World Championship, we also aim to win the title, and I think that in 2025, with the new motorcycle, the new rider lineup, and the complete team package, we are very well positioned to succeed in endurance racing as well.”\n\nShaun Muir (Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “It is great to be here in Berlin. It has been twelve months since we set off the project with Toprak and Michael as a pairing. It is fantastic to see the new 2025 BMW M 1000 RR in the new paint scheme. It’s looking really good. We are just happy that it is now January, pre-season testing starts in one week’s time and then we are quickly off to Australia. The expectations are very high because of the successes both Michael and Toprak had last year. We would like to get one step further for sure to get the manufacturers’ and riders’ championship and also Michael in the top three or four in the World Championship would be sensational. The test team have done everything possible to give us the tools to do the job and we are excited to go to the track. It has been great to be here, to see all the fans, the sponsors and we are looking forward to start the season.”\n\nWerner Daemen (Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “It was a great season launch. BMW Motorrad Welt is a fantastic location, and it’s always amazing to be here at the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin, where our engines are built. It’s great to see how the employees work here and how professional everything is. I’m also very happy that we presented ourselves with our new motorcycle here. We’ve started the year off great, and as the saying goes, if something starts well, it will end well. We can’t wait to get the new season underway. We are well-prepared with a strong bike and a great rider line-up that has already synced up perfectly during the first test.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#1 BMW M 1000 RR, WorldSBK): “It was the second time we did the launch in Berlin and it was even better than last year. Everyone was really happy because now we came here as World Champion. It was exciting. We will now head into the new season. Everyone will see the number one on my bike. In general I am happy. It looks like we are ready to start the season. I hope that we can achieve a lot of success this year, especially together with Mickey. Thank you very much to everyone for the support!”\n\nMichael van der Mark (#60 BMW M 1000 RR, WorldSBK): “It was nice to be here after one year. In this last year, we could see that a lot of people became fans of not just Toprak but of BMW and our entire WorldSBK project. It’s fantastic to be here, and it’s nice to start the season that way. Everything is looking fantastic and now I just want to race the bike. We finished last season so strong with the double podium, I think this is where we should start. I want to get as many podiums as possible. I think the ultimate dream of everyone in the team is to have the riders’, the teams’ and of course the manufacturers’ championship. That would be a nice goal and if we continue like last year, it should be possible.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “The days in Berlin were fantastic. Seeing the plant and also BMW Motorrad Welt is always interesting. The team presentation was something special; there were so many people present, and it is of great importance for us to be introduced together with the WorldSBK team. That gives us an extra boost heading into the new season. It has further strengthened our goal of winning races and securing the title.“\n\nSylvain Guintoli (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, FIM EWC): “It has been pretty amazing here in Berlin. It is first time here and visiting the factory, seeing how the bikes are being built, the way things are organised, was mindblowing. It has been great for us as the World Endurance project to be officially presented with the WorldSBK effort. There is a really nice vibe about the BMW Motorrad Motorsport programme and it was a pleasure to be here. I enjoyed every second and I can’t wait for the season to start now because with the new bike, the 2025 model, we are confident that we have a package we can win races.

In addition, the company supports the biathlon team with its technological expertise to aerodynamically optimise sports equipment and competition posture in the BMW Group wind tunnel and with computer simulations.\n\n“Together with the many winter sports fans in Germany, we are looking forward to the upcoming season of this fascinating sport with the German biathletes,” said Christian Ach, Head of BMW Germany. “With the new BMW vehicles, they will arrive safely and relaxed from World Cup to World Cup. We wish the biathlon team sheer driving pleasure and a successful season.”\n\nThe German biathlon elite were able to receive their new “company cars” for the World Cup winter at the BMW M Driving Experience Maisach. Subsequently, the DSV team experienced a BMW driver safety training there. What is a matter of course for the athletes on the tracks – rapid cornering, abrupt lane changes, and the fight against the clock – was taught to them on four wheels by two instructors. In fully electric BMW i4s and BMW i5s, evasive manoeuvres without braking, slalom against time, and above all, a lot of driving fun were on the agenda.\n\n“That was really cool. I definitely won't drive my BMW i4 that extremely on the road but it was fun to push the limits in the car today – just as we are used to as competitive athletes,” said Franziska Preuß. “I am very happy that I now have a fully electric vehicle for the first time and am looking forward to seeing how it will prove itself in the World Cup routine.”\n\nThe new season in the BMW IBU World Cup Biathlon begins on November 30, 2024, in Kontiolahti, Finland. The season highlight is the BMW IBU World Championships, which will be held for the first time in Lenzerheide, Switzerland, from February 12 to 23, 2025. BMW has been working successfully with the International Biathlon Union (IBU) since 2010 and has been the title partner of the World Cup and the World Championships since 2014.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i4 eDrive40: Power consumption combined: 18.6 kWh/100 km (62 miles) according to WLTP; CO2 emissions: 0 g/km according to WLTP; CO2 class(es): A BMW i4 M50 xDrive: Power consumption combined: 21.9 kWh/100 km (62 miles) according to WLTP; CO2 emissions: 0 g/km according to WLTP; CO2 class(es): A BMW i5 M60 xDrive: Power consumption combined: 20.5 kWh/100 km (62 miles) according to WLTP; CO2 emissions: 0 g/km according to WLTP; CO2 class(es): A BMW 520d xDrive Touring: Fuel consumption combined: 6.2 - 5.7 l/100 km (62 miles) according to WLTP; CO2 emissions: 163 - 149 g/km according to WLTP; CO2 class(es): F – E"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Mobility partner BMW hands over new vehicles to the DSV Biathlon +++ Driver safety training at the BMW M Driving Academy in Maisach +++ With BMW driving pleasure safely through the World Cup winter +++"}]}

After six successful years together, the partnership between BMW M Motorsport and BMW M works driver Nick Yelloly (GBR) came to an end with the conclusion of the IMSA season last weekend at Road Atlanta (USA). Memorable achievements include victories at the 24-hour races at the Nürburgring (GER) in 2020 and Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) in 2023. Yelloly was also at the helm for the historic first win of the BMW M Hybrid V8 in 2023 at Watkins Glen (USA). The Petit Le Mans was his last race before he takes on new challenges starting in 2025. BMW M Motorsport thanks a great professional and wishes him all the best for the future.\n\nIn 2019, Nick Yelloly joined BMW M Motorsport and immediately celebrated success at the wheel of the BMW M6 GT3. Together with the FIST-Team AAI, he became the driver and team champion in the China GT Championship. Alongside Walkenhorst Motorsport, he won the qualifying race for the 24 Hours of the Nürburgring (GER). A year later, he achieved his first major triumph on the big stage, winning the 24-hour race for ROWE Racing alongside Nick Catsburg (NED) and Alexander Sims (GBR). In 2021, as the defending champion in the “Green Hell”, he secured the prestigious pole position in top qualifying.\n\nIn June/July 2023, Yelloly probably experienced the best week of his racing career so far. First, he achieved the historic first victory of BMW M Motorsport's LMDh prototype, driving the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 alongside Connor De Phillippi (USA) in the IMSA race at Watkins Glen. Directly the following weekend, Yelloly triumphed with Philipp Eng (AUT) and Marco Wittmann (GER) in the ROWE Racing BMW M4 GT3 at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Over the years, he also accumulated numerous other victories and podium finishes. Most recently, Yelloly and De Phillippi finished second at Indianapolis (USA), marking the sixth podium finish for the duo with their BMW M Hybrid V8 in an IMSA race.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Nick Yelloly is a great professional who has achieved a lot with BMW M Motorsport. On behalf of the entire BMW family, I thank him for six wonderful years with plenty of reasons to celebrate. Personally, I will always remember that one week with back-to-back victories at Watkins Glen and Spa-Francorchamps. Nick Yelloly has everything a manufacturer could wish for in a racing driver. He is extremely talented, a great guy on a personal level, and you can always rely on him. Therefore, I am sure that he will be successful in his new job as well. I wish him all the best for his future and look forward to further encounters at racetracks around the world.”\n\nNick Yelloly: “I am incredibly grateful for everything BMW M Motorsport has done for me.

For over 50 years now, the BMW Group has initiated and been engaged in hundreds of cultural cooperations worldwide, supporting hundreds of projects worldwide. In all the activities the company is involved in, the BMW Group guarantees absolute creative freedom. The BMW Group contributes to deepening the knowledge about the arts through long-term partnerships, such as the one concluded with Paris Photo two decades ago. The 2024 edition marks the return of Paris Photo to the historic Grand Palais following extensive renovations. For this occasion, artist Mustapha Azeroual and curator Marjolaine Lévy have created a new immersive scenography for‘The Green Ray’, enriched by new photographic works on large-scale panels and circular mobiles. BMW France supports the VIP programme by providing Paris Photo collectors, artists, curators and VIPs with an electric car service for more sustainable mobility in the capital during the fair.\n\nFor each edition of Paris Photo, BMW presents an artistic project led by the winning duo of the BMW ART MAKERS. This programme offers a grant of 10,000 euros to the artist and 8,000 euros to the curator, a research and production budget of 15,000 euros and solo exhibitions at emblematic events for culture and the visual arts in France, such as Paris Photo.\n\n‘The Green Ray’: an immersive and unique exhibition at Paris Photo Who has not dreamed of seeing what the eye cannot grasp? This is the ambition of ‘The Green Ray’, conceived by artist Mustapha Azeroual and curator Marjolaine Lévy.\n\nThe project is an extension of Mustapha Azeroual's photographic practice, the core of which is the production of abstract images that seek to give form to light and colour. The new panels and circular mobiles, on display at Paris Photo, reflect a protocol consisting first and foremost of recording the colour of the sky at sunrise and sunset on the high seas, in the Arctic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and in the Mediterranean Sea - territories that the artist has never explored before.\n\nMustapha Azeroual works in close collaboration with sailors, who are responsible for shooting sunrises and sunsets according to a procedure defined by him. He selects the most appropriate colours from these images to produce abstractions that are then set up as a lenticular panopticon – an installation of images with a pattern that changes according to the angle of view.\n\nThese abstract images, as rich and varied as they are, subtly denounce human overactivity since the colour of the sky, even in the ocean, is intrinsically linked to our presence on Earth. The poetics of blur and the visual vertigo of the infinite colour variations produced by the lenticular medium plunge the audience into celestial reveries that, behind their pure beauty, hide a very different reality.\n\n‘The Green Ray’ was exhibited for the first time at this year’s Rencontres d'Arles in the summer of 2024. The installation has now been redesigned for Paris Photo with a completely new scenography. The two monumental panopticons are presented in such a way as to create a sinuous path where the lenticular panels, now scattered throughout the space, create an even more destabilised perception for the public. The works on the wall interact with three lenticular mobiles floating in the space, like a nod to their celestial source, which is constantly changing under the effect of the air. The further you go, the more your eye is stimulated by the multiplication of effects produced by these extremely vibrant works.\n\nPractical informationParis Photo at the Grand Palais7 to 10 November 2024THE GREEN RAY exhibition Booth C01\n\nOn the occasion of Paris Photo, BMW France is launching its 4th call for entries for the BMW ART MAKERS programme.

From October 9 to 13, Frieze London and Frieze Masters will return to London’s Regent’s Park. As one of Frieze’s long-term global partners since 2004, BMW will honor the artistic oeuvre of Ndebele artist Esther Mahlangu, who was the first woman to create a BMW Art Car in 1991. Together with BMW, Serpentine will reveal “Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu” (“I am because you are”), a new site-specific mural by Mahlangu in the garden at Serpentine North. In celebration of cultural exchange and responding to Mahlangu’s work, renowned actor, collector and Talk Art host Russell Tovey will curate a selection of artworks from his private collection that will be displayed at Frieze London in the BMW Lounge. He chose pieces by female, queer and artists of colour in response to works by Mahlangu. The first interview publication with Esther Mahlangu, titled “Esther Mahlangu: To Paint is in My Heart”, published by Thames & Hudson, will be launched during Frieze week with co-editors Azu Nwagbogu and Hans Ulrich Obrist.\n\nEsther Mahlangu (b. 1935, South Africa) has been creating large-scale and site-specific works for over eight decades and is a pioneer of Pan-African contemporary art. She began painting at the age of ten, learning the traditional Ndebele techniques and visual language of covering houses in bold patterns from her mother and grandmother. Mahlangu uses natural pigments mixed with clay, soil and cow dung to paint directly on the exteriors of structures in her village. Rather than using stencils and tape to achieve lines and shapes, she paints by hand with chicken feathers and an array of different brushes. The artist also works with acrylic paints on canvas, which allows her to explore different scales and a broader colour palette.\n\nIn 1991, Esther Mahlangu designed the 12th BMW Art Car in the esteemed collection, based on a BMW 525i – becoming the first woman and African artist to do so. Since 1975, artists such as Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, Cao Fei, and John Baldessari have turned BMW race and series cars into works of art. Her BMW Art Car marked the beginning of a longstanding relationship between the BMW Group and Mahlangu, inspiring future collaborations.\n\nBMW and Esther Mahlangu during Frieze London“Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu”, presented in the garden at Serpentine North in collaboration with the BMW Group and The Melrose Gallery, supported by Benjamin Milstein, is Esther Mahlangu’s first public mural in the UK. Painted over sixteen wooden panels, the work depicts traditional Ndebele shapes and patterns outlined with a black border. The title of the work translates directly from Ndebele as “I am because you are\", emphasising the importance of communities and unity among humans and other living species.\n\n“I am proud to present this monumental outdoor work at Serpentine in London. It is my wish that this painting brings much joy to those who see it in celebration and recognition of the interconnectedness that exists between our two nations and indeed all living beings”, comments the artist.\n\nBettina Korek, CEO, and Hans Ulrich Obrist, Artistic Director, Serpentine say: “Esther Mahlangu is is one of the most important artists of our time who continues to inspire emerging talents. Mahlangu is a polymath who brings art into society. This is a wonderful moment to celebrate Serpentine’s friendship with the artist and honour her work in the UK. We’re grateful to all our partners who have made this fantastic project possible and particularly BMW for their support, and we hope audiences will engage with the piece and the unique surroundings of The Royal Parks”.\n\nThe work will be officially inaugurated at the traditional Serpentine breakfast on October 9 during Frieze London.\n\nVarious events at the BMW Lounge at Frieze London will celebrate the relationship with the artist. The lounge exhibition itself salutes Esther Mahlangu’s work, showcasing a selection of the collection of renowned actor, collector and Talk Art podcast host, Russell Tovey, for the first time at Frieze London. As an admirer of the artist’s colourful abstract paintings, he chose pieces by Etel Adnan, Math Bass, Matt Connors, Jadé Fadojutimi, Mary Heilman, Carmen Herrera and Hayley Tompkins in response to Esther Mahlangu’s works “Ndebele Abstract” and “Ndebele Abstract 2022”.\n\n“Esther’s geometric work inspires me deeply, the freedom that can be found within her paintings and her practice resonates throughout my collection. Geometric abstract art has been something that I’ve gravitated towards for many years. To live with these works has felt calming and has satisfied the curiosity and enthusiasm that I long for in an image. I am so excited to bring works from my own personal collection, that bring so much to me on a daily basis, into a rich conversation with Esther Mahlangu”, says Tovey. During a talk followed by a reception on October 10 at the BMW Lounge, Russell Tovey will explain his fascination with Mahlangu.\n\nBMW is proud to enable the first interview publication with Esther Mahlangu. “Esther Mahlangu. To Paint is in My Heart” will be published by Thames & Hudson in autumn 2024 and exclusively pre-launched during Frieze London. The book explores the life and revolutionary art of Esther Mahlangu through a series of interviews between the artist and curators Hans Ulrich Obrist, Azu Nwagbogu and BMW’s head of cultural engagement, Thomas Girst as well as a foreword by Nontobeko Ntombela, curator of the Esther Mahlangu “Then I Knew I Was Good at Painting” retrospective. In addition, the South African fashion designer Thebe Magugu provides an insight into the connection between Esther Mahlangu and Ndebele culture in relation to fashion as part of the book.\n\nOn October 9, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Azu Nwagbogu and Thomas Girst will talk about their collaboration for “Esther Mahlangu. To Paint is in My Heart” at the BMW Lounge and will sign copies the book which will be on sale on site.\n\nThe year marks a pinnacle in Esther Mahlangu’s career. Besides the manifold activities during Frieze London, a retrospective of her work is touring the world: “Then I Knew I Was Good at Painting”, which opened in February 2024 at the Iziko Museums of South Africa. The exhibition showcases Esther Mahlangu's more than 50-year career and her rise as a contemporary artist, a journey that has earned her global recognition. As part of the show, Mahlangu's BMW 525i Art Car returned to South Africa for the first time in over 30 years. The next stop on the global tour is at the Wits Art Museum in Johannesburg, opening on November 19.

On October 10, contemporary Indie-Pop singer Arlo Parks will perform at the legendary KOKO Theatre in Camden. The 24-year-old artist’s most recent LP “My Soft Machine” made it into the Rolling Stone’s 100 Best Albums of 2023. Her debut album “Collapsed in Sunbeams”, released in 2021, won Parks a Mercury Prize and critical acclaim, especially for her poetic and intelligent songwriting portraying the complex reality of her contemporaries.\n\nExploring the intersection of music and the arts to spark inspiring dialogues, Frieze Music provides artists the opportunity to create a unique performance, highlighting their craft through song, inspiration and conversations with fellow artists. Launched during the inaugural Frieze Los Angeles in 2019, the joint initiative between BMW and Frieze has brought together a wide range of musicians, including Moses Sumney, Caroline Polachek, Nilüfer Yanya and Loyle Carner.\n\nTo visit the BMW Lounge, please note that entrance tickets or VIP accreditation for the VIP day on October 9 & 10 are required.

During a talk followed by a reception on October 10 at the BMW Lounge, Russell Tovey will explain his fascination with Mahlangu.\n\nBMW is proud to enable the first interview publication with Esther Mahlangu. “Esther Mahlangu. To Paint is in My Heart” will be published by Thames & Hudson in autumn 2024 and exclusively pre-launched during Frieze London. The book explores the life and revolutionary art of Esther Mahlangu through a series of interviews between the artist and curators Hans Ulrich Obrist, Azu Nwagbogu and BMW’s head of cultural engagement, Thomas Girst as well as a foreword by Nontobeko Ntombela, curator of the Esther Mahlangu “Then I Knew I Was Good at Painting” retrospective. In addition, the South African fashion designer Thebe Magugu provides an insight into the connection between Esther Mahlangu and Ndebele culture in relation to fashion as part of the book.\n\nOn October 9, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Azu Nwagbogu and Thomas Girst will talk about their collaboration for “Esther Mahlangu. To Paint is in My Heart” at the BMW Lounge and will sign copies the book which will be on sale on site.\n\nThe year marks a pinnacle in Esther Mahlangu’s career. Besides the manifold activities during Frieze London, a retrospective of her work is touring the world: “Then I Knew I Was Good at Painting”, which opened in February 2024 at the Iziko Museums of South Africa. The exhibition showcases Esther Mahlangu's more than 50-year career and her rise as a contemporary artist, a journey that has earned her global recognition. As part of the show, Mahlangu's BMW 525i Art Car returned to South Africa for the first time in over 30 years. The next stop on the global tour is at the Wits Art Museum in Johannesburg, opening on November 19. Moreover, her works were part of the 2024 Venice Biennale main exhibition, “Stranieri Ovunque – Foreigners Everywhere”, curated by Adriano Pedrosa. And the latest in her remarkably versatile collaborations with the BMW Group premiered at Frieze L.A. this February: the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, featuring her artistic language and BMW's colour-change technology.\n\nFrieze MusicContinuing their long-term collaboration, BMW and Frieze will once again partner to present Frieze Music in London. On October 10, contemporary Indie-Pop singer Arlo Parks will perform at the legendary KOKO Theatre in Camden. The 24-year-old artist’s most recent LP “My Soft Machine” made it into the Rolling Stone’s 100 Best Albums of 2023. Her debut album “Collapsed in Sunbeams”, released in 2021, won Parks a Mercury Prize and critical acclaim, especially for her poetic and intelligent songwriting portraying the complex reality of her contemporaries.\n\nExploring the intersection of music and the arts to spark inspiring dialogues, Frieze Music provides artists the opportunity to create a unique performance, highlighting their craft through song, inspiration and conversations with fellow artists. Launched during the inaugural Frieze Los Angeles in 2019, the joint initiative between BMW and Frieze has brought together a wide range of musicians, including Moses Sumney, Caroline Polachek, Nilüfer Yanya and Loyle Carner.\n\nTo visit the BMW Lounge, please note that entrance tickets or VIP accreditation for the VIP day on October 9 & 10 are required.

Two more victories on the road to the riders’ world championship title and important points for the manufacturers’ battle – Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team once again shone at Estoril. The penultimate round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took place at the Portuguese circuit near Lisbon. Riding his #1 BMW M 1000 RR, Razgatlioglu won both the first main race and the Superpole race, and added a second-place podium finish in race two. He also set new lap records over the weekend. As the leader of the riders’ standings, “El Turco” now heads to the season finale at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) with a 39-point lead over his closest rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati).\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) also showed strong form at Estoril. In Saturday’s first race, he was caught up in a multi-rider incident at the first corner through no fault of his own. He was able to take part in the restart but faced technical issues and finished 15th. In the Superpole race, he secured an important ninth place to improve his grid position for race two, where he finished tenth – once again inside the top ten.\n\nIn the manufacturers’ standings, BMW remains hot on the heels of leaders Ducati, trailing by just three points ahead of the final round. A total of 62 points will still be up for grabs in the last three races of the season at Jerez de la Frontera.\n\nReactions after the Estoril round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another important step towards the title and an almost perfect weekend for us. With two victories and a second place, we can now travel to Jerez with a very solid points advantage. Toprak’s performance was once again outstanding. At the same time, Nicolò Bulega’s performance also deserves recognition. What those two showed in the races, pulling away from the rest of the field, was on another level. We are also very happy with Mickey’s performance; he did a great job with his top-ten results. I think he too is ready for his, for now, last race weekend in WorldSBK. We will now do everything we can – in Berlin, Munich, England, and at the track – to be as well prepared as possible, and we’re looking forward to the season finale.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another fantastic weekend with two wins, pole position, lap records, and a second place. With this tremendous weekend, Toprak extended his lead in the riders’ championship – a maximum success that the entire team can be proud of. Toprak showed his professionalism in every race, and in the second main race he knew that second place was also crucial for the championship, for the big goal. He didn’t take any unnecessary risks to go for the win. Looking ahead to Jerez, we are excited for an intense finale, and we want to express our gratitude to the organisers and the FIM, whose control and regulatory mechanisms ensure fair competition that thrills fans at the track and on TV with two magnificent riders at the front.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I was really happy to win the first race. At the beginning, all was under control but then Nicolò had a bit more grip than me. At the end of the race I was spinning a lot but he was too. In the Superpole race, the start was a bit difficult, I was fighting with Nicolò on the first two laps. But then I just focused on my pace, pushing for a good lap time and trying to not make any mistake. So in the end I won again. Race two was more difficult for me. I was back in fifth, had to overtake but just focused on my job to catch Nicolò. When I was back in second place I was pushing so hard on every lap that the rear tyre dropped, so I was struggling a lot. I had to start to manage my race and I just thought: ‘Okay, this time it is impossible to win, P2 is enough because I need the good points for the championship.’ Now I am looking forward to Jerez. We have some margin in the championship, and everything else we will see there. Nicolò is very strong at Jerez but I will try to do my best again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At the last couple of rounds we had a great feeling with the bike and then we came here and for some reason we struggled quite a lot with the bike in the beginning. We couldn’t get the right feeling and not the right speed on Friday. For Saturday morning, we improved our pace and our package a lot. I was confident for Superpole but unfortunately I lost a lot of time by missing a gear. Especially here you lose a lot of places on the grid and P12 was not fantastic. In race one, I had a good start, but unfortunately someone crashed in turn one and took me out. The guys in the pit box made sure that the spare bike was ready and I was able to do the re-start. After a few good laps I unfortunately had a technical issue. I managed to finish the race and score one point, but it was a very disappointing Saturday. In Sunday’s Superpole race we decided to go with the race tyre as we felt that the qualifying tyre was a big risk. I finished P9 which was not too bad. It was good to move up on the grid, especially for turn one. My start in race two was not great but I had a good pace. I was catching up with the guys in front of me, but I just seemed to struggle a bit with the bike when I got really close to them. I was fighting hard and finished tenth collecting more points. Now I’m looking forward to Jerez, especially in regards of the championship. It looks like Toprak will win it there, so that’s the thing everyone is looking out for.”\n\nAir temperature: 24°, track temperature: 28°, humidity: 54%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 24°, track temperature: 37°, humidity: 40%, conditions: dry, laps: 18.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 4, 1:35.696 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 29°, humidity: 57%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 5, 1:34.973 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 25°, track temperature: 38°, humidity: 51%, conditions: dry, laps: 21.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 8, 1:34.973\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R11/12, after 33 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R11/12, after 33 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Toprak Razgatlioglu claims two wins and a second place at the penultimate WorldSBK round at Estoril. +++ The ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team rider leads the championship standings with a 39-point advantage heading into the final weekend at Jerez, while BMW is close to Ducati in the manufacturers’ standings. +++ Michael van der Mark endures bad luck on Saturday but bounces back with two strong races on Sunday. +++"}]}

Two more victories on the road to the riders’ world championship title and important points for the manufacturers’ battle – Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team once again shone at Estoril. The penultimate round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took place at the Portuguese circuit near Lisbon. Riding his #1 BMW M 1000 RR, Razgatlioglu won both the first main race and the Superpole race, and added a second-place podium finish in race two. He also set new lap records over the weekend. As the leader of the riders’ standings, “El Turco” now heads to the season finale at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) with a 39-point lead over his closest rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati).\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) also showed strong form at Estoril. In Saturday’s first race, he was caught up in a multi-rider incident at the first corner through no fault of his own. He was able to take part in the restart but faced technical issues and finished 15th. In the Superpole race, he secured an important ninth place to improve his grid position for race two, where he finished tenth – once again inside the top ten.\n\nIn the manufacturers’ standings, BMW remains hot on the heels of leaders Ducati, trailing by just three points ahead of the final round. A total of 62 points will still be up for grabs in the last three races of the season at Jerez de la Frontera.\n\nReactions after the Estoril round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another important step towards the title and an almost perfect weekend for us. With two victories and a second place, we can now travel to Jerez with a very solid points advantage. Toprak’s performance was once again outstanding. At the same time, Nicolò Bulega’s performance also deserves recognition. What those two showed in the races, pulling away from the rest of the field, was on another level. We are also very happy with Mickey’s performance; he did a great job with his top-ten results. I think he too is ready for his, for now, last race weekend in WorldSBK. We will now do everything we can – in Berlin, Munich, England, and at the track – to be as well prepared as possible, and we’re looking forward to the season finale.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another fantastic weekend with two wins, pole position, lap records, and a second place. With this tremendous weekend, Toprak extended his lead in the riders’ championship – a maximum success that the entire team can be proud of. Toprak showed his professionalism in every race, and in the second main race he knew that second place was also crucial for the championship, for the big goal. He didn’t take any unnecessary risks to go for the win. Looking ahead to Jerez, we are excited for an intense finale, and we want to express our gratitude to the organisers and the FIM, whose control and regulatory mechanisms ensure fair competition that thrills fans at the track and on TV with two magnificent riders at the front.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I was really happy to win the first race. At the beginning, all was under control but then Nicolò had a bit more grip than me. At the end of the race I was spinning a lot but he was too. In the Superpole race, the start was a bit difficult, I was fighting with Nicolò on the first two laps. But then I just focused on my pace, pushing for a good lap time and trying to not make any mistake. So in the end I won again. Race two was more difficult for me. I was back in fifth, had to overtake but just focused on my job to catch Nicolò. When I was back in second place I was pushing so hard on every lap that the rear tyre dropped, so I was struggling a lot. I had to start to manage my race and I just thought: ‘Okay, this time it is impossible to win, P2 is enough because I need the good points for the championship.’ Now I am looking forward to Jerez. We have some margin in the championship, and everything else we will see there. Nicolò is very strong at Jerez but I will try to do my best again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At the last couple of rounds we had a great feeling with the bike and then we came here and for some reason we struggled quite a lot with the bike in the beginning. We couldn’t get the right feeling and not the right speed on Friday. For Saturday morning, we improved our pace and our package a lot. I was confident for Superpole but unfortunately I lost a lot of time by missing a gear. Especially here you lose a lot of places on the grid and P12 was not fantastic. In race one, I had a good start, but unfortunately someone crashed in turn one and took me out. The guys in the pit box made sure that the spare bike was ready and I was able to do the re-start. After a few good laps I unfortunately had a technical issue. I managed to finish the race and score one point, but it was a very disappointing Saturday. In Sunday’s Superpole race we decided to go with the race tyre as we felt that the qualifying tyre was a big risk. I finished P9 which was not too bad. It was good to move up on the grid, especially for turn one. My start in race two was not great but I had a good pace. I was catching up with the guys in front of me, but I just seemed to struggle a bit with the bike when I got really close to them. I was fighting hard and finished tenth collecting more points. Now I’m looking forward to Jerez, especially in regards of the championship. It looks like Toprak will win it there, so that’s the thing everyone is looking out for.”\n\nAir temperature: 24°, track temperature: 28°, humidity: 54%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 24°, track temperature: 37°, humidity: 40%, conditions: dry, laps: 18.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 4, 1:35.696 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 29°, humidity: 57%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 5, 1:34.973 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 25°, track temperature: 38°, humidity: 51%, conditions: dry, laps: 21.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 8, 1:34.973\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R11/12, after 33 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R11/12, after 33 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

On the occasion of Art Basel Miami Beach 2023, BMW and Alex Israel will unveil REMEMBR, an AI-powered, participatory and interactive video installation that guides visitors on a journey through time and memory in a captivating fusion of art and technology. The new 100% electric BMW i5 played a fundamental role in inspiring Israel for this collaboration. REMEMBR will be exhibited from December 8 to 10, 2023, at Art Basel Miami Beach, the world's premier art show for Modern and contemporary art. As a global partner of the Art Basel shows, BMW will once again provide the VIP car service.\n\nAlex Israel is a renowned contemporary artist based in Los Angeles, known for his innovative and thought-provoking work that often explores the intersection of popular culture, art and technology. His body of work, which includes paintings, sculpture and mixed-media installations, frequently draws inspiration from the vibrant culture and iconic imagery of his hometown. Israel's unique artistic perspective allows him to capture the zeitgeist of modern life in a way that is both insightful and engaging. His collaboration with BMW on the REMEMBR video installation, using the BMW i5 as a pivotal inspiration, showcases his commitment to exploring the boundaries of what art can be in the digital age.\n\n\"It was a true pleasure to meet with Alex in Munich and explore the BMW i5 together. His fascination with our latest innovation mirrors our shared commitment to blending the worlds of technology, design and art to pursue something truly extraordinary. The BMW i5 is a vehicle that not only moves you physically but emotionally and imaginatively, much like Alex's art,\" said Domagoj Dukec, Head of BMW Design.\n\nIsrael worked closely with BMW to develop AI technology that will collect, filter, compose and choreograph the visitor’s phone’s camera content. In an immersive installation across seven custom-designed screens at Art Basel Miami Beach, guests are invited to discover the hyper-memories of Alex Israel and, equally, share their own.\n\n\"Working on REMEMBR with BMW has been an incredible learning experience. The electric BMW i5 played a significant role in the conception of this project,\" said Alex Israel. \"I always say that my real studio is my car. I get most of my ideas while I’m driving around LA and my memories stream and fuse with my imagination to bear new ideas as the radio shuffles and the city passes me by. The i5, with its AI technology and the My Modes feature, resonated for me as a milestone in the evolution of human-machine relationships. The i5 is a memory-making tool that encourages discovery, anticipates human need and tailors experience to each individual driver. Similarly, our phones have also helped to close this gap, evolving from mere communication devices into digital diaries—extensions of our memories and external hard drives in our pockets. REMEMBR asks: what if we could revisit and share all these memories in an engaging way? This project is a testament to the power of technology in shaping our memories and experiences, and I'm excited for visitors to explore it and themselves this December at Art Basel in Miami Beach\", continued Israel.\n\n“For over 50 years now, BMW has initiated cultural collaborations and forged meaningful connections with world-renowned artists and by extension art lovers everywhere - while promoting the creative spirit that drives our brand forward and inspires us all,” said Marcus Casey, Chief Marketing Officer, BMW of North America. “We’re delighted to collaborate with Alex Israel on this project that seamlessly blends art, technology and design, much like the first-ever 100% electric BMW i5.”\n\nREMEMBR reflects BMW’s commitment to innovation, cutting-edge technology and design, which are key features of the new BMW i5. The new BMW 5 Series is digital, dynamic and now, with the BMW i5, also fully electric. The i5 represents the joy of moving forward as a symbol of integration and an empowering mindset. It represents the emotional spearhead that combines tech magic and human-centric design in a fully electric vehicle. The BMW My Modes allow the car to respond to the driver’s mindset with different sensory environments, creating a human-centered approach to the use of technology.\n\nExperience REMEMBR and the fully electric BMW i5: December 8 - 10, 2023BMW Lounge at Art Basel Miami Beach Collectors LoungeMiami Beach Convention Center, 1901 Convention Center Drive, FL 33139\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i5 M60 xDrive: Power consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 20.6 – 18.2 kWh/100 km.

After the 2024 season, an era comes to an end at BMW M Motorsport with Bruno Spengler (CAN) leaving after 13 years as a BMW M works driver, at his own request, to face new professional challenges. By winning the DTM title in the comeback year in 2012, he secured his place in BMW M Motorsport history books. With Spengler's departure, a true fan favourite and a great ambassador for the BMW brand is leaving .\n\nAt the end of 2011, Bruno Spengler joined BMW M Motorsport to play a key role in the brand's return to the DTM for the 2012 season. He celebrated his first victory in just the second race at the Lausitzring (GER) in his matte black BMW M3 DTM. Spengler won a total of four races in 2012 and was crowned champion in a thrilling season finale at Hockenheim (GER). At the same time, BMW M Team Schnitzer and BMW M Motorsport celebrated winning the team and manufacturer championships. The “Black Beast” became his trademark in the following years. Between 2012 and 2019, Spengler competed in 122 DTM races for BMW M Motorsport, achieving seven victories and 24 podium finishes.\n\nSpengler was also successful in GT racing. He achieved podium finishes at both the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) and the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA). In 2015, he formed a trio with Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) and Timo Glock (GER) at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), driving the now legendary BMW Z4 GT3 in Michel Vaillant design. In 2023, alongside Jens Klingmann (GER), Spengler won the title in the Italian GT Sprint Championship driving the BMW M4 GT3. Outside the cockpit, Spengler served, inter alia, as an ambassador for BMW M Motorsport Automotive Gaming.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “In Bruno Spengler, a legend in the history of BMW M Motorsport is leaving us. I remember well competing against him in the DTM when I was with my previous employer, Audi. Since I've been at BMW M Motorsport, I've come to know him as an extremely pleasant and valuable member of the BMW M Motorsport family, far beyond just racing. His sporting achievements speak for themselves, but his positive nature has also made him a big fan favourite to this day. I wish Bruno all the best for his professional and private future and hope to still see him at the racetrack from time to time.”\n\nBruno Spengler: “I would like to sincerely thank the entire BMW M Motorsport family, all the engineers, and all the mechanics for the past 13 years. I had the privilege of driving incredibly fantastic racing cars all over the world – it was a great time. My special thanks go to the former BMW Board Member, Dr. Klaus Draeger, who particularly supported me in my early years at BMW M Motorsport, as well as to Charly Lamm and the entire Schnitzer family, with whom I won the DTM title in 2012 and experienced many fantastic years together. It was not an easy decision for me to leave the BMW M Motorsport family, but I am at a point in my career where a new challenge with a long-term perspective was important to me.

The third round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship 2024 (WorldSBK) brings BMW Motorrad Motorsport to the ‘Cathedral of Speed’. From 19th to 21st April, WorldSBK visits the famous Assen TT Circuit, Netherlands. Following a successful season start with wins and podium finishes for BMW Motorrad factory rider Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, the goal is to bring the BMW M 1000 RR onto the podium at Assen as well.\n\nAssen is the home race for Razgatlioglu’s teammate, BMW Motorrad factory rider Michael van der Mark (NED), who recently showed his return to the top field with top-four results at Barcelona (ESP). The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team can also consider the round in the Netherlands a home race, as its team base in northern German Cuxhaven is only two and a half hours away from Assen. The team aims to continue where it left off in race two at Barcelona and to fight for the top ten with both BMW Motorrad factory riders Garrett Gerloff (USA) and Scott Redding (GBR).\n\nQuotes ahead of the Assen round.\n\nMarc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Assen is always something special. The circuit has a long history, and the enthusiasm of the fans there is always great. The first two race weekends of the season have gone excellently, and accordingly, we come to Assen with a lot of optimism. We have shown on tracks that don’t necessarily suit us well how competitive the BMW M 1000 RR is, not only with Toprak’s wins and podiums, but with good results for our entire WorldSBK squad. However, we do not rest on our laurels, but we all work hard to continue this path at Assen. The past races have once again confirmed how tight it is in WorldSBK, but our goal is to be contenders in the top field at Assen as well.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff (#31 BMW M 1000 RR, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team): “I’m looking forward to Assen. It’s a track that I really enjoy and a track that I feel that I flow very well with. I think also that with some of the changes we have made with the bike it will be a good track for the BMW M 1000 RR and something that I can flow on. I’m looking forward to getting to the track and to seeing my team again after a couple of weeks off and putting our heads down and try to do the best we can.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (#54 BMW M 1000 RR, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team): “I am very happy to come back to Assen again. We don’t know yet how the weather will be, but it is always a bit difficult there. It looks like it will be cold and with maybe some rain; we will see. It’s Mickey’s home race and maybe he can help me a little bit because it’s my first time there with BMW and Mickey is always strong there so maybe he can help me with some lines and some data.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nLeipzig. On 1 March 2005 BMW Group Plant Leipzig went on stream – with series production of the fifth-generation BMW 3 Series Sedan. Its construction had been announced four years earlier, in July 2001, with the location chosen from among more than 250 applicants. Since then, some 3.75 million cars have rolled off the production lines, and the plant has been steadily extended and upgraded. The BMW Group has so far invested more than 5 billion euros in the site – and will continue to capitalise on its flexibility in the future.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig currently manufactures four models with three different types of drive by two different brands – all on the same production line: the BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer (including the plug-in hybrid version) and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé as well as the MINI Countryman in both its fully electric and conventionally powered variants. When the plant was in planning, output was expected to total 650 units a day. Now, 20 years down the line, capacity stands at up to 1,300 units a day. Since 2005 there have been 20 different product launches of BMWs and MINIs Made in Leipzig.\n\nExtraordinary architecture and flexible structures\n\nIn its 20 years of existence, BMW Group Plant Leipzig has set standards time and again and clocked up a succession of milestones. The architecture of the central building alone remains impressive to this day. Designed by the renowned Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, it was awarded the German Architecture Prize in 2005, the year it opened. As the centrepiece and linking element of the plant, it provides the backdrop to the spectacular procession of vehicles that pass overhead through the offices on their way through the production process.\n\nThe flexible structures of the plant halls have also proven their worth to this day, throughout the various expansion stages of the facility. Leipzig was the first assembly plant in the world to feature a ‘finger’ arrangement in the production hall, for example, which offers ideal logistics solutions and can be flexibly adapted as needed. Developed specifically for this site, the finger layout allows trucks to deliver parts and preassembliesstraight to the production line. It also means extensions can be added as needed and new assembly stations integrated easily without having to rebuild the line from scratch. At the moment various further extensions are being added on the 240-hectare site.\n\nFor the last 20 years, BMW Group Plant Leipzig has demonstrated tremendous flexibility and adaptability, accommodating new products, processes and technologies. It has often played a pioneering role within the BMW Group production network. Its first upgrade consisted of the addition of a new press shop. This went into operation in 2009 and incorporated the first high-speed servo press in the world, able to produce pressed parts with unprecedented speed and efficiency. By 2014 three additional large-scale presses and two coil systems for body panels had also been installed, completing the press shop upgrade.\n\nPioneer in electromobility\n\nOne particularly defining moment for Plant Leipzig was the decision to produce its first fully electric vehicle there, making it the birthplace of electromobility at the BMW Group. Between 2013 and 2022 more than 250,000 all-electric BMW i3 vehicles rolled off the production lines. Their carbon bodies were a world first in series production. In 2014 the BMW i8 followed: the first plug-in hybrid by the BMW Group, it featured an award-winning, futuristic design and progressive technologies, which together made it an icon among sportscars. With 20,500 units made – including the BMW i8 roadster launched in 2018 – the era drew to a close in 2020.\n\nBut the team’s expertise in electromobility continues: in 2021 BMW Group Plant Leipzig launched e-component manufacturing for high-voltage battery production. Having started with the production of battery modules for the BMW Group production network, facilities were expanded within four years to include further stages of manufacturing and additional production lines. Since the start of MINI Countryman Electric production in March 2024, Plant Leipzig has carried out the entire process of high-voltage battery manufacturing for the fifth generation of batteries, with its five cell-coating lines, three module assembly lines and two lines for high-voltage battery assembly. The batteries are used in the MINI Countryman Electric and fully electric BMW models at various BMW Group sites.\n\nFrom rear-wheel to front-wheel drive\n\nIt’s not just the BMW i8 that made 2014 a landmark year: it was also the year production of the first generation of BMW 2 Series Active Tourer began. This brought fundamental change to BMW Group Plant Leipzig: it was the first ever BMW with a front-wheel drive architecture and paved the way for this drive technology to become integrated into Plant Leipzig’s production lines. Thanks to Leipzig’s flexibility, the sports activity tourer was able to roll off the same line as the BMW 1 Series, 2 Series and first-generation BMW X1, all of which are rear-wheel drives.\n\nIntegrating the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer required just a few minor adjustments to the paintshop and assembly, but in the bodyshop, its new front-wheel drive concept and vehicle architecture meant a whole new production area was needed. About a year and a half later, production of a plug-in hybrid model was launched: the BMW 225xe. Like the BMW i8, this featured a combined combustion-engine and electric drive. Its successor, the second-generation BMW Active Tourer, in production since 2021, is also manufactured with either a plug-in hybrid drive or an internal combustion engine. In 2021, Leipzig’s rear-wheel drive era came to an end when the BMW 2 Series Coupé, BMW 2 Series Convertible and BMW M2 were phased out.\n\nProduction of the MINI Countryman is another USP of Plant Leipzig within the production network: it is the only full vehicle production facility in the BMW Group to produce BMW- and MINI-badged cars on one and the same production line.\n\nImportant employer in the region\n\nWith some 6,800 BMW employees and more than 11,000 people based locally, the BMW Group plant is a major contributor to the economy and a key employer in the region. When it first went on stream, it had roughly 2,600 BMW employees, with plans for around 5,500 jobs over the medium term.\n\nIn 2001, when Leipzig was chosen as the site for a new plant, the enthusiasm and welcome across the region were huge. Job applications poured in. On the day of the announcement alone, the specially established call centre took more than 4,000 calls. Over the next few days, the post bags were full, and by September 2001 thirty-five apprentices had become the first cohort to receive an employment contract with BMW Group Plant Leipzig. Since then, Leipzig has trained some 1,100 apprentices.\n\nLast year Plant Leipzig opened its Talent Campus. This accommodates training and development spaces in a single new building on the plant premises, offering the perfect conditions for employee training.\n\nIn 2024 the MINI Countryman meant production volumes increased, marking another first for Leipzig: the introduction of nightshifts – unprecedented in the history of the plant.Today, BMW and MINI vehicles are manufactured round the clock, in three shifts. The additional shift has created jobs for another 900 employees.\n\nProgressive energy management\n\nPlanning the BMW plant in Leipzig, efficient and sustainable processes played a crucial role – not just in vehicle production but in energy supplies as well. Visible from afar, the plant’s four wind turbines are among its landmark features and have been powering production with green energy since 2013. With a total capacity of 10 megawatts, they generate 26 gigawatt hours a year of electricity from wind energy – enough to cover about 15 percent of the plant’s total energy needs.\n\nIn addition, BMW Group Plant Leipzig is equipped for interim energy storage, with a battery storage farm that went into operation in 2017. This comprises up to 700 second-life high-voltage batteries from BMW i3 cars, enabling us to optimise local energy management and help stabilise the electricity network.\n\nLooking to the future, BMW Group Plant Leipzig attaches great importance to hydrogen as a fuel. In pursuit of its vision of largely decarbonising production – by replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen – it will need sufficient supplies from a grid. A regional hydrogen network is currently under construction, and Plant Leipzig plans to tap into it.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig has extensive experience of working with hydrogen, having already used it for in-house plant logistics for more than a decade. A pioneer in the automotive industry, it opened Germany’s first indoor hydrogen filling station in 2013.

On 1 March 2005 BMW Group Plant Leipzig went on stream – with series production of the fifth-generation BMW 3 Series Sedan. Its construction had been announced four years earlier, in July 2001, with the location chosen from among more than 250 applicants. Since then, some 3.75 million cars have rolled off the production lines, and the plant has been steadily extended and upgraded. The BMW Group has so far invested more than 5 billion euros in the site – and will continue to capitalise on its flexibility in the future.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig currently manufactures four models with three different types of drive by two different brands – all on the same production line: the BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer (including the plug-in hybrid version) and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé as well as the MINI Countryman in both its fully electric and conventionally powered variants. When the plant was in planning, output was expected to total 650 units a day. Now, 20 years down the line, capacity stands at up to 1,300 units a day. Since 2005 there have been 20 different product launches of BMWs and MINIs Made in Leipzig.\n\nExtraordinary architecture and flexible structures\n\nIn its 20 years of existence, BMW Group Plant Leipzig has set standards time and again and clocked up a succession of milestones. The architecture of the central building alone remains impressive to this day. Designed by the renowned Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, it was awarded the German Architecture Prize in 2005, the year it opened. As the centrepiece and linking element of the plant, it provides the backdrop to the spectacular procession of vehicles that pass overhead through the offices on their way through the production process.\n\nThe flexible structures of the plant halls have also proven their worth to this day, throughout the various expansion stages of the facility. Leipzig was the first assembly plant in the world to feature a ‘finger’ arrangement in the production hall, for example, which offers ideal logistics solutions and can be flexibly adapted as needed. Developed specifically for this site, the finger layout allows trucks to deliver parts and preassembliesstraight to the production line. It also means extensions can be added as needed and new assembly stations integrated easily without having to rebuild the line from scratch. At the moment various further extensions are being added on the 240-hectare site.\n\nFor the last 20 years, BMW Group Plant Leipzig has demonstrated tremendous flexibility and adaptability, accommodating new products, processes and technologies. It has often played a pioneering role within the BMW Group production network. Its first upgrade consisted of the addition of a new press shop. This went into operation in 2009 and incorporated the first high-speed servo press in the world, able to produce pressed parts with unprecedented speed and efficiency. By 2014 three additional large-scale presses and two coil systems for body panels had also been installed, completing the press shop upgrade.\n\nPioneer in electromobility\n\nOne particularly defining moment for Plant Leipzig was the decision to produce its first fully electric vehicle there, making it the birthplace of electromobility at the BMW Group. Between 2013 and 2022 more than 250,000 all-electric BMW i3 vehicles rolled off the production lines. Their carbon bodies were a world first in series production. In 2014 the BMW i8 followed: the first plug-in hybrid by the BMW Group, it featured an award-winning, futuristic design and progressive technologies, which together made it an icon among sportscars. With 20,500 units made – including the BMW i8 roadster launched in 2018 – the era drew to a close in 2020.\n\nBut the team’s expertise in electromobility continues: in 2021 BMW Group Plant Leipzig launched e-component manufacturing for high-voltage battery production. Having started with the production of battery modules for the BMW Group production network, facilities were expanded within four years to include further stages of manufacturing and additional production lines. Since the start of MINI Countryman Electric production in March 2024, Plant Leipzig has carried out the entire process of high-voltage battery manufacturing for the fifth generation of batteries, with its five cell-coating lines, three module assembly lines and two lines for high-voltage battery assembly. The batteries are used in the MINI Countryman Electric and fully electric BMW models at various BMW Group sites.\n\nFrom rear-wheel to front-wheel drive\n\nIt’s not just the BMW i8 that made 2014 a landmark year: it was also the year production of the first generation of BMW 2 Series Active Tourer began. This brought fundamental change to BMW Group Plant Leipzig: it was the first ever BMW with a front-wheel drive architecture and paved the way for this drive technology to become integrated into Plant Leipzig’s production lines. Thanks to Leipzig’s flexibility, the sports activity tourer was able to roll off the same line as the BMW 1 Series, 2 Series and first-generation BMW X1, all of which are rear-wheel drives.\n\nIntegrating the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer required just a few minor adjustments to the paintshop and assembly, but in the bodyshop, its new front-wheel drive concept and vehicle architecture meant a whole new production area was needed. About a year and a half later, production of a plug-in hybrid model was launched: the BMW 225xe. Like the BMW i8, this featured a combined combustion-engine and electric drive. Its successor, the second-generation BMW Active Tourer, in production since 2021, is also manufactured with either a plug-in hybrid drive or an internal combustion engine. In 2021, Leipzig’s rear-wheel drive era came to an end when the BMW 2 Series Coupé, BMW 2 Series Convertible and BMW M2 were phased out.\n\nProduction of the MINI Countryman is another USP of Plant Leipzig within the production network: it is the only full vehicle production facility in the BMW Group to produce BMW- and MINI-badged cars on one and the same production line.\n\nImportant employer in the region\n\nWith some 6,800 BMW employees and more than 11,000 people based locally, the BMW Group plant is a major contributor to the economy and a key employer in the region. When it first went on stream, it had roughly 2,600 BMW employees, with plans for around 5,500 jobs over the medium term.\n\nIn 2001, when Leipzig was chosen as the site for a new plant, the enthusiasm and welcome across the region were huge. Job applications poured in. On the day of the announcement alone, the specially established call centre took more than 4,000 calls. Over the next few days, the post bags were full, and by September 2001 thirty-five apprentices had become the first cohort to receive an employment contract with BMW Group Plant Leipzig. Since then, Leipzig has trained some 1,100 apprentices.\n\nLast year Plant Leipzig opened its Talent Campus. This accommodates training and development spaces in a single new building on the plant premises, offering the perfect conditions for employee training.\n\nIn 2024 the MINI Countryman meant production volumes increased, marking another first for Leipzig: the introduction of nightshifts – unprecedented in the history of the plant.Today, BMW and MINI vehicles are manufactured round the clock, in three shifts. The additional shift has created jobs for another 900 employees.\n\nProgressive energy management\n\nPlanning the BMW plant in Leipzig, efficient and sustainable processes played a crucial role – not just in vehicle production but in energy supplies as well. Visible from afar, the plant’s four wind turbines are among its landmark features and have been powering production with green energy since 2013. With a total capacity of 10 megawatts, they generate 26 gigawatt hours a year of electricity from wind energy – enough to cover about 15 percent of the plant’s total energy needs.\n\nIn addition, BMW Group Plant Leipzig is equipped for interim energy storage, with a battery storage farm that went into operation in 2017. This comprises up to 700 second-life high-voltage batteries from BMW i3 cars, enabling us to optimise local energy management and help stabilise the electricity network.\n\nLooking to the future, BMW Group Plant Leipzig attaches great importance to hydrogen as a fuel. In pursuit of its vision of largely decarbonising production – by replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen – it will need sufficient supplies from a grid. A regional hydrogen network is currently under construction, and Plant Leipzig plans to tap into it.\n\nBMW Group Plant Leipzig has extensive experience of working with hydrogen, having already used it for in-house plant logistics for more than a decade. A pioneer in the automotive industry, it opened Germany’s first indoor hydrogen filling station in 2013. It now operates five such facilities for refuelling forklifts and tug trains in intralogistics. Its hydrogen fuel cell-powered fleet currently consists of over 200 vehicles and is one of the largest in Europe.\n\nPlant Leipzig was also the first car plant in the world to introduce a brand-new bivalent burner technology that can run on either natural gas or hydrogen.

After an eight-week break, BMW Motorrad Motorsport is now gearing up for the fourth round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK).

Those two days were also successful and promising for the upcoming races at the same location.\n\nQuotes ahead of the Misano round.\n\nMarc Bongers, Sporting Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “After the very long break, we can hardly wait to continue the WorldSBK season at Misano.

It was nice to have the test at Cremona to be back on the bike and to regain some feeling after not riding for so long.

I have the feeling that we are very strong because the last test was really good. My target for the weekend is to get three wins but the races are always a different story. We will see. I will try to give my best and I am feeling really positive. I just still have a little bit of pain in my shoulder because before went to the test, I had a crash. I did not more than ten laps but in general I feel that everything is good. On Friday, we will immediately start with a race simulation to understand where we stand. Overall, I’m very optimistic and especially mentally I am really ready to race.

The BMW M 1000 RR has passed the endurance test, and BMW Motorrad Motorsport was more successful at the Suzuka 8 Hours (JPN) within the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) than ever before. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team fought its way to an outstanding fifth place with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR in a field full of strong Japanese teams. With this, BMW Motorrad factory riders Markus Reiterberger (GER), Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) secured the team’s best result to date at this endurance classic. In the championship standings, the team improved to third place. In the Superstock class, the privateer BMW teams TONE RT SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW and Team Étoile achieved a 1-2 result for the BMW M 1000 RR.\n\nAs expected, the external conditions in Suzuka pushed riders, teams, and material to their limits. Air temperatures of over 35 degrees Celsius, extremely high humidity, and asphalt temperatures of 60 degrees Celsius made the eight-hour race a major challenge, which the BMW teams mastered with flying colours.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team already showcased its potential with a strong qualifying performance on Friday, securing one of the coveted spots in the Top 10 Trial on Saturday. There the team claimed an excellent fourth starting position for the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. In the race, starting rider Reiterberger briefly took the lead at the start. Throughout the race Reiterberger, Guintoli, and Mikhalchik maintained a long-standing position in sixth place, thanks to flawless performances from both the riders and the team, eventually taking over fifth place, which they held until the end of the eight-hour race.\n\nIn the Superstock class, the privateer BMW teams celebrated unprecedented success. Victory went to the #95 BMW M 1000 RR of TONE RT SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW, with BMW Motorrad rider Hannes Soomer (EST) alternating with Japanese riders Tomoya Hoshino and Ainosuke Yoshida. Team Étoile completed the double success with the #25 BMW M 1000 RR, ridden by Yudai Kamei (JPN), Hikari Okubo (JPN), and Roberto Rolfo (ITA).\n\nThree other BMW teams also competed in Suzuka: Team TARO PLUSONE with SDG finished 13th in the EWC class with the #6 BMW M 1000 RR, with Taro Sekiguchi (JPN), Kyosuke Okuda (JPN), and reigning Canadian Superbike champion, Ben Young (CAN), sharing riding duties. Team SHINSYUREN with TOTEC (#42) was placed 21st in the EWC class with Isami Higashimura, Shuichiro Nakamura, and Tatsuya Nakamura (all JPN). Team Frontier (#96), with Azlan Shah Kamaruzaman (MAS), Kevin Manfredi (ITA), and Chris Leesch (LUX), retired early.\n\nThe Suzuka 8 Hours marked the third of four events in the 2024 FIM EWC. The season finale, the 24-hour race Bol d’Or in Le Castellet (FRA), will be held on 14th/15th September.\n\nReactions after the Suzuka 8 Hours.\n\nMarc Bongers, Sporting Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was a very pleasing result in Suzuka, which we followed from the WorldSBK event in Most. Suzuka is always an exceptional race, and securing fifth place in the ‘lion’s den’ is fantastic. This is an extremely good result with our package. In Suzuka it’s simply a fact that it becomes difficult if you’re not using the Bridgestone tyres developed there. However, our tyre partner Dunlop supported us greatly, and we received special tyres for Suzuka from Dunlop Japan. This helped us a lot. In qualifying we broke into the 2:05 times for the first time, which is an incredible achievement by the team, riders, and all partners. The team achieved a great result, which keeps our chances alive to fight for the world championship at the finale, the Bol d’Or. Additionally, there was the double victory in the Superstock class. It was truly excellent.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I am very proud of the team and of the result. We had 37 degrees, it felt like 52 degrees, and that’s not easy for the riders, the team and the bike. But our BMW M 1000 RR was working perfectly over the entire race. Dunlop made a big step, they did a very good job. And all three riders showed a tremendous performance. They did nearly the same lap times as the leaders. Fifth place is the best result for our team here, so I am very proud.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “We can be very satisfied. Fifth place is great and better than expected. Our goal was to improve on our position from last year and finish in the top five. But it was hard to believe because many good teams were participating. However, we managed it on our own, without benefiting from others’ misfortunes. We gave our best and had an extremely good week. Especially for me, things went very well. I was able to improve my personal record in Suzuka twice, by the end even by a whole second. The start was really good, and I was able to ride some great stints. The whole team worked really well. I am just super proud of the entire team for delivering such a good performance. Fifth place also shows the quality of our equipment. I want to thank my teammates and the team, and we can continue like this.”\n\nSylvain Guintoli (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “It was a good performance in the race and a great performance in qualifying by Markus. He rode a beautiful lap, he was very quick. For the race we did not quite know what to expect because the temperatures were very high, and we did not really test in those conditions with the tyres that we used. But it actually worked really well. It was great to be able to maintain that pace and to get home with a very well deserved fifth place. Which, to be very honest, we were not expecting. So it is great, but we are all tired now because it was so challenging as it was so hot.”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “I am really happy, especially for the team. Everyone did a really good job. I struggled a little bit over the weekend as I had missed the test a month ago and, in some areas, I lost a little bit of speed. But anyway, I tried to focus on myself and to have a strong race pace, and I was better than last year, almost by one second. Markus and Sylvain did a really good job, everyone was pushing and we can be happy with the best result for the team and Dunlop in Suzuka.”\n\nHannes Soomer (#95 BMW M 1000 RR, TONE RT SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW): “I am very happy to have won the Superstock class here in Suzuka on my first trip to Japan. We had a trouble-free race, no crashes, no big problems and the entire team did a really good job. I am very, very happy. Thanks to the team and thanks to BMW Motorrad Motorsport that I can be here.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The BMW M 1000 RR has passed the endurance test, and BMW Motorrad Motorsport was more successful at the Suzuka 8 Hours (JPN) within the FIM EWC than ever before.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nDingolfing. BMW Group Plant Dingolfing has today celebrated the official start of production for the new BMW 5 Series Touring. The newcomer is the first premium vehicle in its segment to feature not just a petrol, diesel or plug-in hybrid drive but also a fully electric one. That makes the BMW i5 Touring the fourth all-electric model to enter series production at Plant Dingolfing in not even three years.\n\n“Our BMW 5 Series Touring is especially important for Germany and the European market, and a lot of customers have been waiting for it,” said Plant Director Christoph Schröder. But at the end of May, the wait will be over, because that’s when the new Touring – now in its sixth generation – will reach dealers’ showrooms and the first cars are handed over to customers. The new model is already available to order now.\n\nSince launching the first generation in 1991, Plant Dingolfing in Lower Bavaria has been the sole producer of the BMW 5 Series Touring, with more than 1.2 million rolling off its production lines over the years. Like its predecessor, the new BMW 5 Series Touring – irrespective of drive – is manufactured flexibly alongside the BMW 5 Series Sedan and BMW 4 Series and 6 Series models, all on a single production line. Investments in the plant for the new BMW 5 Series Touring amount to approx. 80 million euros.\n\n“For us here in Dingolfing, the BMW 5 Series is part of our DNA,” explained Plant Director Christoph Schröder, “and the launch of the new Touring represents the next step in the renewal of our successful model series.” Last year BMW 5 Series vehicles accounted for about a third of output from Dingolfing. But with the Touring now available, numbers could rise significantly in 2024, potentially nearing the 50 percent mark.\n\nJulian Friedrich, BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, Head of Press and Public Relations\n\nThomas Niedermeier, BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, Press and Public Relations\n\nInternet: \n\nBMW Group Plant Dingolfing\n\nBMW Group Plant Dingolfing is the BMW Group’s largest European production facility. Every day it produces more than 1,500 vehicles, with the BMW 4 Series, 5 Series, 6 Series, 7 Series, 8 Series and the all-new BMW iX rolling off the production lines.

The ocean rose like a mirage on the horizon. The cold, salty breeze from the Atlantic washed away the dust of the dunes, a welcome reprieve after the unforgiving heat. Here, where the vastness of the Namib Desert meets the endless stretch of ocean, it felt as though we had arrived in a new world—one where sand and sea dance together in perfect contrast, a place where the desert surrenders to the deep blues of the coast.\n\nThe riders awoke to a mild morning, but the tranquility wouldn’t last. The day ahead promised both adventure and challenges as they prepared to leave camp.\n\nShortly after setting off, the route guided them around the rugged beauty of Kleine Spitzkoppe, the smaller sibling of the iconic Spitzkoppe formation. By now, the riders had become familiar with Namibia’s ever-changing landscape. If there were one word to describe the terrain, it would be “unpredictable” — a land where every twist and turn offered a new challenge.\n\nAfter skirting the edges of Kleine Spitzkoppe, through the sweeping expanse of the national park, the riders arrived at the site of their first special challenge of the day. The warm-up was over, and the real test was about to begin.\n\nDay 4, Special Challenge 1: The ADVANTEC Pull Challenge. Emulating every rider’s nightmare—a motorcycle that has run out of gas—this challenge added a tough layer of complexity. The task seemed simple enough: cover 50 meters, but those 50 meters were buried under deep, unforgiving sand.\n\nAt the start, the three riders lined up. The first rider set off quickly, racing through the sand towards the finish line. But as they tore ahead, the real challenge began for the second rider. While battling through the cloud of dust and sand kicked up by the first, the second rider had to attach a towing rope to the third motorcycle and pull it through the sand to the finish.\n\nAs the second rider fought to maintain traction and pull the towed bike forward, the first rider had already arrived at the finish, grabbing a gas can to simulate refueling the third bike. It was a test of coordination, strength, and strategy—made all the more difficult by the sandy conditions and the relentless dust cloud left behind by the first rider’s departure.\n\nRider Taher Altayed (243) of Team Middle East, said: “Super nice special challenge. We had to coordinate with each other and make sure that everybody knew what to do. The plan was very simple. I would ride my bike to the gas can while my teammates would tow the disabled bike. Easy!”\n\nThe riders completed the loop around Kleine Spitzkoppe, a trail that offered a bit of everything. The mostly hardpacked dirt, loose gravel, and rocky terrain kept them focused, while the few dried creek crossings with their sandy beds added just enough unpredictability to keep everyone on their toes.\n\nAs they pushed westward, the road led through small communities, where local residents stood by their handmade roadside stands, waving at the passing riders. The sight of the convoy of motorcycles and support vehicles was a spectacle for the local children, their eyes wide with excitement. Who knows what thoughts ran through their minds—maybe one of them dreamed of becoming a future GS rider, traversing distant lands and taking part in something as grand as the GS Trophy.\n\nThe road from the first special challenge to the lunch break location was manageable, even for the least experienced riders. By now, everyone had found their rhythm, tackling the sand and loose gravel with confidence. Even the steep, rocky uphills didn’t pose the challenge they once did. On their way, the riders passed through an abandoned marble mine, with massive marble blocks scattered across the landscape—a reminder of a once-thriving area that had long since faded away.\n\nAfter a quick but much-needed lunch break, the riders prepared to enter the Khan River Canyon, for a rugged 80-kilometer stretch of terrain that would test their skills and endurance. Plunging into the heart of the canyon, they found themselves surrounded by towering rock walls that rose sharply on either side, their jagged edges casting long shadows across the trail. It was a surreal landscape—majestic, yet unforgiving—signaling the approach of their second and final special challenge of the day.\n\nThe path narrowed as it snaked between the rock formations, forcing the riders to navigate the tight passes carefully. At times, the towering cliffs seemed to close in on them, and the road was a thin thread carved through eons of erosion. The smooth canyon floor gave way to rough patches of loose gravel, with large boulders strewn along the sides, reminding them of nature’s power to both create and destroy.\n\nWith every twist and turn, the canyon revealed a new wonder—massive rock formations that looked as though they had been sculpted by hand, their colors shifting from deep reds to light browns under the changing light. Riding through these towering rock faces, it felt as if the earth itself had split open, creating a natural passageway just for them.\n\nAt certain points, the track widened and narrowed unpredictably, requiring the riders to maintain a careful balance of precision and speed as they navigated through the rugged terrain. The towering rocks and winding paths gave the feeling of riding through a labyrinth carved by time, with each bend offering a new, breathtaking view of the canyon’s dramatic landscape.\n\nThe constant shifting of the road surface—from hard-packed dirt to loose rocks to deep sand—kept everyone focused, and the echo of the motorcycles reverberating off the canyon walls only added to the sense of isolation and adventure.\n\nAs the canyon finally opened up, the riders knew they were emerging from one of the most dramatic and challenging stretches of the day—a place where the raw beauty of Namibia’s terrain had left its mark on both them and their bikes. But there was little time to rest; at the canyon’s exit, the second special challenge awaited, ready to test their endurance once again.\n\nDay 4, Special Challenge 2: Rooi Tafel Trial. Set against the surreal backdrop of towering rock formations, the Rooi Tafel Trial demanded both precision and grit. The three riders began in the start box, with rider one setting off as the clock started. The course was a tough trial section featuring sharp turns, deep sand, and challenging rock climbs. Upon reaching the finish line, rider one would raise their hand, signaling for rider two to start, followed by rider three. Points were deducted for dabs, going out of bounds, or dropping the bike. The riders had to work quickly but carefully, with all three needing to complete the course within a 5-minute limit.\n\nRider Martin Ulreich (252) of the International Male Team, said: “This section was very small and very tight. You must ride very slowly and carefully, and because it was so technical, we couldn’t do it without putting our feet down. We didn’t drop a bike, so we hope our time was good.”\n\nAmong the adrenaline and tough competition, there was a heartwarming moment that truly captured the GS spirit. The riders from Team India, along with their MRP, took a pause to embrace one another in a heartfelt group hug. Grateful for the rare opportunity to be together in Namibia, competing in the GS Trophy, it was a touching reminder of what this event is all about—camaraderie, teamwork, and the bonds that form through shared adventure. It was a genuine demonstration of the GS team spirit, showing that beyond the challenges, the experience of being here together meant everything.\n\nAs the riders emerged from the canyon, the landscape shifted once again. The rocks became sharper and more defined, as if hardened by time, standing tall with a wisdom that seemed ancient and untouchable—as if this was the birthplace of Africa. The journey westward brought not only a change in scenery but a change in the air. The temperature dropped quickly as the cold ocean breeze swept in, a refreshing contrast to the desert heat they had endured all day.\n\nWhen they finally entered Swakopmund, it felt like stepping into a different world. The stark desert gave way to the lively, touristic atmosphere of the coastal town. New houses lined the oceanfront, markets bustled with energy, and the streets buzzed with life. It was as though they had left Namibia behind and crossed into a completely new country.\n\nThe day came to a close with dinner by the ocean, the sound of the waves a soothing backdrop to the evening’s festivities. As the scores for the day were announced, the riders celebrated with laughter and camaraderie, all while preparing for the challenges of the next day—the longest of the GS Trophy, Day 5.\n\nRider Tomas Harrison (122), Team Latin America: “The day was spectacular. The canyon was such a treat. Similar to what we did yesterday, but this one was very narrow, beautiful rocks, such a great experience. We were riding in the middle of very tall rock formations, and a lot of trees, which was rare if you think we’re in the desert. We were riding with team UK and we really bonded. It was such a beautiful ride.”\n\nBMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024, Namibia.\n\nDay Four overall standings:\n\n1. Germany, 155 points\n\n3. International Team, 101\n\n14.

Location: Swakopmund, Namibia Weather: Sunny, 12°C - 32°C Course: 224km: Spitzkoppe – Kleine Spitzkoppe - Khan River - Swakopmund Terrain types: Tarmac 24km, off-road 200km Tests: SP1: ADVANTEC Pull Challenge, SP2: Rooi Tafel Trial Top three teams male: 1. Germany, 2. South Africa, 3. International Team Top three teams female: 1. France, 2. Germany, 3. JapanSwakopmund. The ocean rose like a mirage on the horizon. The cold, salty breeze from the Atlantic washed away the dust of the dunes, a welcome reprieve after the unforgiving heat. Here, where the vastness of the Namib Desert meets the endless stretch of ocean, it felt as though we had arrived in a new world—one where sand and sea dance together in perfect contrast, a place where the desert surrenders to the deep blues of the coast.\n\nThe riders awoke to a mild morning, but the tranquility wouldn’t last. The day ahead promised both adventure and challenges as they prepared to leave camp.\n\nShortly after setting off, the route guided them around the rugged beauty of Kleine Spitzkoppe, the smaller sibling of the iconic Spitzkoppe formation. By now, the riders had become familiar with Namibia’s ever-changing landscape. If there were one word to describe the terrain, it would be “unpredictable” — a land where every twist and turn offered a new challenge.\n\nAfter skirting the edges of Kleine Spitzkoppe, through the sweeping expanse of the national park, the riders arrived at the site of their first special challenge of the day. The warm-up was over, and the real test was about to begin.\n\nDay 4, Special Challenge 1: The ADVANTEC Pull Challenge. Emulating every rider’s nightmare—a motorcycle that has run out of gas—this challenge added a tough layer of complexity. The task seemed simple enough: cover 50 meters, but those 50 meters were buried under deep, unforgiving sand.\n\nAt the start, the three riders lined up. The first rider set off quickly, racing through the sand towards the finish line. But as they tore ahead, the real challenge began for the second rider. While battling through the cloud of dust and sand kicked up by the first, the second rider had to attach a towing rope to the third motorcycle and pull it through the sand to the finish.\n\nAs the second rider fought to maintain traction and pull the towed bike forward, the first rider had already arrived at the finish, grabbing a gas can to simulate refueling the third bike. It was a test of coordination, strength, and strategy—made all the more difficult by the sandy conditions and the relentless dust cloud left behind by the first rider’s departure.\n\nRider Taher Altayed (243) of Team Middle East, said: “Super nice special challenge. We had to coordinate with each other and make sure that everybody knew what to do. The plan was very simple. I would ride my bike to the gas can while my teammates would tow the disabled bike. Easy!”\n\nThe riders completed the loop around Kleine Spitzkoppe, a trail that offered a bit of everything. The mostly hardpacked dirt, loose gravel, and rocky terrain kept them focused, while the few dried creek crossings with their sandy beds added just enough unpredictability to keep everyone on their toes.\n\nAs they pushed westward, the road led through small communities, where local residents stood by their handmade roadside stands, waving at the passing riders. The sight of the convoy of motorcycles and support vehicles was a spectacle for the local children, their eyes wide with excitement. Who knows what thoughts ran through their minds—maybe one of them dreamed of becoming a future GS rider, traversing distant lands and taking part in something as grand as the GS Trophy.\n\nThe road from the first special challenge to the lunch break location was manageable, even for the least experienced riders. By now, everyone had found their rhythm, tackling the sand and loose gravel with confidence. Even the steep, rocky uphills didn’t pose the challenge they once did. On their way, the riders passed through an abandoned marble mine, with massive marble blocks scattered across the landscape—a reminder of a once-thriving area that had long since faded away.\n\nAfter a quick but much-needed lunch break, the riders prepared to enter the Khan River Canyon, for a rugged 80-kilometer stretch of terrain that would test their skills and endurance. Plunging into the heart of the canyon, they found themselves surrounded by towering rock walls that rose sharply on either side, their jagged edges casting long shadows across the trail. It was a surreal landscape—majestic, yet unforgiving—signaling the approach of their second and final special challenge of the day.\n\nThe path narrowed as it snaked between the rock formations, forcing the riders to navigate the tight passes carefully. At times, the towering cliffs seemed to close in on them, and the road was a thin thread carved through eons of erosion. The smooth canyon floor gave way to rough patches of loose gravel, with large boulders strewn along the sides, reminding them of nature’s power to both create and destroy.\n\nWith every twist and turn, the canyon revealed a new wonder—massive rock formations that looked as though they had been sculpted by hand, their colors shifting from deep reds to light browns under the changing light. Riding through these towering rock faces, it felt as if the earth itself had split open, creating a natural passageway just for them.\n\nAt certain points, the track widened and narrowed unpredictably, requiring the riders to maintain a careful balance of precision and speed as they navigated through the rugged terrain. The towering rocks and winding paths gave the feeling of riding through a labyrinth carved by time, with each bend offering a new, breathtaking view of the canyon’s dramatic landscape.\n\nThe constant shifting of the road surface—from hard-packed dirt to loose rocks to deep sand—kept everyone focused, and the echo of the motorcycles reverberating off the canyon walls only added to the sense of isolation and adventure.\n\nAs the canyon finally opened up, the riders knew they were emerging from one of the most dramatic and challenging stretches of the day—a place where the raw beauty of Namibia’s terrain had left its mark on both them and their bikes. But there was little time to rest; at the canyon’s exit, the second special challenge awaited, ready to test their endurance once again.\n\nDay 4, Special Challenge 2: Rooi Tafel Trial. Set against the surreal backdrop of towering rock formations, the Rooi Tafel Trial demanded both precision and grit. The three riders began in the start box, with rider one setting off as the clock started. The course was a tough trial section featuring sharp turns, deep sand, and challenging rock climbs. Upon reaching the finish line, rider one would raise their hand, signaling for rider two to start, followed by rider three. Points were deducted for dabs, going out of bounds, or dropping the bike. The riders had to work quickly but carefully, with all three needing to complete the course within a 5-minute limit.\n\nRider Martin Ulreich (252) of the International Male Team, said: “This section was very small and very tight. You must ride very slowly and carefully, and because it was so technical, we couldn’t do it without putting our feet down. We didn’t drop a bike, so we hope our time was good.”\n\nAmong the adrenaline and tough competition, there was a heartwarming moment that truly captured the GS spirit. The riders from Team India, along with their MRP, took a pause to embrace one another in a heartfelt group hug. Grateful for the rare opportunity to be together in Namibia, competing in the GS Trophy, it was a touching reminder of what this event is all about—camaraderie, teamwork, and the bonds that form through shared adventure. It was a genuine demonstration of the GS team spirit, showing that beyond the challenges, the experience of being here together meant everything.\n\nAs the riders emerged from the canyon, the landscape shifted once again. The rocks became sharper and more defined, as if hardened by time, standing tall with a wisdom that seemed ancient and untouchable—as if this was the birthplace of Africa. The journey westward brought not only a change in scenery but a change in the air. The temperature dropped quickly as the cold ocean breeze swept in, a refreshing contrast to the desert heat they had endured all day.\n\nWhen they finally entered Swakopmund, it felt like stepping into a different world. The stark desert gave way to the lively, touristic atmosphere of the coastal town. New houses lined the oceanfront, markets bustled with energy, and the streets buzzed with life. It was as though they had left Namibia behind and crossed into a completely new country.\n\nThe day came to a close with dinner by the ocean, the sound of the waves a soothing backdrop to the evening’s festivities. As the scores for the day were announced, the riders celebrated with laughter and camaraderie, all while preparing for the challenges of the next day—the longest of the GS Trophy, Day 5.\n\nRider Tomas Harrison (122), Team Latin America: “The day was spectacular.

After ten years, the BMW Championship is returning to Denver. This year's penultimate FedExCup playoff tournament will be played at the Castle Pines Golf Club at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, following Billy Horschel's (USA) win at the Cherry Hills Golf Club in 2014. The top 50 players of this year's PGA TOUR are vying for just 30 tickets to next week’s season finale. A golf tournament can hardly be more star-studded and competitive. Among others, world number one player and Olympic Gold Medallist, Scottie Scheffler, world number-two player and two-time major winner this season, Xander Schauffele (both USA), BMW Championship and FedExCup defending champion Viktor Hovland (NOR), as well as world number-five player, Wyndham Clark (USA), a Colorado native.\n\nThe Gardner Heidrick Pro-Am, which traditionally opens the BMW Championship on Wednesday, was no less star-studded.

All profits from the sale of Pro-Am spots – as well as all proceeds from the tournament – benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF), a foundation of tournament host Western Golf Association. The ESF awards college tuition and housing scholarships for inspiring young caddies from across the country. Since 2007, the BMW Championship has raised more than $50 million in support of the Evans Scholars Foundation, helping over 3,300 students to attend college and follow their dreams.\n\nCurrently, a record 1,190 caddies are enrolled in 24 leading universities as Evans Scholars. “We are very proud to be able to contribute to a successful future for so many students with the BMW Championship. This is exactly the kind of initiative that we as a company want to promote to enable young people to realise their full potential,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, People and Places.\n\nHosted by the Western Golf Association, the BMW Championship is the oldest non-major on the PGA TOUR schedule, dating back to 1899 when it debuted as the Western Open. Not only in terms of sporting value and tradition, the BMW Championship is on par with the majors. This was underscored by the event being named “PGA TOUR Tournament of the Year” for the fifth time after 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2014 last year. The PGA TOUR particularly recognised the premium experience for fans and players, as well as the commitment of the title partner BMW, the tournament organision, and the volunteer helpers.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Touring: Energy consumption, weighted, combined: 2.0 l/100 km [141.2 mpg imp] and 30.7 kWh/ 100 km; CO2 emissions, weighted, combined: 46 g/ km; fuel consumption with discharged battery: 10.9 l/100 km [25.9 mpg imp] in the WLTP cycle; CO2 classes, weighted, combined: B, with discharged battery G."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ The top 50 golfers of the PGA TOUR compete at Castle Pines Golf Club near Denver (Colorado) for just 30 tickets to the season final +++ Gardner Heidrick Pro-Am benefits the Evans Scholars Foundation with Super Bowl and Stanley Cup champions +++ Since 2007, the BMW Championship has generated $50 million for college scholarships +++ The new BMW M5 Touring is this year's hole-in-one prize +++"}]}

Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER), who had started from third place, were also in a promising position but retired due to a technical issue.\n\nIn the GTD class, Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) drove a strong race in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Turner Motorsport, finishing fourth in their class. The IMSA season concludes with two endurance highlights, where the BMW M Hybrid V8 will also be in action: the 6 Hours of Indianapolis (USA) in September and the Petit Le Mans in Road Atlanta (USA) in October.\n\nIMPC (22nd-24th August): Turner Motorsport finishes fourth.

Davis Bryant had a sensational day at the BMW International Open. The American, who is playing his first season on the DP World Tour, started on the 10th hole, made a birdie on the 11th, and then aced the 12th hole (Par 3, 166 yards). He would go on to make eight more birdies, finishing the second round at 12 under par to take the lead. On an otherwise perfect day, the 25-year-old might only regret making his ace on the “wrong” hole. This year’s hole-in-one prize – a BMW M5 Touring – is awarded for an ace on the 17th hole, which remains in play over the weekend.\n\nClosest behind Bryant are Kristoffer Reitan (NOR, -10), along with Yuto Katsuragawa (JPN), Daniel Brown (ENG), and Jordan Smith (ENG), all at -9. “I honestly don’t know what happened today. The hole-in-one really got things going – that’s always incredibly cool,” said Bryant. “I’m just very proud of how I executed everything, stuck to my process, and holed some key putts. That was a big factor. The spark really lit today – and then you just ride that momentum.”\n\nBryant’s ace – contributing to making him the first American since John Daly (2001) who could potentially win the BMW International Open – was one of 28 eagles recorded on Friday. For every eagle made during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group is donating €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint initiative aims to equip children and youth with key life skills in movement, nutrition, and personal development. Heading into the weekend, the donation total already stands at €44,000.\n\nWhile Bryant and Reitan have created a slight gap, the leaderboard remains tightly packed, promising an exciting weekend of golf. A total of 68 players made the cut – including seven Germans. Among the most promising are Marcel Siem (-7, T10), Marcel Schneider, Matti Schmid, and the sensationally performing amateur Tim Wiedemeyer (all -6, T15).\n\nSiem said: “I’m very happy. Apart from the 9th hole, I took advantage of all the chances I had. All in all, I’m really satisfied with my 6-under round today. I don’t think much more was possible – I really got the maximum out of it. My goal is to start the weekend confidently and go at the flags more aggressively when I’m in the fairway. That’s my game plan.”\n\nSchneider was also pleased with his performance: “Today went better than yesterday. The putter got really hot at times. Overall, the ball-striking was better. It wasn’t perfect yet, but overall, I’m satisfied. The four early birdies definitely gave me a push. My plan is to keep playing well, attack the course, and hit a lot of greens. I’ll take it shot by shot and see where that gets me.”\n\nAmateur Tim Wiedemeyer has been playing impressive golf this week. In his hometown, the 20-year-old followed up his even-par opening round with a 66 today and said: “I’m very happy. Six under par is pretty good. I tried to hit a lot of fairways and greens. And when the putter gets hot, you shoot a good score. The support – especially on the back nine – was really cool. It felt more like an evening round with friends. That definitely helped my game today. Now, I just want to have fun. The cut is made – let’s see what happens and enjoy it.”\n\nFor Martin Kaymer (-4, T37), the dream of a second win in Munich after 2008 is still alive – albeit with a steep task ahead, sitting seven shots behind the leader. The two-time Major champion said: “Overall, I was satisfied with my game and hit a lot of good shots, but I didn’t take advantage of the par-5s.

Davis Bryant had a sensational day at the BMW International Open. The American, who is playing his first season on the DP World Tour, started on the 10th hole, made a birdie on the 11th, and then aced the 12th hole (Par 3, 166 yards). He would go on to make eight more birdies, finishing the second round at 12 under par to take the lead. On an otherwise perfect day, the 25-year-old might only regret making his ace on the “wrong” hole. This year’s hole-in-one prize – a BMW M5 Touring – is awarded for an ace on the 17th hole, which remains in play over the weekend.\n\nClosest behind Bryant are Kristoffer Reitan (NOR, -10), along with Yuto Katsuragawa (JPN), Daniel Brown (ENG), and Jordan Smith (ENG), all at -9. “I honestly don’t know what happened today. The hole-in-one really got things going – that’s always incredibly cool,” said Bryant. “I’m just very proud of how I executed everything, stuck to my process, and holed some key putts. That was a big factor. The spark really lit today – and then you just ride that momentum.”\n\nBryant’s ace – contributing to making him the first American since John Daly (2001) who could potentially win the BMW International Open – was one of 28 eagles recorded on Friday. For every eagle made during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group is donating €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint initiative aims to equip children and youth with key life skills in movement, nutrition, and personal development. Heading into the weekend, the donation total already stands at €44,000.\n\nWhile Bryant and Reitan have created a slight gap, the leaderboard remains tightly packed, promising an exciting weekend of golf. A total of 68 players made the cut – including seven Germans. Among the most promising are Marcel Siem (-7, T10), Marcel Schneider, Matti Schmid, and the sensationally performing amateur Tim Wiedemeyer (all -6, T15).\n\nSiem said: “I’m very happy. Apart from the 9th hole, I took advantage of all the chances I had. All in all, I’m really satisfied with my 6-under round today. I don’t think much more was possible – I really got the maximum out of it. My goal is to start the weekend confidently and go at the flags more aggressively when I’m in the fairway. That’s my game plan.”\n\nSchneider was also pleased with his performance: “Today went better than yesterday. The putter got really hot at times. Overall, the ball-striking was better. It wasn’t perfect yet, but overall, I’m satisfied. The four early birdies definitely gave me a push. My plan is to keep playing well, attack the course, and hit a lot of greens. I’ll take it shot by shot and see where that gets me.”\n\nAmateur Tim Wiedemeyer has been playing impressive golf this week. In his hometown, the 20-year-old followed up his even-par opening round with a 66 today and said: “I’m very happy. Six under par is pretty good. I tried to hit a lot of fairways and greens. And when the putter gets hot, you shoot a good score. The support – especially on the back nine – was really cool. It felt more like an evening round with friends. That definitely helped my game today. Now, I just want to have fun. The cut is made – let’s see what happens and enjoy it.”\n\nFor Martin Kaymer (-4, T37), the dream of a second win in Munich after 2008 is still alive – albeit with a steep task ahead, sitting seven shots behind the leader. The two-time Major champion said: “Overall, I was satisfied with my game and hit a lot of good shots, but I didn’t take advantage of the par-5s. Those are the real birdie chances this week, and I missed out there. On this course – especially if the weather is good – you can really go low. Marcel proved that today.

The new BMW X3 is sportier and more versatile than ever as an all-rounder for everyday use, leisure and travel. In its fourth model generation, a new design language gives it a significantly enhanced presence. The M Sport Package and the M Sport Package Pro are available ex works for an even more elegant and sporty appearance. In addition, the distinctive profile of the Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) can be further customised with the BMW M Performance Parts, which will be available for the new BMW X3.\n\nThe model-specific retrofit products for the new BMW X3 are manufactured in a complex process from carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), high-strength aramid or high-gloss polyurethane and are perfectly matched to one another. All add-on parts from the original BMW accessories range perfectly match the geometry and monolithic appearance of the new BMW X3.\n\nConfident appearance and optimised aerodynamic properties: M Performance front splitter.\n\nThe exterior components, which are precisely tailored to the new BMW X3, not only set individual accents of elegant sportiness, but also fulfil functional requirements in terms of lightweight construction and aerodynamics. In the fourth model generation, an M Performance front splitter is now available for the first time for the SAV. It complements the exterior features of the M Sport Package and emphasises the striking lines of the front apron. Finished in high-gloss black, the three-part front splitter gives the SAV a decidedly distinctive appearance, especially when combined with the M Performance front ornamental grille painted in the same colour.\n\nThe exclusive M Performance side decals in Frozen Black also emphasise the sporty character of the new BMW X3 from the side. The light-, weather- and wash-resistant decal set is perfectly adapted to the vehicle's geometry and makes a clear reference to motorsport. The M Performance Carbon fuel filler cap with M Performance lettering on brushed aluminium makes an unmistakable statement at the fuel station.\n\nThe striking M Carbon exterior mirror caps and the M Performance aerial cover in aramid are further accents that lend the profile of the new BMW X3 an individual and sporty touch. The aramid-reinforced plastic is very similar to carbon fibre, but offers greater electromagnetic permeability, ensuring unrestricted reception when making calls and using the many digital services available.\n\nStriking sportiness: M Performance rear diffuser, M Performance roof edge spoiler and M Performance tailpipe trims.\n\nThe M Performance rear diffuser is also made from this high-tech material. It gives an even more striking appearance to the rear of the car, which is already characterised by its generous surfaces, and, in conjunction with the Comfort Access system, allows the luggage compartment lid to be opened and closed without the need for physical contact. An optional M Performance rear diffuser in high-gloss black polyurethane is also available for the new BMW X3. Both versions of the rear diffuser are combined with the M Performance rear bumper trim in high-gloss black.\n\nThe M Performance roof edge spoiler is also made of polyurethane and is finished in high-gloss black. Perfectly tailored to the design of the vehicle, it not only optimises the aerodynamic properties of the new BMW X3, but also adds a particularly dynamic touch to the rear of the vehicle. If desired, it can be painted in the colour of the vehicle.\n\nThe M model badge \"X3\" in high-gloss black on the rear of the new BMW X3 also sets an exclusive visual accent. The M model badge \"M50\" is also available in a high-gloss black finish for the M Performance model.\n\nUp to 22-inch light alloy wheels are available for an even more exclusive look.\n\nA further highlight in the range of accessories for the new BMW X3 are the weight-optimised 22-inch M Performance light-alloy wheels. The complete summer wheel set is available exclusively in Bicolour Jetblack matt finish. The Y-spoke light alloy wheels feature polished elements on the outer rim and centre for a particularly exclusive look.\n\nIn addition, 20-inch M Performance Y-spoke wheels in Jet Black Matt are available as both a summer and winter complete wheel set. Additional wheel sets are ideally stowed in the M Performance tyre bags. Reinforced bag handles make it easy to transport the wheels.\n\nPrecisely honed racing flair also for the interior.\n\nAs soon as the doors are opened, the M Performance Carbon door sills unmistakably signal the new BMW X3's dynamic orientation. With their distinctive M Performance lettering, they are an individual eye-catcher. Alternatively, M aluminium door sill trims are also available for the new edition of the SAV.\n\nAuthentic motorsport flair can also be found in the footwell of the new BMW X3 with the stainless steel M Performance pedal cover. The M Performance floor mats are the ideal complement. The four-piece set features embroidered M Performance lettering, leather-look edging, contrasting stitching and a stitched-in ribbon in BMW M colours.\n\nThe M Performance key case, with its mix of Alcantara and carbon-look leather, also conveys a subtle hint of performance passion outside the vehicle.

The new BMW X3 is sportier and more versatile than ever as an all-rounder for everyday use, leisure and travel. In its fourth model generation, a new design language gives it a significantly enhanced presence. The M Sport Package and the M Sport Package Pro are available ex works for an even more elegant and sporty appearance. In addition, the distinctive profile of the Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) can be further customised with the BMW M Performance Parts, which will be available for the new BMW X3.\n\nThe model-specific retrofit products for the new BMW X3 are manufactured in a complex process from carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), high-strength aramid or high-gloss polyurethane and are perfectly matched to one another. All add-on parts from the original BMW accessories range perfectly match the geometry and monolithic appearance of the new BMW X3.\n\nConfident appearance and optimised aerodynamic properties: M Performance front splitter.\n\nThe exterior components, which are precisely tailored to the new BMW X3, not only set individual accents of elegant sportiness, but also fulfil functional requirements in terms of lightweight construction and aerodynamics. In the fourth model generation, an M Performance front splitter is now available for the first time for the SAV. It complements the exterior features of the M Sport Package and emphasises the striking lines of the front apron. Finished in high-gloss black, the three-part front splitter gives the SAV a decidedly distinctive appearance, especially when combined with the M Performance front ornamental grille painted in the same colour.\n\nThe exclusive M Performance side decals in Frozen Black also emphasise the sporty character of the new BMW X3 from the side. The light-, weather- and wash-resistant decal set is perfectly adapted to the vehicle's geometry and makes a clear reference to motorsport. The M Performance Carbon fuel filler cap with M Performance lettering on brushed aluminium makes an unmistakable statement at the fuel station.\n\nThe striking M Carbon exterior mirror caps and the M Performance aerial cover in aramid are further accents that lend the profile of the new BMW X3 an individual and sporty touch. The aramid-reinforced plastic is very similar to carbon fibre, but offers greater electromagnetic permeability, ensuring unrestricted reception when making calls and using the many digital services available.\n\nStriking sportiness: M Performance rear diffuser, M Performance roof edge spoiler and M Performance tailpipe trims.\n\nThe M Performance rear diffuser is also made from this high-tech material. It gives an even more striking appearance to the rear of the car, which is already characterised by its generous surfaces, and, in conjunction with the Comfort Access system, allows the luggage compartment lid to be opened and closed without the need for physical contact. An optional M Performance rear diffuser in high-gloss black polyurethane is also available for the new BMW X3. Both versions of the rear diffuser are combined with the M Performance rear bumper trim in high-gloss black.\n\nThe M Performance roof edge spoiler is also made of polyurethane and is finished in high-gloss black. Perfectly tailored to the design of the vehicle, it not only optimises the aerodynamic properties of the new BMW X3, but also adds a particularly dynamic touch to the rear of the vehicle. If desired, it can be painted in the colour of the vehicle.\n\nThe M model badge \"X3\" in high-gloss black on the rear of the new BMW X3 also sets an exclusive visual accent. The M model badge \"M50\" is also available in a high-gloss black finish for the M Performance model.\n\nUp to 22-inch light alloy wheels are available for an even more exclusive look.\n\nA further highlight in the range of accessories for the new BMW X3 are the weight-optimised 22-inch M Performance light-alloy wheels. The complete summer wheel set is available exclusively in Bicolour Jetblack matt finish. The Y-spoke light alloy wheels feature polished elements on the outer rim and centre for a particularly exclusive look.\n\nIn addition, 20-inch M Performance Y-spoke wheels in Jet Black Matt are available as both a summer and winter complete wheel set. Additional wheel sets are ideally stowed in the M Performance tyre bags. Reinforced bag handles make it easy to transport the wheels.\n\nPrecisely honed racing flair also for the interior.\n\nAs soon as the doors are opened, the M Performance Carbon door sills unmistakably signal the new BMW X3's dynamic orientation. With their distinctive M Performance lettering, they are an individual eye-catcher. Alternatively, M aluminium door sill trims are also available for the new edition of the SAV.\n\nAuthentic motorsport flair can also be found in the footwell of the new BMW X3 with the stainless steel M Performance pedal cover. The M Performance floor mats are the ideal complement.

This results from the focused implementation of our strategic priorities.\n\nAt the BMW Group, we have strong brands and attractive products, which create ongoing high demand and a profitable operational business.\n\nSLIDE 3: Highlights of BMW Group Performance in Q1 2024\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered just under 595,000 vehicles to customers. This is a slight increase of 1.1 percent over the same period of last year.\n\nOur all-electric vehicles, in particular, made an important contribution, with growth of 27.9 percent.\n\nIf we look at the BMW brand alone, that number was 40.6 percent.\n\nAt the same time, sales of models in the upper premium segment also recorded significant double-digit growth of more than 21 percent.\n\nThe Group EBT margin for the first quarter came in at 11.4 percent, which is above our strategic target of 10 percent.\n\nThe EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment was 8.8 percent. This falls clearly within our target corridor of 8 to 10 percent.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis quarter confirms once again that the BMW Group's operating business consistently delivers strong results.\n\nWe have a clearly defined long-term plan. And we have significant flexibility in our systems and processes. This allows us to adapt quickly to developments and take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nOn this basis, we expect to operate at a consistent level throughout 2024.\n\nSLIDE 4: BMW Group in Q1\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the first quarter in more detail.\n\nI’ll start with a brief overview at Group level.\n\nBMW Group revenues were on par with the previous year.\n\nGroup earnings before tax totalled around 4.2 billion euros, resulting in a Group EBT margin of 11.4 percent.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nAnd now more details on how the Automotive Segment performed across key metrics.\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered 595,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers.\n\nThe BMW brand reported growth of 2.5 percent.\n\nDue to the upcoming model changeovers MINI sales were down 9.4 percent from the previous year. The New MINI Family, comprising the Countryman*, the Cooper* and the Aceman*, will boost MINI sales – particularly in the second half of the year.\n\nThis sales development is also reflected in segment revenues. Adjusted for currency translation effects, revenues saw a slight increase of 1.5 percent.\n\nBoth the higher sales volume and positive product mix effects from the upper price segment and BEV contributed to the increase in revenues in Q1 2024.\n\nThis is expected to provide a tailwind for revenues also in the remainder of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, prices across the product portfolio are expected to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nThe electrification of our product line-up continued to generate substantial sales momentum in the most recent quarter.\n\nAlmost 83,000 fully-electric vehicles were sold – or 13.9 percent of our total sales.\n\nTaken together, BEV and plug-in hybrids accounted for about 21 percent of total sales in the first quarter.\n\nEBIT for the period from January to March was 2.7 billion euros, with an EBIT margin of 8.8 percent.\n\nThis means that the first quarter of 2024 is in line with the consistent trend in profitability since the beginning of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 was exceptional, as the effects of inflation were not yet fully reflected in the operating result.\n\nI will provide more details on the Q1 year-on-year development with the EBIT bridge.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q1\n\nChanges in commodity prices accounted for a positive impact of around 200 million euros. Currency effects remained neutral.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model-mix and pricing effects is about 300 million euros lower than for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIncrease in volumes made a slight positive contribution.\n\nThe double-digit growth by models in the upper price segment almost entirely compensated the effect from the higher BEV share.\n\nStarting with the second quarter of 2023, we began to see increased competition due to better availability of vehicles in the market. This led to a gradual softening of the global price environment for new and used cars, which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect the net effect from volume, mix and pricing to be slightly positive, as planned.\n\nWe expect additional momentum from models like the new BMW 5 Series, which is currently ramping up in markets across the globe. In China, it launched after the Lunar New Year holiday and has therefore only been in showrooms for a few weeks.\n\nFull availability of the BMW 7 Series will also have a positive effect.\n\nMoving on, we come to research and development expenses – which were 200 million euros higher than in the prior-year first quarter.\n\nBased on Group R&D expenditure, the R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code came in at 5.4 percent.\n\nOur R&D activities remain focused on the electrification and digitalisation of our entire vehicle fleet. We are constantly developing attractive new models, like the NEUE KLASSE or the next generation of the BMW X5.\n\nSales and administrative costs were 100 million euros higher than the previous year. This is largely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe headwind of 700 million euros from Other Cost Changes essentially results from two areas.\n\nThe first is manufacturing costs.\n\nSales margins in the first quarter of 2023 still benefitted from a lower level of purchasing prices in 2022.\n\nThis led to a positive EBIT effect in Q1 2023 as inventories with lower manufacturing costs were sold.\n\nStarting in Q2 2023, we saw an elevation in costs that has carried through into Q1 2024.\n\nAnother reason for the difference in other cost changes is income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles.\n\nAs expected, income was lower than in the first quarter of 2023, yet remains positive.\n\nThe normalisation we have been seeing in the used car market over the past twelve to fifteen months has gradually continued.\n\nSLIDE 7: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q1\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled about 1.3 billion euros in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe difference to the first quarter of 2023 mainly results from the lower EBT.\n\nInventory levels rose during the first quarter, in line with planning. This contributed to the change in working capital, which amounts to 1.2 billion euros.\n\nThe increase in stock will ensure that we can service the expected customer demand.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation also reduced free cash flow by 200 million euros.\n\nCapital expenditure for January to March totalled around 1.3 billion euros. This was mainly allocated to new models and structures, with a clear focus on electrification and digitalisation as well as automated driving systems.\n\nThe capex ratio for the year to the end of March was 3.6 percent.\n\nChanges in provisions and in the position other, such as tax payments, had no net impact on free cash flow.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, investments totalling 2.3 billion euros were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, the Automotive segment generated 1.3 billion euros in free cashflow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cashflow above 6 billion euros in the Automotive segment, despite the planned peak investments in R&D and capex in 2024.\n\nThe strong underlying free cashflow generation supports our ongoing and consistent shareholder return.\n\nAs part of the share buyback program BMW AG has acquired shares equivalent to 5.03 percent of the share capital in place on March 31st.\n\nThe second tranche of the second program with a volume of 500 million euros is currently in progress and will be completed no later than June 28th.\n\nCurrently we see no reason not to continue with tranche three immediately after conclusion of tranche two.\n\nSLIDE 8: Financial Services Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the positive trend in new business from the second half of 2023 continued through the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe number of new contracts concluded with retail customers increased significantly by 21.5 percent year-on-year to reach 422,000 contracts. Financing for both new and used vehicles contributed to this growth.\n\nIn line with this, the volume of new business grew by 22.1 percent to just over 15.6 billion euros.\n\nSegment earnings for the first quarter amounted to 730 million euros – a decrease of 215 million from the previous year.\n\nThis can be attributed both to higher credit risk provisioning and the normalisation of income from the resale of lease returns.\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained at a low rate of 0.21 percent.\n\nSLIDE 9: Motorcycles Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, first-quarter deliveries decreased slightly by 3.1 percent year-on-year.\n\nEBIT for the year to the end of March totalled 106 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 12.2 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAfter a successful first quarter, we expect the solid business performance to continue throughout the year 2024.\n\nTherefore, our guidance for key performance indicators remains unchanged.\n\nThis is based on the assumption that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions do not deteriorate.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are projected to decrease slightly.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment, we are planning for slight year-on-year sales growth – with the percentage of all-electric vehicles set to increase significantly.\n\nWe expect to see an EBIT margin of between 8 and 10 percent and a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) of between 15 and 20 percent.\n\nSales should be slightly higher in the Motorcycles Segment, too. The segment's EBIT margin should come in at between 8 and 10 percent and Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) should be between 21 and 26 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, we are targeting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 14 to 17 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 11: BMW Group with Consistent Performance\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group combines a robust financial performance in its current business with a long-term perspective for the future.\n\nWe have a range of highly attractive products in the market and we are continuously developing new models that will set the standard for driving experience, digitalisation and connectivity.\n\nAs planned for and previously announced, our research and development spending, and our capital expenditure, will respectively peak in 2024.\n\nWe expect our R&D ratio for the full year to be above 5 percent, and the capex ratio above 6 percent.\n\nOur underlying profitability allows us to finance these investments in the future and at the same time yield attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nWe continue to steer the company in line with our strategic priorities. And we deliver what we promise.\n\nOur flexibility allows us to quickly adapt to market fluctuations and to meet customer demand across the globe.\n\nThis ensures that we capitalize on market developments and deliver strong results through consistent execution.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Countryman: energy consumption combined in l/100km: 6,2; CO2 emissions combined g/km: 141; CO2 class E MINI Cooper 3-Türer: energy consumption combined in l/100km: 6,4; CO2 emissions combined g/km: 144; CO2 class E MINI Aceman E: electricity consumption combined: 14,7 – 14,1 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 298 - 310"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Walter Mertl Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Conference Call Quarterly Statement to 31 March 2024"}]}

This is a slight increase of 1.1 percent over the same period of last year.\n\nOur all-electric vehicles, in particular, made an important contribution, with growth of 27.9 percent.\n\nIf we look at the BMW brand alone, that number was 40.6 percent.\n\nAt the same time, sales of models in the upper premium segment also recorded significant double-digit growth of more than 21 percent.\n\nThe Group EBT margin for the first quarter came in at 11.4 percent, which is above our strategic target of 10 percent.\n\nThe EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment was 8.8 percent. This falls clearly within our target corridor of 8 to 10 percent.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis quarter confirms once again that the BMW Group's operating business consistently delivers strong results.\n\nWe have a clearly defined long-term plan. And we have significant flexibility in our systems and processes. This allows us to adapt quickly to developments and take advantage of market opportunities.\n\nOn this basis, we expect to operate at a consistent level throughout 2024.\n\nSLIDE 4: BMW Group in Q1\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the first quarter in more detail.\n\nI’ll start with a brief overview at Group level.\n\nBMW Group revenues were on par with the previous year.\n\nGroup earnings before tax totalled around 4.2 billion euros, resulting in a Group EBT margin of 11.4 percent.\n\nSLIDE 5: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT\n\nAnd now more details on how the Automotive Segment performed across key metrics.\n\nIn the first three months, the BMW Group delivered 595,000 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers.\n\nThe BMW brand reported growth of 2.5 percent.\n\nDue to the upcoming model changeovers MINI sales were down 9.4 percent from the previous year. The New MINI Family, comprising the Countryman*, the Cooper* and the Aceman*, will boost MINI sales – particularly in the second half of the year.\n\nThis sales development is also reflected in segment revenues. Adjusted for currency translation effects, revenues saw a slight increase of 1.5 percent.\n\nBoth the higher sales volume and positive product mix effects from the upper price segment and BEV contributed to the increase in revenues in Q1 2024.\n\nThis is expected to provide a tailwind for revenues also in the remainder of 2024.\n\nFurthermore, prices across the product portfolio are expected to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nThe electrification of our product line-up continued to generate substantial sales momentum in the most recent quarter.\n\nAlmost 83,000 fully-electric vehicles were sold – or 13.9 percent of our total sales.\n\nTaken together, BEV and plug-in hybrids accounted for about 21 percent of total sales in the first quarter.\n\nEBIT for the period from January to March was 2.7 billion euros, with an EBIT margin of 8.8 percent.\n\nThis means that the first quarter of 2024 is in line with the consistent trend in profitability since the beginning of 2022.\n\nQ1 2023 was exceptional, as the effects of inflation were not yet fully reflected in the operating result.\n\nI will provide more details on the Q1 year-on-year development with the EBIT bridge.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q1\n\nChanges in commodity prices accounted for a positive impact of around 200 million euros. Currency effects remained neutral.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model-mix and pricing effects is about 300 million euros lower than for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIncrease in volumes made a slight positive contribution.\n\nThe double-digit growth by models in the upper price segment almost entirely compensated the effect from the higher BEV share.\n\nStarting with the second quarter of 2023, we began to see increased competition due to better availability of vehicles in the market. This led to a gradual softening of the global price environment for new and used cars, which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect the net effect from volume, mix and pricing to be slightly positive, as planned.\n\nWe expect additional momentum from models like the new BMW 5 Series, which is currently ramping up in markets across the globe. In China, it launched after the Lunar New Year holiday and has therefore only been in showrooms for a few weeks.\n\nFull availability of the BMW 7 Series will also have a positive effect.\n\nMoving on, we come to research and development expenses – which were 200 million euros higher than in the prior-year first quarter.\n\nBased on Group R&D expenditure, the R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code came in at 5.4 percent.\n\nOur R&D activities remain focused on the electrification and digitalisation of our entire vehicle fleet. We are constantly developing attractive new models, like the NEUE KLASSE or the next generation of the BMW X5.\n\nSales and administrative costs were 100 million euros higher than the previous year. This is largely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe headwind of 700 million euros from Other Cost Changes essentially results from two areas.\n\nThe first is manufacturing costs.\n\nSales margins in the first quarter of 2023 still benefitted from a lower level of purchasing prices in 2022.\n\nThis led to a positive EBIT effect in Q1 2023 as inventories with lower manufacturing costs were sold.\n\nStarting in Q2 2023, we saw an elevation in costs that has carried through into Q1 2024.\n\nAnother reason for the difference in other cost changes is income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles.\n\nAs expected, income was lower than in the first quarter of 2023, yet remains positive.\n\nThe normalisation we have been seeing in the used car market over the past twelve to fifteen months has gradually continued.\n\nSLIDE 7: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q1\n\nFree cashflow in the Automotive Segment totalled about 1.3 billion euros in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe difference to the first quarter of 2023 mainly results from the lower EBT.\n\nInventory levels rose during the first quarter, in line with planning. This contributed to the change in working capital, which amounts to 1.2 billion euros.\n\nThe increase in stock will ensure that we can service the expected customer demand.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation also reduced free cash flow by 200 million euros.\n\nCapital expenditure for January to March totalled around 1.3 billion euros. This was mainly allocated to new models and structures, with a clear focus on electrification and digitalisation as well as automated driving systems.\n\nThe capex ratio for the year to the end of March was 3.6 percent.\n\nChanges in provisions and in the position other, such as tax payments, had no net impact on free cash flow.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, investments totalling 2.3 billion euros were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, the Automotive segment generated 1.3 billion euros in free cashflow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cashflow above 6 billion euros in the Automotive segment, despite the planned peak investments in R&D and capex in 2024.\n\nThe strong underlying free cashflow generation supports our ongoing and consistent shareholder return.\n\nAs part of the share buyback program BMW AG has acquired shares equivalent to 5.03 percent of the share capital in place on March 31st.\n\nThe second tranche of the second program with a volume of 500 million euros is currently in progress and will be completed no later than June 28th.\n\nCurrently we see no reason not to continue with tranche three immediately after conclusion of tranche two.\n\nSLIDE 8: Financial Services Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the positive trend in new business from the second half of 2023 continued through the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe number of new contracts concluded with retail customers increased significantly by 21.5 percent year-on-year to reach 422,000 contracts. Financing for both new and used vehicles contributed to this growth.\n\nIn line with this, the volume of new business grew by 22.1 percent to just over 15.6 billion euros.\n\nSegment earnings for the first quarter amounted to 730 million euros – a decrease of 215 million from the previous year.\n\nThis can be attributed both to higher credit risk provisioning and the normalisation of income from the resale of lease returns.\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained at a low rate of 0.21 percent.\n\nSLIDE 9: Motorcycles Segment in Q1\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, first-quarter deliveries decreased slightly by 3.1 percent year-on-year.\n\nEBIT for the year to the end of March totalled 106 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 12.2 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAfter a successful first quarter, we expect the solid business performance to continue throughout the year 2024.\n\nTherefore, our guidance for key performance indicators remains unchanged.\n\nThis is based on the assumption that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions do not deteriorate.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are projected to decrease slightly.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment, we are planning for slight year-on-year sales growth – with the percentage of all-electric vehicles set to increase significantly.\n\nWe expect to see an EBIT margin of between 8 and 10 percent and a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) of between 15 and 20 percent.\n\nSales should be slightly higher in the Motorcycles Segment, too. The segment's EBIT margin should come in at between 8 and 10 percent and Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) should be between 21 and 26 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, we are targeting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 14 to 17 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 11: BMW Group with Consistent Performance\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group combines a robust financial performance in its current business with a long-term perspective for the future.\n\nWe have a range of highly attractive products in the market and we are continuously developing new models that will set the standard for driving experience, digitalisation and connectivity.\n\nAs planned for and previously announced, our research and development spending, and our capital expenditure, will respectively peak in 2024.\n\nWe expect our R&D ratio for the full year to be above 5 percent, and the capex ratio above 6 percent.\n\nOur underlying profitability allows us to finance these investments in the future and at the same time yield attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nWe continue to steer the company in line with our strategic priorities. And we deliver what we promise.\n\nOur flexibility allows us to quickly adapt to market fluctuations and to meet customer demand across the globe.\n\nThis ensures that we capitalize on market developments and deliver strong results through consistent execution.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Countryman: energy consumption combined in l/100km: 6,2; CO2 emissions combined g/km: 141; CO2 class E MINI Cooper 3-Türer: energy consumption combined in l/100km: 6,4; CO2 emissions combined g/km: 144; CO2 class E MINI Aceman E: electricity consumption combined: 14,7 – 14,1 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 298 - 310"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finance, Facts, Figures, Corporate, Board Member Speeches, Corporate Events"}]}

The new BMW M4 GT4 of the G82 model series celebrated impressive successes in its first season in the hands of BMW M Motorsport teams around the world. In total, the car achieved more than 180 podium finishes, including more than 70 class victories.

The pleasingly long list of major successes includes: the SP10 class victory for FK Performance Motorsport at the 24h Nürburgring (GER), the SP10 overall victory in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), the title win in the GT4 European Series for Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport, the title wins for Turner Motorsport in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge and the IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge, the title win for Auto Technic Racing in the GT4 America, and the title win in the GT4 Asia for YZ Racing with BMW Team Studie.\n\n“What a debut year for the new BMW M4 GT4! We were confident enough before the season to assume that we could continue the successes of its predecessor with this car, but the large number of victories and title wins that our teams and drivers were able to achieve right away was even a positive surprise for us,” said Björn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport. “However, we are not settling on these successes. Due to the high demand, we are currently producing 50 additional units of the BMW M4 GT4, which will be delivered to our customers in 2024.

The BMW Group continues its successful course in 2024: parallel to its dynamic BEV ramp-up, the company achieved its margin targets. In the first three months of the year, the company delivered around 83,000 all-electric vehicles from its BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands and increased BEV sales by around 28 percent. The BMW brand overall increased its sales by 2.5%. At the same time, the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment of 8.8 percent was within the target range of 8-10 percent, according to the full-year guidance. At 11.4 percent, the EBT margin at Group level was above the strategic target of >10 percent.\n\nAfter the challenges of the corona pandemic and semiconductor availability, the company has consistently delivered quarter by quarter within its 8-10% strategic EBIT corridor since Q1 2022. This has been achieved in parallel to its rapid ramp-up of electric mobility: Over the past two years, the BMW Group delivered more than 1.1 million electrified vehicles to customers. More than 60 percent of these were purely electric BEV models. The BEV share continues to rise steadily, as planned.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the EBIT margin of Automotive segment was 12.1%. The EBIT of previous year’s first quarter benefited from the lower purchase price level of 2022, as inventories with lower manufacturing costs were sold. The inflation-related increase in manufacturing costs impacted the profit & loss statement of BMW AG after the second quarter of 2023. The higher cost level has carried through into Q1/2024.\n\n“The past nine quarters underline BMW’s continuity and reliability: As planned, we are dynamically expanding the share of electric vehicles while maintaining our high level of profitability. Some call this transformation — for us, it is continuous progress,” said the Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Oliver Zipse, on Wednesday. “We will remain on this course: We offer our customers the latest innovations and the latest technology — across all vehicle drivetrains. As a result, we continue to generate strong demand with strong products.”\n\nAutomotive markets on upward trend – BMW Group deliveries increase\n\nWith a total of 594,533 automobiles delivered to customers in the first three months, the company posted a slight growth of 1.1% compared to the previous year and reaffirmed its leading position in the global premium segment.\n\nThroughout the three-month period, the major automotive markets largely showed an upward trend based on catch-up purchases and increased sales in the mid-price volume segment. The BMW Group benefited with its young and highly attractive product line-up: The BMW brand sold 530,933 units in the first quarter – an increase of +2.5% year-on-year. It achieved sales growth of 2.4% (84,475 units) in the USA and significant growth of 10.2% in Europe with 188,863 units delivered. In China, the volume segment developed dynamically in lower price ranges, while the premium segment declined slightly. The BMW brand sold 182,998 vehicles, in line with segment development (2023: 190,774 units/-4.1%). In Germany, deliveries grew by 4.6% to 49,509 premium vehicles.\n\nThe popular BMW i4*, as well as the BMW iX1* and BMW i7*, were among the biggest growth drivers of the 78,682 BMW BEVs delivered. The BMW brand’s fully-electric vehicles saw particularly strong growth of +40.6%. A total of 122,582 BMW Group electrified vehicles, BEVs and PHEVs, were delivered to customers, which represents a sales share of almost 21%.\n\nFurther sales momentum is expected over the course of the year from the BMW iX2* and BMW i5*, which are currently ramping up.\n\nFully-electric models increased to 13.9% of total sales (2023: 11.0%). Once again, the models of upper price segments also proved to be important growth drivers – with deliveries up 21.6%.\n\nThe MINI brand is undergoing a comprehensive model changeover. For the first time, the new MINI Countryman*, was recently launched with a pure-electric drive train alongside the familiar internal combustion engine. This will be followed by the new MINI Cooper*, which comes in mid Q2 with a combustion engine or as a fully-electric vehicle. The all electric MINI Aceman* recently celebrated its world premiere at the Beijing Motor Show and is the brand’s first cross-over model for the premium small car segment. These new models are expected to deliver additional momentum from 2nd half of 2024. MINI delivered 62,075 vehicles to customers in Q1 (2023: 68,541 units/-9.4%).\n\nThe Rolls-Royce brand made an impressive e-mobility debut with the Rolls-Royce Spectre*: In the first quarter of 2024 alone, the Rolls-Royce luxury brand handed over 579 fully-electric super coupés to their new owners; 38% of the total 1,525 cars delivered were electrified (2023: 1,640 automotive/-7.0%).\n\nCurrency-adjusted Group revenues increased slightly\n\nFirst-quarter Group revenues totalled € 36,614 millionand were, therefore, on par with the previous year’s record high (2023: € 36,853 million/-0.6%). Group revenues were buoyed by higher sales volumes and a more favourable product mix.\n\nGroup EBT margin outperforms target of >10%\n\nBetween January and March, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 4,162 mi llion(2023: € 5,129 million/-18.9%). The EBT includes a financial result of € 108 million (2023: € -246 million), which reflects the market development in interest rate and currency hedging transactions. The EBT margin for this period was 11.4% (2023: 13.9%) and was above the >10% full year target. Group net profit for the first quarter totalled € 2,951 million (2023: € 3,662 million/-19.4%).\n\nBMW AG continues its share buyback programme\n\nWith the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 11 May 2022, the company initiated the purchase of shares. Shares purchased in programme one have already been cancelled. As of 31 March 2024, BMW AG holds 8,004,314 treasury shares, with a nominal value of € 8,004,314. Based on this authorisation, BMW AG purchased shares equivalent to 5.03% of the share capital as of March 31, 2024.\n\n8.8% Automotive Segment EBIT margin within full-year target range\n\nThe Automotive Segment earned revenues of € 30,939 million in the first quarter (2023: € 31,268 million/-1.1%). Excluding currency translation headwinds, especially from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar, revenues posted year-on-year growth of +1.5%. Higher sales volumes and more favourable product mix effects from the upper price segment and BEV bolstered segment revenues, underscoring the robust operating performance of the core business. Prices across the product range are expected in 2024 to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nThe Ea rnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 2,710 million for the first quarter (2023: € 3,777 million/-28.2%). The auto EBIT margin came in at 8.8% (2023: 12.1%) and was thus within the full-year target range of 8-10%. EBIT was impacted by higher manufacturing costs. As mentioned before, Q1 2023 had still benefited from the lower level of purchasing prices in 2022. Manufacturing costs increased starting with the second quarter of 2023 and has carried through into Q1/2024.\n\nChanges in commodity prices accounted for a positive low three-digit million euro impact in EBIT, while currency effects remained neutral. For the full year 2024, the BMW Group anticipates a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nResale results from end-of-lease vehicles proved to be a headwind against Q1/2023 yet remained positive. Starting with the second quarter of 2023, the competitive environment has intensified due to a better availability of vehicles. This has led to a gradual softening of the global price environment in the new and used car business which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the company expects net impact of volume, product mix and price to be slightly positive against the previous year, as communicated.Additional momentum should come from the new 5 series and the better availability of the 7 series models within the first full year leading to a stronger product mix.\n\nEBIT of auto segment was also impacted by higher selling & administrative costs,\n\nlargely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn line with its strategic plans, the BMW Group is investing more in its future this year than ever before. It plans to see record levels of R&D expenses and capital expenditure: The BMW Group is consistently focusing on innovations, efficient and low-emission technologies, as well as the further electrification and digitalisation of the product range and the company.\n\nBased on the strength of its current operating performance, the BMW Group incurred R&D expenses of € 1,974 millio n (2023: € 1,554 million/+ 27.0%) in the first quarter, which were significantly higher than the previous year. Spending was mainly focused on further electrification and digitalisation of the vehicle fleet, as well as continued development of automated driving functions. Development expenditure was also directed towards upcoming models of the NEUE KLASSE as well as successor models such as the BMW X5.\n\nThe R&D ratio (according to the German Commercial Code) increased to 5.4% (2023: 4.2%). For the full-year, the BMW Group expects a ratio of over 5.0%.\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, free cash flow of automotive segment was affected by the increase in working capital due to higher inventory levels to ensure appropriate supply to sales markets with lead times acceptable to customers.\n\nCapital expenditure of € 1,323 million (excluding captialized development costs)was allocated to facilities including facilities for vehicle projects, with a focus on electrification and digitalisation (2023: € 1,328 million/-0.37%). The capex ratio stood at 3.6% (2023: 3.6%). The company expects the ratio for the full year to be over 6%.\n\nIn Q1 2024, total investments of €2.3bn were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, segment Automotive generated € 1,283 million (2023: € 1,981 million/-35.2%) in free cash flow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment above € 6 billion, despite peak investments in R&D and CAPEX in 2024.\n\n“A long-term strategic approach, coupled with maximum flexibility in our day-to-day business and a clear focus on profitability – that is what defines the BMW Group's strong operating performance. With this strength, we are in a good position for our company's far-reaching transition with a diverse range of electrified and digitalized products. This year, it will be more important than ever to maintain our strategic course. The investments needed in the digital and electric future of our company are the highest they have ever been,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance. “We are confident about the future – because we are building on our highly attractive products and brands and on our financial strength.”\n\nFinancial services see strong growth in new business\n\nThe financing and leasing business of BMW Group Financial Services continued to experience dynamic development in the first quarter of 2024. New retail business with end customers saw strong growth: The number of new contracts climbed by 21.5% to reach a total of 422,056 (2023: 347,298 contracts).\n\nThe corresponding total volume of new business from financing and leasing contracts with retail customers was € 15,620 million (2023: € 12,788 million/+22.1%). The percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 41.8% at the end of the first quarter (2023: 36.5%/+5.3 percentage points).\n\nIn the three-month period, the segment reported pre-tax earnings of € 730 m illion(2023: € 945 million/-22.8%). Higher risk provisioning and lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles had a dampening effect on earnings against the previous year. As anticipated, prices in the used car markets continued to decline. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio remained at the low rate of 0.21% across the entire loan portfolio (2023: 0.13%). BMW Group Financial Services has made adequate risk provisions.\n\nBMW motorcycles with strong season start\n\nIn the first quarter, BMW Motorrad delivered 46,434 motorcycles and scooters to customers. Overall, BMW Motorrad expects demand for its young product line-up to remain robust this year. The new models, especially the F 800 GS, the F 900 GS and the R 1300 GS, are enjoying strong demand since their market launch, further bolstering the segment's growth strategy. The EBIT margin of 12.2%(2023: 16.5%) exceeded the guided full-year target range of 8-10%.\n\nBMW Group confirms guidance\n\nForecasts predict a slight increase of 3.2% in global economic growth for 2024. If the current economic recovery in many markets continues, growth could potentially be stronger. However, escalation of existing conflicts, with a possible increase in geopolitical tensions, could have a negative impact.\n\nThe BMW Group expects to participate in this growth, leveraging its balanced positioning across the world’s major regions.\n\nGiven the continuing demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group confirms its guidance for the year. The company expects to see slight growth in customer deliveries worldwide in 2024.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are forecast to decrease slightly, due to higher manufacturing and fixed costs, particularly personnel costs and R&D expenses, compared to the previous year. The projected decrease in used car prices is also anticipated to contribute to this development.\n\nThe BMW Group expects an EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment of between 8-10% for the full year.\n\nFor the Motorcycles Segment, a slight increase in deliveries is forecast and an EBIT margin within the target range of 8-10%.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE) in the Financial Services Segment is projected to be between 14 and 17%.\n\nThese targets will be achieved with slightly higher employee numbers.\n\nThis guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate substantially. Given the many uncertainties surrounding the existing risks and opportunities, the BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from current expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: IN Q1 2024\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEmployees (as of 31 Dec. 2023)\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1 Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues.\n\n3 Common/preferred shares.

In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result.

This has led to a gradual softening of the global price environment in the new and used car business which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the company expects net impact of volume, product mix and price to be slightly positive against the previous year, as communicated.Additional momentum should come from the new 5 series and the better availability of the 7 series models within the first full year leading to a stronger product mix.\n\nEBIT of auto segment was also impacted by higher selling & administrative costs,\n\nlargely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn line with its strategic plans, the BMW Group is investing more in its future this year than ever before. It plans to see record levels of R&D expenses and capital expenditure: The BMW Group is consistently focusing on innovations, efficient and low-emission technologies, as well as the further electrification and digitalisation of the product range and the company.\n\nBased on the strength of its current operating performance, the BMW Group incurred R&D expenses of € 1,974 millio n (2023: € 1,554 million/+ 27.0%) in the first quarter, which were significantly higher than the previous year. Spending was mainly focused on further electrification and digitalisation of the vehicle fleet, as well as continued development of automated driving functions. Development expenditure was also directed towards upcoming models of the NEUE KLASSE as well as successor models such as the BMW X5.\n\nThe R&D ratio (according to the German Commercial Code) increased to 5.4% (2023: 4.2%). For the full-year, the BMW Group expects a ratio of over 5.0%.\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, free cash flow of automotive segment was affected by the increase in working capital due to higher inventory levels to ensure appropriate supply to sales markets with lead times acceptable to customers.\n\nCapital expenditure of € 1,323 million (excluding captialized development costs)was allocated to facilities including facilities for vehicle projects, with a focus on electrification and digitalisation (2023: € 1,328 million/-0.37%). The capex ratio stood at 3.6% (2023: 3.6%). The company expects the ratio for the full year to be over 6%.\n\nIn Q1 2024, total investments of €2.3bn were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, segment Automotive generated € 1,283 million (2023: € 1,981 million/-35.2%) in free cash flow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment above € 6 billion, despite peak investments in R&D and CAPEX in 2024.\n\n“A long-term strategic approach, coupled with maximum flexibility in our day-to-day business and a clear focus on profitability – that is what defines the BMW Group's strong operating performance. With this strength, we are in a good position for our company's far-reaching transition with a diverse range of electrified and digitalized products. This year, it will be more important than ever to maintain our strategic course. The investments needed in the digital and electric future of our company are the highest they have ever been,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance. “We are confident about the future – because we are building on our highly attractive products and brands and on our financial strength.”\n\nFinancial services see strong growth in new business\n\nThe financing and leasing business of BMW Group Financial Services continued to experience dynamic development in the first quarter of 2024. New retail business with end customers saw strong growth: The number of new contracts climbed by 21.5% to reach a total of 422,056 (2023: 347,298 contracts).\n\nThe corresponding total volume of new business from financing and leasing contracts with retail customers was € 15,620 million (2023: € 12,788 million/+22.1%). The percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 41.8% at the end of the first quarter (2023: 36.5%/+5.3 percentage points).\n\nIn the three-month period, the segment reported pre-tax earnings of € 730 m illion(2023: € 945 million/-22.8%). Higher risk provisioning and lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles had a dampening effect on earnings against the previous year. As anticipated, prices in the used car markets continued to decline. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio remained at the low rate of 0.21% across the entire loan portfolio (2023: 0.13%). BMW Group Financial Services has made adequate risk provisions.\n\nBMW motorcycles with strong season start\n\nIn the first quarter, BMW Motorrad delivered 46,434 motorcycles and scooters to customers. Overall, BMW Motorrad expects demand for its young product line-up to remain robust this year. The new models, especially the F 800 GS, the F 900 GS and the R 1300 GS, are enjoying strong demand since their market launch, further bolstering the segment's growth strategy. The EBIT margin of 12.2%(2023: 16.5%) exceeded the guided full-year target range of 8-10%.\n\nBMW Group confirms guidance\n\nForecasts predict a slight increase of 3.2% in global economic growth for 2024. If the current economic recovery in many markets continues, growth could potentially be stronger. However, escalation of existing conflicts, with a possible increase in geopolitical tensions, could have a negative impact.\n\nThe BMW Group expects to participate in this growth, leveraging its balanced positioning across the world’s major regions.\n\nGiven the continuing demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group confirms its guidance for the year. The company expects to see slight growth in customer deliveries worldwide in 2024.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are forecast to decrease slightly, due to higher manufacturing and fixed costs, particularly personnel costs and R&D expenses, compared to the previous year. The projected decrease in used car prices is also anticipated to contribute to this development.\n\nThe BMW Group expects an EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment of between 8-10% for the full year.\n\nFor the Motorcycles Segment, a slight increase in deliveries is forecast and an EBIT margin within the target range of 8-10%.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE) in the Financial Services Segment is projected to be between 14 and 17%.\n\nThese targets will be achieved with slightly higher employee numbers.\n\nThis guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate substantially. Given the many uncertainties surrounding the existing risks and opportunities, the BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from current expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: IN Q1 2024\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEmployees (as of 31 Dec. 2023)\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1 Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues.\n\n3 Common/preferred shares.

In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers.

Extract and categorize the key topics and themes from the content."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Extract and list the key topics and categories for the following BMW news article.\n\n+++ Consistent strategic implementation: Dynamic BEV ramp-up aligned with profitability, as planned +++ BEV ramp-up continued as planned: 28% growth to around 83,000 BEVs in Q1 +++ BMW brand sales increased by 2.5% +++ Deliveries of models in the upper price segment rise by over 20% +++ Group EBT margin above target of >10% in Q1 +++ EBIT margin within the target range of 8-10% for nine consecutive quarters +++ Outlook for 2024 confirmed +++Munich. The BMW Group continues its successful course in 2024: parallel to its dynamic BEV ramp-up, the company achieved its margin targets. In the first three months of the year, the company delivered around 83,000 all-electric vehicles from its BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands and increased BEV sales by around 28 percent. The BMW brand overall increased its sales by 2.5%. At the same time, the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment of 8.8 percent was within the target range of 8-10 percent, according to the full-year guidance. At 11.4 percent, the EBT margin at Group level was above the strategic target of >10 percent.\n\nAfter the challenges of the corona pandemic and semiconductor availability, the company has consistently delivered quarter by quarter within its 8-10% strategic EBIT corridor since Q1 2022. This has been achieved in parallel to its rapid ramp-up of electric mobility: Over the past two years, the BMW Group delivered more than 1.1 million electrified vehicles to customers. More than 60 percent of these were purely electric BEV models. The BEV share continues to rise steadily, as planned.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the EBIT margin of Automotive segment was 12.1%. The EBIT of previous year’s first quarter benefited from the lower purchase price level of 2022, as inventories with lower manufacturing costs were sold. The inflation-related increase in manufacturing costs impacted the profit & loss statement of BMW AG after the second quarter of 2023. The higher cost level has carried through into Q1/2024.\n\n“The past nine quarters underline BMW’s continuity and reliability: As planned, we are dynamically expanding the share of electric vehicles while maintaining our high level of profitability. Some call this transformation — for us, it is continuous progress,” said the Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Oliver Zipse, on Wednesday. “We will remain on this course: We offer our customers the latest innovations and the latest technology — across all vehicle drivetrains. As a result, we continue to generate strong demand with strong products.”\n\nAutomotive markets on upward trend – BMW Group deliveries increase\n\nWith a total of 594,533 automobiles delivered to customers in the first three months, the company posted a slight growth of 1.1% compared to the previous year and reaffirmed its leading position in the global premium segment.\n\nThroughout the three-month period, the major automotive markets largely showed an upward trend based on catch-up purchases and increased sales in the mid-price volume segment. The BMW Group benefited with its young and highly attractive product line-up: The BMW brand sold 530,933 units in the first quarter – an increase of +2.5% year-on-year. It achieved sales growth of 2.4% (84,475 units) in the USA and significant growth of 10.2% in Europe with 188,863 units delivered. In China, the volume segment developed dynamically in lower price ranges, while the premium segment declined slightly. The BMW brand sold 182,998 vehicles, in line with segment development (2023: 190,774 units/-4.1%). In Germany, deliveries grew by 4.6% to 49,509 premium vehicles.\n\nThe popular BMW i4*, as well as the BMW iX1* and BMW i7*, were among the biggest growth drivers of the 78,682 BMW BEVs delivered. The BMW brand’s fully-electric vehicles saw particularly strong growth of +40.6%. A total of 122,582 BMW Group electrified vehicles, BEVs and PHEVs, were delivered to customers, which represents a sales share of almost 21%.\n\nFurther sales momentum is expected over the course of the year from the BMW iX2* and BMW i5*, which are currently ramping up.\n\nFully-electric models increased to 13.9% of total sales (2023: 11.0%). Once again, the models of upper price segments also proved to be important growth drivers – with deliveries up 21.6%.\n\nThe MINI brand is undergoing a comprehensive model changeover. For the first time, the new MINI Countryman*, was recently launched with a pure-electric drive train alongside the familiar internal combustion engine. This will be followed by the new MINI Cooper*, which comes in mid Q2 with a combustion engine or as a fully-electric vehicle. The all electric MINI Aceman* recently celebrated its world premiere at the Beijing Motor Show and is the brand’s first cross-over model for the premium small car segment. These new models are expected to deliver additional momentum from 2nd half of 2024. MINI delivered 62,075 vehicles to customers in Q1 (2023: 68,541 units/-9.4%).\n\nThe Rolls-Royce brand made an impressive e-mobility debut with the Rolls-Royce Spectre*: In the first quarter of 2024 alone, the Rolls-Royce luxury brand handed over 579 fully-electric super coupés to their new owners; 38% of the total 1,525 cars delivered were electrified (2023: 1,640 automotive/-7.0%).\n\nCurrency-adjusted Group revenues increased slightly\n\nFirst-quarter Group revenues totalled € 36,614 millionand were, therefore, on par with the previous year’s record high (2023: € 36,853 million/-0.6%). Group revenues were buoyed by higher sales volumes and a more favourable product mix.\n\nGroup EBT margin outperforms target of >10%\n\nBetween January and March, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 4,162 mi llion(2023: € 5,129 million/-18.9%). The EBT includes a financial result of € 108 million (2023: € -246 million), which reflects the market development in interest rate and currency hedging transactions. The EBT margin for this period was 11.4% (2023: 13.9%) and was above the >10% full year target. Group net profit for the first quarter totalled € 2,951 million (2023: € 3,662 million/-19.4%).\n\nBMW AG continues its share buyback programme\n\nWith the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 11 May 2022, the company initiated the purchase of shares. Shares purchased in programme one have already been cancelled. As of 31 March 2024, BMW AG holds 8,004,314 treasury shares, with a nominal value of € 8,004,314. Based on this authorisation, BMW AG purchased shares equivalent to 5.03% of the share capital as of March 31, 2024.\n\n8.8% Automotive Segment EBIT margin within full-year target range\n\nThe Automotive Segment earned revenues of € 30,939 million in the first quarter (2023: € 31,268 million/-1.1%). Excluding currency translation headwinds, especially from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar, revenues posted year-on-year growth of +1.5%. Higher sales volumes and more favourable product mix effects from the upper price segment and BEV bolstered segment revenues, underscoring the robust operating performance of the core business. Prices across the product range are expected in 2024 to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nThe Ea rnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 2,710 million for the first quarter (2023: € 3,777 million/-28.2%). The auto EBIT margin came in at 8.8% (2023: 12.1%) and was thus within the full-year target range of 8-10%. EBIT was impacted by higher manufacturing costs. As mentioned before, Q1 2023 had still benefited from the lower level of purchasing prices in 2022. Manufacturing costs increased starting with the second quarter of 2023 and has carried through into Q1/2024.\n\nChanges in commodity prices accounted for a positive low three-digit million euro impact in EBIT, while currency effects remained neutral. For the full year 2024, the BMW Group anticipates a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nResale results from end-of-lease vehicles proved to be a headwind against Q1/2023 yet remained positive. Starting with the second quarter of 2023, the competitive environment has intensified due to a better availability of vehicles. This has led to a gradual softening of the global price environment in the new and used car business which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the company expects net impact of volume, product mix and price to be slightly positive against the previous year, as communicated.Additional momentum should come from the new 5 series and the better availability of the 7 series models within the first full year leading to a stronger product mix.\n\nEBIT of auto segment was also impacted by higher selling & administrative costs,\n\nlargely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn line with its strategic plans, the BMW Group is investing more in its future this year than ever before. It plans to see record levels of R&D expenses and capital expenditure: The BMW Group is consistently focusing on innovations, efficient and low-emission technologies, as well as the further electrification and digitalisation of the product range and the company.\n\nBased on the strength of its current operating performance, the BMW Group incurred R&D expenses of € 1,974 millio n (2023: € 1,554 million/+ 27.0%) in the first quarter, which were significantly higher than the previous year. Spending was mainly focused on further electrification and digitalisation of the vehicle fleet, as well as continued development of automated driving functions. Development expenditure was also directed towards upcoming models of the NEUE KLASSE as well as successor models such as the BMW X5.\n\nThe R&D ratio (according to the German Commercial Code) increased to 5.4% (2023: 4.2%). For the full-year, the BMW Group expects a ratio of over 5.0%.\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, free cash flow of automotive segment was affected by the increase in working capital due to higher inventory levels to ensure appropriate supply to sales markets with lead times acceptable to customers.\n\nCapital expenditure of € 1,323 million (excluding captialized development costs)was allocated to facilities including facilities for vehicle projects, with a focus on electrification and digitalisation (2023: € 1,328 million/-0.37%). The capex ratio stood at 3.6% (2023: 3.6%). The company expects the ratio for the full year to be over 6%.\n\nIn Q1 2024, total investments of €2.3bn were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, segment Automotive generated € 1,283 million (2023: € 1,981 million/-35.2%) in free cash flow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment above € 6 billion, despite peak investments in R&D and CAPEX in 2024.\n\n“A long-term strategic approach, coupled with maximum flexibility in our day-to-day business and a clear focus on profitability – that is what defines the BMW Group's strong operating performance. With this strength, we are in a good position for our company's far-reaching transition with a diverse range of electrified and digitalized products. This year, it will be more important than ever to maintain our strategic course. The investments needed in the digital and electric future of our company are the highest they have ever been,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance. “We are confident about the future – because we are building on our highly attractive products and brands and on our financial strength.”\n\nFinancial services see strong growth in new business\n\nThe financing and leasing business of BMW Group Financial Services continued to experience dynamic development in the first quarter of 2024. New retail business with end customers saw strong growth: The number of new contracts climbed by 21.5% to reach a total of 422,056 (2023: 347,298 contracts).\n\nThe corresponding total volume of new business from financing and leasing contracts with retail customers was € 15,620 million (2023: € 12,788 million/+22.1%). The percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 41.8% at the end of the first quarter (2023: 36.5%/+5.3 percentage points).\n\nIn the three-month period, the segment reported pre-tax earnings of € 730 m illion(2023: € 945 million/-22.8%). Higher risk provisioning and lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles had a dampening effect on earnings against the previous year. As anticipated, prices in the used car markets continued to decline. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio remained at the low rate of 0.21% across the entire loan portfolio (2023: 0.13%). BMW Group Financial Services has made adequate risk provisions.\n\nBMW motorcycles with strong season start\n\nIn the first quarter, BMW Motorrad delivered 46,434 motorcycles and scooters to customers. Overall, BMW Motorrad expects demand for its young product line-up to remain robust this year. The new models, especially the F 800 GS, the F 900 GS and the R 1300 GS, are enjoying strong demand since their market launch, further bolstering the segment's growth strategy. The EBIT margin of 12.2%(2023: 16.5%) exceeded the guided full-year target range of 8-10%.\n\nBMW Group confirms guidance\n\nForecasts predict a slight increase of 3.2% in global economic growth for 2024. If the current economic recovery in many markets continues, growth could potentially be stronger. However, escalation of existing conflicts, with a possible increase in geopolitical tensions, could have a negative impact.\n\nThe BMW Group expects to participate in this growth, leveraging its balanced positioning across the world’s major regions.\n\nGiven the continuing demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group confirms its guidance for the year.

Identify the article type based on its content and structure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Identify the type of the following BMW news article.\n\n+++ Consistent strategic implementation: Dynamic BEV ramp-up aligned with profitability, as planned +++ BEV ramp-up continued as planned: 28% growth to around 83,000 BEVs in Q1 +++ BMW brand sales increased by 2.5% +++ Deliveries of models in the upper price segment rise by over 20% +++ Group EBT margin above target of >10% in Q1 +++ EBIT margin within the target range of 8-10% for nine consecutive quarters +++ Outlook for 2024 confirmed +++Munich. The BMW Group continues its successful course in 2024: parallel to its dynamic BEV ramp-up, the company achieved its margin targets. In the first three months of the year, the company delivered around 83,000 all-electric vehicles from its BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands and increased BEV sales by around 28 percent. The BMW brand overall increased its sales by 2.5%. At the same time, the EBIT margin in the Automotive segment of 8.8 percent was within the target range of 8-10 percent, according to the full-year guidance. At 11.4 percent, the EBT margin at Group level was above the strategic target of >10 percent.\n\nAfter the challenges of the corona pandemic and semiconductor availability, the company has consistently delivered quarter by quarter within its 8-10% strategic EBIT corridor since Q1 2022. This has been achieved in parallel to its rapid ramp-up of electric mobility: Over the past two years, the BMW Group delivered more than 1.1 million electrified vehicles to customers. More than 60 percent of these were purely electric BEV models. The BEV share continues to rise steadily, as planned.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the EBIT margin of Automotive segment was 12.1%. The EBIT of previous year’s first quarter benefited from the lower purchase price level of 2022, as inventories with lower manufacturing costs were sold. The inflation-related increase in manufacturing costs impacted the profit & loss statement of BMW AG after the second quarter of 2023. The higher cost level has carried through into Q1/2024.\n\n“The past nine quarters underline BMW’s continuity and reliability: As planned, we are dynamically expanding the share of electric vehicles while maintaining our high level of profitability. Some call this transformation — for us, it is continuous progress,” said the Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Oliver Zipse, on Wednesday. “We will remain on this course: We offer our customers the latest innovations and the latest technology — across all vehicle drivetrains. As a result, we continue to generate strong demand with strong products.”\n\nAutomotive markets on upward trend – BMW Group deliveries increase\n\nWith a total of 594,533 automobiles delivered to customers in the first three months, the company posted a slight growth of 1.1% compared to the previous year and reaffirmed its leading position in the global premium segment.\n\nThroughout the three-month period, the major automotive markets largely showed an upward trend based on catch-up purchases and increased sales in the mid-price volume segment. The BMW Group benefited with its young and highly attractive product line-up: The BMW brand sold 530,933 units in the first quarter – an increase of +2.5% year-on-year. It achieved sales growth of 2.4% (84,475 units) in the USA and significant growth of 10.2% in Europe with 188,863 units delivered. In China, the volume segment developed dynamically in lower price ranges, while the premium segment declined slightly. The BMW brand sold 182,998 vehicles, in line with segment development (2023: 190,774 units/-4.1%). In Germany, deliveries grew by 4.6% to 49,509 premium vehicles.\n\nThe popular BMW i4*, as well as the BMW iX1* and BMW i7*, were among the biggest growth drivers of the 78,682 BMW BEVs delivered. The BMW brand’s fully-electric vehicles saw particularly strong growth of +40.6%. A total of 122,582 BMW Group electrified vehicles, BEVs and PHEVs, were delivered to customers, which represents a sales share of almost 21%.\n\nFurther sales momentum is expected over the course of the year from the BMW iX2* and BMW i5*, which are currently ramping up.\n\nFully-electric models increased to 13.9% of total sales (2023: 11.0%). Once again, the models of upper price segments also proved to be important growth drivers – with deliveries up 21.6%.\n\nThe MINI brand is undergoing a comprehensive model changeover. For the first time, the new MINI Countryman*, was recently launched with a pure-electric drive train alongside the familiar internal combustion engine. This will be followed by the new MINI Cooper*, which comes in mid Q2 with a combustion engine or as a fully-electric vehicle. The all electric MINI Aceman* recently celebrated its world premiere at the Beijing Motor Show and is the brand’s first cross-over model for the premium small car segment. These new models are expected to deliver additional momentum from 2nd half of 2024. MINI delivered 62,075 vehicles to customers in Q1 (2023: 68,541 units/-9.4%).\n\nThe Rolls-Royce brand made an impressive e-mobility debut with the Rolls-Royce Spectre*: In the first quarter of 2024 alone, the Rolls-Royce luxury brand handed over 579 fully-electric super coupés to their new owners; 38% of the total 1,525 cars delivered were electrified (2023: 1,640 automotive/-7.0%).\n\nCurrency-adjusted Group revenues increased slightly\n\nFirst-quarter Group revenues totalled € 36,614 millionand were, therefore, on par with the previous year’s record high (2023: € 36,853 million/-0.6%). Group revenues were buoyed by higher sales volumes and a more favourable product mix.\n\nGroup EBT margin outperforms target of >10%\n\nBetween January and March, the BMW Group reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 4,162 mi llion(2023: € 5,129 million/-18.9%). The EBT includes a financial result of € 108 million (2023: € -246 million), which reflects the market development in interest rate and currency hedging transactions. The EBT margin for this period was 11.4% (2023: 13.9%) and was above the >10% full year target. Group net profit for the first quarter totalled € 2,951 million (2023: € 3,662 million/-19.4%).\n\nBMW AG continues its share buyback programme\n\nWith the authorisation of the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 11 May 2022, the company initiated the purchase of shares. Shares purchased in programme one have already been cancelled. As of 31 March 2024, BMW AG holds 8,004,314 treasury shares, with a nominal value of € 8,004,314. Based on this authorisation, BMW AG purchased shares equivalent to 5.03% of the share capital as of March 31, 2024.\n\n8.8% Automotive Segment EBIT margin within full-year target range\n\nThe Automotive Segment earned revenues of € 30,939 million in the first quarter (2023: € 31,268 million/-1.1%). Excluding currency translation headwinds, especially from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar, revenues posted year-on-year growth of +1.5%. Higher sales volumes and more favourable product mix effects from the upper price segment and BEV bolstered segment revenues, underscoring the robust operating performance of the core business. Prices across the product range are expected in 2024 to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nThe Ea rnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 2,710 million for the first quarter (2023: € 3,777 million/-28.2%). The auto EBIT margin came in at 8.8% (2023: 12.1%) and was thus within the full-year target range of 8-10%. EBIT was impacted by higher manufacturing costs. As mentioned before, Q1 2023 had still benefited from the lower level of purchasing prices in 2022. Manufacturing costs increased starting with the second quarter of 2023 and has carried through into Q1/2024.\n\nChanges in commodity prices accounted for a positive low three-digit million euro impact in EBIT, while currency effects remained neutral. For the full year 2024, the BMW Group anticipates a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nResale results from end-of-lease vehicles proved to be a headwind against Q1/2023 yet remained positive. Starting with the second quarter of 2023, the competitive environment has intensified due to a better availability of vehicles. This has led to a gradual softening of the global price environment in the new and used car business which has continued into the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor the full year 2024, the company expects net impact of volume, product mix and price to be slightly positive against the previous year, as communicated.Additional momentum should come from the new 5 series and the better availability of the 7 series models within the first full year leading to a stronger product mix.\n\nEBIT of auto segment was also impacted by higher selling & administrative costs,\n\nlargely due to IT projects and the increase in personnel costs, which was implemented from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn line with its strategic plans, the BMW Group is investing more in its future this year than ever before. It plans to see record levels of R&D expenses and capital expenditure: The BMW Group is consistently focusing on innovations, efficient and low-emission technologies, as well as the further electrification and digitalisation of the product range and the company.\n\nBased on the strength of its current operating performance, the BMW Group incurred R&D expenses of € 1,974 millio n (2023: € 1,554 million/+ 27.0%) in the first quarter, which were significantly higher than the previous year. Spending was mainly focused on further electrification and digitalisation of the vehicle fleet, as well as continued development of automated driving functions. Development expenditure was also directed towards upcoming models of the NEUE KLASSE as well as successor models such as the BMW X5.\n\nThe R&D ratio (according to the German Commercial Code) increased to 5.4% (2023: 4.2%). For the full-year, the BMW Group expects a ratio of over 5.0%.\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, free cash flow of automotive segment was affected by the increase in working capital due to higher inventory levels to ensure appropriate supply to sales markets with lead times acceptable to customers.\n\nCapital expenditure of € 1,323 million (excluding captialized development costs)was allocated to facilities including facilities for vehicle projects, with a focus on electrification and digitalisation (2023: € 1,328 million/-0.37%). The capex ratio stood at 3.6% (2023: 3.6%). The company expects the ratio for the full year to be over 6%.\n\nIn Q1 2024, total investments of €2.3bn were made into future models and innovations. Nevertheless, segment Automotive generated € 1,283 million (2023: € 1,981 million/-35.2%) in free cash flow.\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group is targeting a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment above € 6 billion, despite peak investments in R&D and CAPEX in 2024.\n\n“A long-term strategic approach, coupled with maximum flexibility in our day-to-day business and a clear focus on profitability – that is what defines the BMW Group's strong operating performance. With this strength, we are in a good position for our company's far-reaching transition with a diverse range of electrified and digitalized products. This year, it will be more important than ever to maintain our strategic course. The investments needed in the digital and electric future of our company are the highest they have ever been,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance. “We are confident about the future – because we are building on our highly attractive products and brands and on our financial strength.”\n\nFinancial services see strong growth in new business\n\nThe financing and leasing business of BMW Group Financial Services continued to experience dynamic development in the first quarter of 2024. New retail business with end customers saw strong growth: The number of new contracts climbed by 21.5% to reach a total of 422,056 (2023: 347,298 contracts).\n\nThe corresponding total volume of new business from financing and leasing contracts with retail customers was € 15,620 million (2023: € 12,788 million/+22.1%). The percentage of BMW Group new vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services Segment reached 41.8% at the end of the first quarter (2023: 36.5%/+5.3 percentage points).\n\nIn the three-month period, the segment reported pre-tax earnings of € 730 m illion(2023: € 945 million/-22.8%). Higher risk provisioning and lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles had a dampening effect on earnings against the previous year. As anticipated, prices in the used car markets continued to decline. During the reporting period, the credit loss ratio remained at the low rate of 0.21% across the entire loan portfolio (2023: 0.13%). BMW Group Financial Services has made adequate risk provisions.\n\nBMW motorcycles with strong season start\n\nIn the first quarter, BMW Motorrad delivered 46,434 motorcycles and scooters to customers. Overall, BMW Motorrad expects demand for its young product line-up to remain robust this year. The new models, especially the F 800 GS, the F 900 GS and the R 1300 GS, are enjoying strong demand since their market launch, further bolstering the segment's growth strategy. The EBIT margin of 12.2%(2023: 16.5%) exceeded the guided full-year target range of 8-10%.\n\nBMW Group confirms guidance\n\nForecasts predict a slight increase of 3.2% in global economic growth for 2024. If the current economic recovery in many markets continues, growth could potentially be stronger. However, escalation of existing conflicts, with a possible increase in geopolitical tensions, could have a negative impact.\n\nThe BMW Group expects to participate in this growth, leveraging its balanced positioning across the world’s major regions.\n\nGiven the continuing demand for its attractive premium vehicles, the BMW Group confirms its guidance for the year. The company expects to see slight growth in customer deliveries worldwide in 2024.\n\nGroup earnings before tax are forecast to decrease slightly, due to higher manufacturing and fixed costs, particularly personnel costs and R&D expenses, compared to the previous year. The projected decrease in used car prices is also anticipated to contribute to this development.\n\nThe BMW Group expects an EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment of between 8-10% for the full year.\n\nFor the Motorcycles Segment, a slight increase in deliveries is forecast and an EBIT margin within the target range of 8-10%.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE) in the Financial Services Segment is projected to be between 14 and 17%.\n\nThese targets will be achieved with slightly higher employee numbers.\n\nThis guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate substantially. Given the many uncertainties surrounding the existing risks and opportunities, the BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from current expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group – an overview: IN Q1 2024\n\nDeliveries to customers\n\nEmployees (as of 31 Dec. 2023)\n\nEBIT margin Automotive Segment\n\nEBIT margin Motorcycles Segment\n\nEBT margin BMW Group2\n\nProfit before financial result (EBIT)\n\nProfit before tax (EBT)\n\nEarnings per share of common stock\n\nEarnings per share of preferred stock3\n\n1 Deliveries include the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang\n\n2 Ratio of Group earnings before taxes to Group revenues.\n\n3 Common/preferred shares. Earnings per share of preferred stock are calculated by distributing the earnings required to cover the additional dividend of € 0.02 per preferred share proportionally over the quarters of the corresponding financial year.\n\nGLOSSARY – explanatory comments on key performance indicators\n\nDeliveries to customers A new or used vehicle is recorded as a delivery once it is handed over to the end user (which also includes leaseholders under lease contracts with BMW Financial Services). In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result.

As of 31 December 2023, the BMW Group had a workforce of 154,950 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action.

Charles Weerts (BEL) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) have won the drivers’ title in the Sprint Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe. At the Valencia (ESP) season finale, the Team WRT duo in the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO triumphed on Sunday and, after a real nail-biting showdown, claimed the Sprint crown. Team WRT also defended the team title in the Sprint Cup.\n\nWeerts and van der Linde had gone into the last of the five Sprint weekends of the GT World Challenge Europe with a 1.5-point lead. However, in Saturday’s race the #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO was hit by a competitor right at the start and had to retire shortly afterwards. That closed the standings even further, with four teams entering the decisive race within just 4.5 points of each other.\n\nOn Sunday, the Belgian-South African duo struck back impressively when van der Linde secured fourth place on the grid in qualifying. With an outstanding stint, the South African fought his way past the competition and handed over the car in the lead to Weerts at the pit stop. Despite intense pressure from behind, the Belgian kept his cool, brought home the second win of the season after a true thriller, and sealed the overall Sprint Cup title.\n\nTeam WRT also successfully defended the team title in the Sprint Cup. For Weerts, it was already his fourth Sprint Cup title in GT World Challenge Europe after 2020, 2021 and 2022. For van der Linde, it marked his first overall victory in GT World Challenge Europe.\n\nTheir teammates Gilles Stadsbader and Matisse Lismont (both BEL) also had reason to celebrate. On Saturday, they triumphed in the Silver Class with the #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, and on Sunday they added a third place in class to secure a double podium finish at Circuit Ricardo Tormo. Maxime Oosten and Mex Jansen (both NED) from Team Paradine Competition also enjoyed two Silver Class podiums: third on Saturday followed by second on Sunday.

Congratulations to Charles Weerts, Kelvin van der Linde and Team WRT on winning the overall Sprint Cup title. After a difficult Saturday, our drivers kept their nerve in a real thriller on Sunday and delivered a fantastic race. I am very happy that they earned the well-deserved reward for a strong season. I’m also delighted about the #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO victory in the Silver Class on Saturday and the additional podiums by Team WRT and Paradine Competition, who also delivered an impressive weekend. Many thanks to everyone involved.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal WRT): “This weekend was an incredible rollercoaster. From the frustration after qualifying and Saturday’s race to the comeback and triumph on Sunday – it just feels fantastic. It was an outstanding team effort. Once again, the team in the pit lane showed how good they are, securing the fastest pit stop overall, and on top of that winning the Pit Stop Challenge championship, is just brilliant. This is our first title with BMW, and we are very proud of it. A huge thank you to everyone! This trophy is well-deserved by the entire team. Now the focus shifts to the FIA WEC race at Fuji!”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Sprint Cup Champion 2025): “Overall it was quite a difficult weekend for us. Saturday in particular was tough. We struggled in qualifying, and then had a pretty big hit in the very first lap. I had quite a bit of pain all day and night, which meant I couldn’t recover properly. But Kelvin put in an outstanding qualifying today and his race left me speechless – it was unbelievable. The whole team once again did a fantastic job in the pit stop. After that, I just tried to bring the car home. It was tough going beyond the pain, but of course you do it for a championship. We deserved this, we made no mistakes. Thanks to the team, BMW M Motorsport and Kelvin for this incredible season.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Sprint Cup Champion 2025): “It was a very dramatic final weekend, almost as expected, with a brutal low on Saturday and an incredible high on Sunday. Charles and I grew a lot as a team this year. At the beginning of the season, he helped me a lot in getting used to the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and was very open in helping me to be fast. I am very grateful for that, and it really helped us achieve this result. Over the season, Team WRT won us this championship with their pit stops. Sprint races are hugely influenced by pit stops, and on the weekends when we weren’t the strongest on track, we were incredibly fast in the pits and made the difference there. So, a big thank you to the team.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Charles Weerts and Kelvin van der Linde triumph on Sunday and secure the drivers’ title in the Sprint standings +++ Team WRT once again wins the team title in the Sprint Cup +++ #30 BMW M4 GT3 EVO wins Saturday’s race in the Silver Class +++"}]}

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nDebrecen. The BMW Group has entered the final phase before the first Neue Klasse model rolls off the assembly line. Series production of the new BMW iX3 will get underway in late October at the BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary, as the newest, most innovative manufacturing facility in the company’s global production network officially begins work.\n\n“The start of series production for the BMW iX3 signals a new era of automotive manufacturing. Our new plant in Debrecen has been designed and built fully in line with our strategic vision of the iFACTORY. Digital from the very beginning, the plant will offer a new dimension in efficient production without fossil fuels,” says Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production.\n\nThe BMW iFACTORY represents a strategic vision of production, built on streamlined, efficient structures, responsible resource management, economical use of cutting-edge digital innovations and a strong focus on employees. The BMW Group has also registered new patents for a large number of innovative systems and processes at Plant Debrecen.\n\n“We have taken on the challenge of building a completely new vehicle as the first job at an entirely new plant – and doing so in the leanest, most efficient way possible. We have simplified processes, reduced complexity, digitally validated each individual operation and systematically leveraged expertise across our global network. The result is this plant, with its efficient production, innovative processes and the flexibility to integrate additional models,” says Hans-Peter Kemser, head of BMW Group Plant Debrecen.\n\nAs with any new model, capacity for the new BMW iX3 will be gradually ramped up in stages after the start of production. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, the iX3 showcases the latest design and technology innovations that will define the brand's entire model range in the future. Between now and 2027, the technologies in the Neue Klasse will be integrated into 40 new models and model updates.\n\nFrom virtual factory to reality\n\nThe guiding principles of the BMW iFACTORY have been fully implemented in the technologies employed at the new BMW Group plant in Debrecen. For example, Plant Debrecen was planned and built digitally from the outset, and celebrated its virtual start of production back in March 2023 in the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory. This approach allowed every operation to be tested virtually in advance, enabling production lines to be installed in the buildings exactly as in the digital twin.\n\nOptimal processes for all plant technologies\n\nWith an optimised value stream and efficient systems, the press shop guarantees a high level of productivity. The BMW Group continues to follow its proven strategy of using the same tools and presses throughout its global network. This optimises capacity utilisation within the network by allowing press tools to be deployed at multiple locations and enabling staff to be trained in-network.\n\nThe body shop, in particular, benefits from prior digital planning and validation. Every process detail was digitally simulated in advance to determine the ideal value stream and ensure that each of the nearly 1,000 robots was optimally positioned. From the outset, close collaboration between development and production teams led to high production efficiency and maximum customer benefit. For example, the number of joining methods was significantly reduced, lowering overall complexity. Design features integrated early in development are also evident in the details of the Neue Klasse, such as the invisible door seal. This creates a visual connection between the window and the door, resulting in a unique look. In addition, maximising the space available for the battery in the body structure – and thus the size and performance of the battery – directly benefits the customer.\n\nAt BMW Group Plant Debrecen, the paint shop plays a critical role in significantly reducing the CO2e footprint of the BMW iX3. Production of the new BMW iX3 will generate a total of about 80 kg CO₂e (scope 1/2 emissions). This figure covers CO₂e emissions from Plant Debrecen, as well as in-house parts production at other BMW Group facilities, including components manufactured in Landshut, for example. This represents a reduction of approx. two-thirds compared to production of existing BMW derivatives. For Plant Debrecen alone, this approach will reduce CO₂e emissions from the manufacture of a vehicle, including its high-voltage battery, by around 90% – to about 34 kg CO₂e (when operating at full capacity, compared with other BMW Group facilities).\n\nPaint shops typically rely on gas to reach the high temperatures (up to 180 degrees Celsius) required. Plant Debrecen will be the BMW Group's first car plant supplied exclusively with electricity from renewable energy sources during normal operation, i.e. without using fossil fuels such as oil or gas. Because of its high energy demands, the paint shop is the most important factor in significantly lowering Plant Debrecen’s CO2e emissions. In the paint shop alone, using electricity from renewable sources reduces annual CO2e emissions by up to 12,000 tonnes. About a quarter of the plant's annual power needs will be supplied by the 50‑hectare on-site photovoltaic system. Surplus solar energy, such as that generated on non‑working days, is stored in a 1,800 m³ thermal storage system with a capacity of 130 MWh.\n\nThe paint shop also uses an energy recovery system. A heat grid was successfully implemented in the design of the new paint shop, delivering additional energy savings of up to 10%. This innovative concept combines multiple measures for efficient energy recovery from the compressed air supply, drying ovens and cooling systems. The recovered waste heat is then used to preheat the water circuit.\n\nIn addition, a thermal storage system – holding 1,800 m³ of water, with a capacity of 130 MWh – stores surplus energy from the photovoltaic system during off-peak periods and supplies it as heat during peak demand.\n\nFull digitalisation of production processes further boosts assembly efficiency. The AIQX (Artificial Intelligence Quality Next) IT platform developed in-house at the BMW Group is a key component of the BMW iFACTORY. AIQX uses sensors and camera systems along the production line to automate quality processes. AI evaluates the data and provides real-time feedback to employees on the line. Looking ahead, vehicles on the line will also become active, connected participants in the industrial IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystem. They will conduct self-analysis, interact with plant employees in real time and automatically share and document relevant messages, using tools such as on-board cameras and IT systems. The equipment, tools, components and every BMW in the assembly halls are already digitally connected to the BMW production system.\n\nThe building's “finger structure” – an optimised version of the design employed at BMW Group Plant Leipzig – allows 80% of parts to be delivered directly to the correct point of assembly on the line. All-electric in-house logistics also benefit from autonomous tugger trains, which transport high-voltage batteries directly from production to installation points, as well as Smart Transport Robots that autonomously deliver smaller components to the assembly line. By linking all internal and external databases, the entire logistics process achieves unprecedented digital depth, automating many previously manual, interconnected analysis tasks. Well-structured information is therefore available at any time and can be analysed instantly “at the push of a button”.\n\nThe BMW Group has created highly intelligent production processes for its new high-voltage batteries developed in-house. Plant Debrecen will be the first of five plants worldwide to begin series production of Gen6 high-voltage batteries. The production processes were initially developed and tested at pilot plants. Artificial intelligence, data analytics and constant knowledge sharing within the production network also play a key role in the ramp-up of production. Digital twins of production and comprehensive AI databases ensure optimisation of processes and employee training. A consistent zero-defect approach enables seamless in-line quality inspections and 100% end‑of-line monitoring. In line keeping with the “local for local” principle, high‑voltage battery assembly takes place directly on site, allowing the production teams to take advantage of infrastructure efficiencies and short distances.\n\nBest of the best:Plant Debrecen benefits from expertise at all production sites worldwide\n\nBMW Group Plant Debrecen is the first production site in the company's network not tied to a specific primary plant. Instead, it serves as a network plant, combining best practices from various locations worldwide. A major advantage of this approach is that the plant’s current workforce of more than 2,000 employees can be trained within the network, allowing employee know-how from different locations, such as China, South Africa, Mexico, the US and, of course, Germany, to be shared. At the same time, employees throughout the global network gain the opportunity to share their technology insights in Debrecen and bring expertise in production of the Neue Klasse models back to their own location – creating a win-win situation for all the plants.\n\nA long version with further details on all technologies is available as a PDF file in the downloads section.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO₂-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ First BMW Group car plant to rely entirely on electricity from renewable energy during normal operation; no fossil fuels used +++ Use of electric power in paint shop drives reduction in CO₂e emissions from BMW iX3 production +++ Typical iFACTORY: virtual planning and testing, efficient processes and structures, smart use of AI +++ High-voltage batteries assembled on site +++"}]}

For example, the number of joining methods was significantly reduced, lowering overall complexity. Design features integrated early in development are also evident in the details of the Neue Klasse, such as the invisible door seal. This creates a visual connection between the window and the door, resulting in a unique look. In addition, maximising the space available for the battery in the body structure – and thus the size and performance of the battery – directly benefits the customer.\n\nAt BMW Group Plant Debrecen, the paint shop plays a critical role in significantly reducing the CO2e footprint of the BMW iX3. Production of the new BMW iX3 will generate a total of about 80 kg CO₂e (scope 1/2 emissions). This figure covers CO₂e emissions from Plant Debrecen, as well as in-house parts production at other BMW Group facilities, including components manufactured in Landshut, for example. This represents a reduction of approx. two-thirds compared to production of existing BMW derivatives. For Plant Debrecen alone, this approach will reduce CO₂e emissions from the manufacture of a vehicle, including its high-voltage battery, by around 90% – to about 34 kg CO₂e (when operating at full capacity, compared with other BMW Group facilities).\n\nPaint shops typically rely on gas to reach the high temperatures (up to 180 degrees Celsius) required. Plant Debrecen will be the BMW Group's first car plant supplied exclusively with electricity from renewable energy sources during normal operation, i.e. without using fossil fuels such as oil or gas. Because of its high energy demands, the paint shop is the most important factor in significantly lowering Plant Debrecen’s CO2e emissions. In the paint shop alone, using electricity from renewable sources reduces annual CO2e emissions by up to 12,000 tonnes. About a quarter of the plant's annual power needs will be supplied by the 50‑hectare on-site photovoltaic system. Surplus solar energy, such as that generated on non‑working days, is stored in a 1,800 m³ thermal storage system with a capacity of 130 MWh.\n\nThe paint shop also uses an energy recovery system. A heat grid was successfully implemented in the design of the new paint shop, delivering additional energy savings of up to 10%. This innovative concept combines multiple measures for efficient energy recovery from the compressed air supply, drying ovens and cooling systems. The recovered waste heat is then used to preheat the water circuit.\n\nIn addition, a thermal storage system – holding 1,800 m³ of water, with a capacity of 130 MWh – stores surplus energy from the photovoltaic system during off-peak periods and supplies it as heat during peak demand.\n\nFull digitalisation of production processes further boosts assembly efficiency. The AIQX (Artificial Intelligence Quality Next) IT platform developed in-house at the BMW Group is a key component of the BMW iFACTORY. AIQX uses sensors and camera systems along the production line to automate quality processes. AI evaluates the data and provides real-time feedback to employees on the line. Looking ahead, vehicles on the line will also become active, connected participants in the industrial IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystem. They will conduct self-analysis, interact with plant employees in real time and automatically share and document relevant messages, using tools such as on-board cameras and IT systems. The equipment, tools, components and every BMW in the assembly halls are already digitally connected to the BMW production system.\n\nThe building's “finger structure” – an optimised version of the design employed at BMW Group Plant Leipzig – allows 80% of parts to be delivered directly to the correct point of assembly on the line. All-electric in-house logistics also benefit from autonomous tugger trains, which transport high-voltage batteries directly from production to installation points, as well as Smart Transport Robots that autonomously deliver smaller components to the assembly line. By linking all internal and external databases, the entire logistics process achieves unprecedented digital depth, automating many previously manual, interconnected analysis tasks. Well-structured information is therefore available at any time and can be analysed instantly “at the push of a button”.\n\nThe BMW Group has created highly intelligent production processes for its new high-voltage batteries developed in-house. Plant Debrecen will be the first of five plants worldwide to begin series production of Gen6 high-voltage batteries. The production processes were initially developed and tested at pilot plants. Artificial intelligence, data analytics and constant knowledge sharing within the production network also play a key role in the ramp-up of production. Digital twins of production and comprehensive AI databases ensure optimisation of processes and employee training. A consistent zero-defect approach enables seamless in-line quality inspections and 100% end‑of-line monitoring. In line keeping with the “local for local” principle, high‑voltage battery assembly takes place directly on site, allowing the production teams to take advantage of infrastructure efficiencies and short distances.\n\nBest of the best:Plant Debrecen benefits from expertise at all production sites worldwide\n\nBMW Group Plant Debrecen is the first production site in the company's network not tied to a specific primary plant. Instead, it serves as a network plant, combining best practices from various locations worldwide. A major advantage of this approach is that the plant’s current workforce of more than 2,000 employees can be trained within the network, allowing employee know-how from different locations, such as China, South Africa, Mexico, the US and, of course, Germany, to be shared. At the same time, employees throughout the global network gain the opportunity to share their technology insights in Debrecen and bring expertise in production of the Neue Klasse models back to their own location – creating a win-win situation for all the plants.\n\nA long version with further details on all technologies is available as a PDF file in the downloads section.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO₂-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "iFACTORY, Neue Klasse, Technology, Logistics, Production, Recycling, Industry 4.0, Smart Logistics, Debrecen, iX3, Sustainability, Responsibility"}]}

The BMW Group has entered the final phase before the first Neue Klasse model rolls off the assembly line. Series production of the new BMW iX3 will get underway in late October at the BMW Group plant in Debrecen, Hungary, as the newest, most innovative manufacturing facility in the company’s global production network officially begins work.\n\n“The start of series production for the BMW iX3 signals a new era of automotive manufacturing. Our new plant in Debrecen has been designed and built fully in line with our strategic vision of the iFACTORY. Digital from the very beginning, the plant will offer a new dimension in efficient production without fossil fuels,” says Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production.\n\nThe BMW iFACTORY represents a strategic vision of production, built on streamlined, efficient structures, responsible resource management, economical use of cutting-edge digital innovations and a strong focus on employees. The BMW Group has also registered new patents for a large number of innovative systems and processes at Plant Debrecen.\n\n“We have taken on the challenge of building a completely new vehicle as the first job at an entirely new plant – and doing so in the leanest, most efficient way possible. We have simplified processes, reduced complexity, digitally validated each individual operation and systematically leveraged expertise across our global network. The result is this plant, with its efficient production, innovative processes and the flexibility to integrate additional models,” says Hans-Peter Kemser, head of BMW Group Plant Debrecen.\n\nAs with any new model, capacity for the new BMW iX3 will be gradually ramped up in stages after the start of production. Spearheading the arrival of the Neue Klasse, the iX3 showcases the latest design and technology innovations that will define the brand's entire model range in the future. Between now and 2027, the technologies in the Neue Klasse will be integrated into 40 new models and model updates.\n\nFrom virtual factory to reality\n\nThe guiding principles of the BMW iFACTORY have been fully implemented in the technologies employed at the new BMW Group plant in Debrecen. For example, Plant Debrecen was planned and built digitally from the outset, and celebrated its virtual start of production back in March 2023 in the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory. This approach allowed every operation to be tested virtually in advance, enabling production lines to be installed in the buildings exactly as in the digital twin.\n\nOptimal processes for all plant technologies\n\nWith an optimised value stream and efficient systems, the press shop guarantees a high level of productivity. The BMW Group continues to follow its proven strategy of using the same tools and presses throughout its global network. This optimises capacity utilisation within the network by allowing press tools to be deployed at multiple locations and enabling staff to be trained in-network.\n\nThe body shop, in particular, benefits from prior digital planning and validation. Every process detail was digitally simulated in advance to determine the ideal value stream and ensure that each of the nearly 1,000 robots was optimally positioned. From the outset, close collaboration between development and production teams led to high production efficiency and maximum customer benefit.

After missing two race weekends due to his severe crash at Magny-Cours (FRA), Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) made an impressive return. The BMW Motorrad factory rider made his comeback in the tenth round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) – both on track and on the podium. After not still being able to compete the previous week at Cremona (ITA) due to a mild pneumothorax, Razgatlioglu was back to his usual strength on his ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team BMW M 1000 RR, finishing second in all three races. That extended his lead in the championship standings, now giving him a 39-point advantage. Saturday even saw a double podium for the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family as Garrett Gerloff (USA) from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, who had another strong weekend in Spain, finished third behind Razgatlioglu.\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED / ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) and Scott Redding (GBR / Bonovo action BMW Racing Team) also collected valuable points at MotorLand Aragón.\n\nRace one on Saturday afternoon turned into a real thriller, ending with BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s first WorldSBK double podium in three years. The race was red-flagged on the first lap due to track conditions. After the restart, the nearly 28,000 fans witnessed 17 laps of action-packed racing. At the front, a group battled fiercely for the lead and podium spots. Razgatlioglu, starting from fifth, and van der Mark, coming from eleventh, were right in the mix. Van der Mark fell back mid-race, but Gerloff, after an excellent comeback, was now in the thick of things. Starting from tenth, Gerloff climbed to third by lap nine and was hunting down the leaders. In the following laps, Razgatlioglu and Gerloff swapped second place several times, putting pressure on the race leader, Andrea Iannone (ITA / Ducati). After a nail-biting finish, Razgatlioglu finished second, and Gerloff took third, both stepping onto the podium together. Van der Mark finished ninth. Redding, who was pushed off track at the start and rejoined the race in 17th, fought his way back to 11th.\n\nSunday morning’s Superpole Race was no less thrilling. This time, a three-way battle for the lead went down to the wire. Razgatlioglu moved into second in lap two and battled with the two Ducati factory riders, Nicolo Bulega (ITA) and Alvaro Bautista (ESP). After several lead changes, the race was decided in the final moments, with Razgatlioglu securing second place for his second podium since his comeback. Gerloff aimed to improve his grid position for race two, which he successfully did by finishing fifth. Van der Mark impressed with another comeback, recovering from 18th at the start to finish eighth. Like Razgatlioglu and Gerloff, he also improved his starting position. Redding ensured all four BMW M 1000 RRs finished in the top ten, missing out on ninth by just two-tenths of a second to finish tenth.\n\nIn Sunday afternoon’s second main race, Bautista and Razgatlioglu sprinted away from the field. The pair broke multiple lap records while fighting for the win, with Razgatlioglu sticking closely to Bautista’s rear, waiting for his chance. However, in the closing stages, Razgatlioglu had to drop back slightly but still finished second for the third time during his comeback weekend. Gerloff was again in the fight for the podium and finished fifth. Van der Mark raced with the lead group early on and crossed the finish line in seventh after 18 laps. Redding wrapped up his weekend with an 11th place finish.\n\nThe WorldSBK now takes a one-week break before heading to the penultimate round of the season at Estoril, Portugal, from 11th to 13th. The season finale will be held just one week later at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP).\n\nReactions after the MotorLand Aragón round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another exciting weekend, one that can definitely be summed up with the word ‘comeback.’ You really have to give Toprak credit for the mental strength he’s shown after coming back from such a serious crash. In my eyes, he had a perfect weekend considering that he’s just come out of an injury break. He collected a lot of points, extended his lead in every race, and was always ahead of his title rival Nicolo Bulega. I think we can be very happy with that. Now we’re already preparing for the next two race weekends. On Mickey’s side of the garage, you could see how he became more comfortable with the bike as the weekend progressed. He had some really good moments in the race but also a bit of bad luck. But overall, the pace was there.\n\nWith Garrett, the upward trend is clear. He had a very good race weekend, especially Saturday with his podium! You really have to highlight the hard but fair fight with Toprak. It was great to see how the BMW riders treated each other fairly on the track and brought out the best for BMW together. Scott’s weekend was better overall than the previous one. He managed to achieve some better results and continues to get full support to set up the bike as best as possible for the races.\n\nOur conclusion: We are back! The championship fight is fully on again, and we’re going into the last two race weekends with a good points cushion. We’re looking forward to Estoril!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 5 / R01: 2 / SP Race: 2 / R02: 2): “I am happy because I did an incredibly good job this weekend and I enjoyed being back on my bike. I was riding more than 100 percent. The Superpole race today was really fun because for the first time this weekend I felt that the bike was really good. The bike was stopping and turning like I wanted and the feeling was much better. I was fighting with Bulega and I was not expecting that Bautista would attack in the chicane. Anyway, I was very close to the win. Alvaro is always very strong here, but not only him but all Ducatis. In race two, I again did my best to battle with him but on the last laps my rear tyre started to drop, and on the last laps, the Ducatis had more grip than the other bikes. And Alvaro was really pushing hard so I thought, okay, I settle for second position as it was impossible to catch him. Especially in the long corners, he had a big advantage. He did an incredible job, it looks like he has come back. I am happy for him. Now we have two more rounds and I will focus now on Estoril. I need to win there. Physically I only feel some muscle pain now but this is normal after this time without training. Especially the last race was very hard because the pace was very strong, everyone was pushing hard. On the bike, I am feeling good and I just need some training now. When we come to Estoril it will be much better because the feeling is improving every day. In general I am happy. Thinking of Estoril, maybe we can be World Champions there but at the moment I just focus on winning there because I love Estoril and after many wins, second position is a bit difficult for me. I hope that we will come back at Estoril.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 10 / R01: 3 / SP Race: 5 / R02: 5): “This was probably the best weekend I’ve had for a very long time. That’s definitely really positive. I’m nevertheless a bit disappointed because I thought I would have a bit more pace today to be able to stay in third. It feels like for some reason I was lacking a bit of pace compared to Nicolo, Alvaro and Toprak. They really just had a super fast pace today. I did everything that I could, I had a great battle with Iannone, but on the last lap I missed the shift, that didn’t help me at all. All in all it was a super good weekend with always being in the top five except of Superpole. I was feeling really comfortable on the bike in the last races and I have the feeling I am able to really push. All I needed was that the bike gets predictable for me and that I can ride a bit beyond it, so a lot of things came together with me, the bike and the team and it feels good. Now I’m looking forward to go to Estoril - I think it’s a good track for the BMWs and I really like the track, it has a great flow.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 11 / R01: 9 / SP Race: 8 / R02: 7): “The weekend started pretty tough, we struggled somehow on Friday, but Saturday went already much better. Superpole was ok. I think I could have done a little better lap, but P11 was not too bad. In race one, I had a really good start but unfortunately I couldn’t maintain the pace and dropped back a lot. So it was a shame because I was in some nice battles, and finished 9th in the first race. During the Superpole race, I had an ok start but I had two overtakes where I went wide, nearly off track. So I had to come from almost last. Finishing in the top ten has shown that I had a good pace. It wasn’t bad though but I was a little bit angry because I lost a lot of time at the beginning. Anyways, I was ready for race two and I had a fantastic start but struggled with the front of the bike at the beginning of the race. That’s why I couldn’t really stay with the guys in front of me. After a couple of laps I found a good rhythm to avoid the problems and I had a nice and consistent pace. I was really fast, so we managed to get some good points. But for Estoril for sure we want more.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 14 / R01: 11 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 11): “My weekend was pretty good. Getting some feeling with the bike on Friday and in the race on Saturday gave me some confidence. The warm up was reasonably good. In the Superpole race, I was battling for ninth position, but didn’t quite get it. But I was happy enough for tenth at this moment, even though I really wanted to be in the top nine. In race two I had a good start and a clean first lap and felt pretty good. The pace was faster this afternoon, but I just missed actually something. Not the pace itself, I was riding fast, strong, consistent but I just didn’t have the pace of the group in front. Also again this weekend, I was struggling a little bit to overtake without costing me and the other rider too much time. Overall I’m happy, because coming into this weekend I think me and everybody else thought it was going to be a really hard weekend for me and honestly I expected to be fighting in 15th position this weekend, because Aragón has been very difficult for me in the past. But the team and BMW have done a good job to put a package underneath me that I could build confidence with this weekend and to come away with some for me reasonable results here at Aragón. Now I can go home and see my son.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After missing two race weekends due to his severe crash at Magny-Cours (FRA), Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) made an impressive return.

After missing two race weekends due to his severe crash at Magny-Cours (FRA), Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) made an impressive return. The BMW Motorrad factory rider made his comeback in the tenth round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) – both on track and on the podium. After not still being able to compete the previous week at Cremona (ITA) due to a mild pneumothorax, Razgatlioglu was back to his usual strength on his ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team BMW M 1000 RR, finishing second in all three races. That extended his lead in the championship standings, now giving him a 39-point advantage. Saturday even saw a double podium for the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family as Garrett Gerloff (USA) from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, who had another strong weekend in Spain, finished third behind Razgatlioglu.\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED / ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) and Scott Redding (GBR / Bonovo action BMW Racing Team) also collected valuable points at MotorLand Aragón.\n\nRace one on Saturday afternoon turned into a real thriller, ending with BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s first WorldSBK double podium in three years. The race was red-flagged on the first lap due to track conditions. After the restart, the nearly 28,000 fans witnessed 17 laps of action-packed racing. At the front, a group battled fiercely for the lead and podium spots. Razgatlioglu, starting from fifth, and van der Mark, coming from eleventh, were right in the mix. Van der Mark fell back mid-race, but Gerloff, after an excellent comeback, was now in the thick of things. Starting from tenth, Gerloff climbed to third by lap nine and was hunting down the leaders. In the following laps, Razgatlioglu and Gerloff swapped second place several times, putting pressure on the race leader, Andrea Iannone (ITA / Ducati). After a nail-biting finish, Razgatlioglu finished second, and Gerloff took third, both stepping onto the podium together. Van der Mark finished ninth. Redding, who was pushed off track at the start and rejoined the race in 17th, fought his way back to 11th.\n\nSunday morning’s Superpole Race was no less thrilling. This time, a three-way battle for the lead went down to the wire. Razgatlioglu moved into second in lap two and battled with the two Ducati factory riders, Nicolo Bulega (ITA) and Alvaro Bautista (ESP). After several lead changes, the race was decided in the final moments, with Razgatlioglu securing second place for his second podium since his comeback. Gerloff aimed to improve his grid position for race two, which he successfully did by finishing fifth. Van der Mark impressed with another comeback, recovering from 18th at the start to finish eighth. Like Razgatlioglu and Gerloff, he also improved his starting position. Redding ensured all four BMW M 1000 RRs finished in the top ten, missing out on ninth by just two-tenths of a second to finish tenth.\n\nIn Sunday afternoon’s second main race, Bautista and Razgatlioglu sprinted away from the field. The pair broke multiple lap records while fighting for the win, with Razgatlioglu sticking closely to Bautista’s rear, waiting for his chance. However, in the closing stages, Razgatlioglu had to drop back slightly but still finished second for the third time during his comeback weekend. Gerloff was again in the fight for the podium and finished fifth. Van der Mark raced with the lead group early on and crossed the finish line in seventh after 18 laps. Redding wrapped up his weekend with an 11th place finish.\n\nThe WorldSBK now takes a one-week break before heading to the penultimate round of the season at Estoril, Portugal, from 11th to 13th. The season finale will be held just one week later at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP).\n\nReactions after the MotorLand Aragón round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another exciting weekend, one that can definitely be summed up with the word ‘comeback.’ You really have to give Toprak credit for the mental strength he’s shown after coming back from such a serious crash. In my eyes, he had a perfect weekend considering that he’s just come out of an injury break. He collected a lot of points, extended his lead in every race, and was always ahead of his title rival Nicolo Bulega. I think we can be very happy with that. Now we’re already preparing for the next two race weekends. On Mickey’s side of the garage, you could see how he became more comfortable with the bike as the weekend progressed. He had some really good moments in the race but also a bit of bad luck. But overall, the pace was there.\n\nWith Garrett, the upward trend is clear. He had a very good race weekend, especially Saturday with his podium! You really have to highlight the hard but fair fight with Toprak. It was great to see how the BMW riders treated each other fairly on the track and brought out the best for BMW together. Scott’s weekend was better overall than the previous one. He managed to achieve some better results and continues to get full support to set up the bike as best as possible for the races.\n\nOur conclusion: We are back! The championship fight is fully on again, and we’re going into the last two race weekends with a good points cushion. We’re looking forward to Estoril!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 5 / R01: 2 / SP Race: 2 / R02: 2): “I am happy because I did an incredibly good job this weekend and I enjoyed being back on my bike. I was riding more than 100 percent. The Superpole race today was really fun because for the first time this weekend I felt that the bike was really good. The bike was stopping and turning like I wanted and the feeling was much better. I was fighting with Bulega and I was not expecting that Bautista would attack in the chicane. Anyway, I was very close to the win. Alvaro is always very strong here, but not only him but all Ducatis. In race two, I again did my best to battle with him but on the last laps my rear tyre started to drop, and on the last laps, the Ducatis had more grip than the other bikes. And Alvaro was really pushing hard so I thought, okay, I settle for second position as it was impossible to catch him. Especially in the long corners, he had a big advantage. He did an incredible job, it looks like he has come back. I am happy for him. Now we have two more rounds and I will focus now on Estoril. I need to win there. Physically I only feel some muscle pain now but this is normal after this time without training. Especially the last race was very hard because the pace was very strong, everyone was pushing hard. On the bike, I am feeling good and I just need some training now. When we come to Estoril it will be much better because the feeling is improving every day. In general I am happy. Thinking of Estoril, maybe we can be World Champions there but at the moment I just focus on winning there because I love Estoril and after many wins, second position is a bit difficult for me. I hope that we will come back at Estoril.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 10 / R01: 3 / SP Race: 5 / R02: 5): “This was probably the best weekend I’ve had for a very long time.

We’re looking forward to Estoril!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 5 / R01: 2 / SP Race: 2 / R02: 2): “I am happy because I did an incredibly good job this weekend and I enjoyed being back on my bike. I was riding more than 100 percent. The Superpole race today was really fun because for the first time this weekend I felt that the bike was really good. The bike was stopping and turning like I wanted and the feeling was much better. I was fighting with Bulega and I was not expecting that Bautista would attack in the chicane. Anyway, I was very close to the win. Alvaro is always very strong here, but not only him but all Ducatis. In race two, I again did my best to battle with him but on the last laps my rear tyre started to drop, and on the last laps, the Ducatis had more grip than the other bikes. And Alvaro was really pushing hard so I thought, okay, I settle for second position as it was impossible to catch him. Especially in the long corners, he had a big advantage. He did an incredible job, it looks like he has come back. I am happy for him. Now we have two more rounds and I will focus now on Estoril. I need to win there. Physically I only feel some muscle pain now but this is normal after this time without training. Especially the last race was very hard because the pace was very strong, everyone was pushing hard. On the bike, I am feeling good and I just need some training now. When we come to Estoril it will be much better because the feeling is improving every day. In general I am happy. Thinking of Estoril, maybe we can be World Champions there but at the moment I just focus on winning there because I love Estoril and after many wins, second position is a bit difficult for me. I hope that we will come back at Estoril.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 10 / R01: 3 / SP Race: 5 / R02: 5): “This was probably the best weekend I’ve had for a very long time. That’s definitely really positive. I’m nevertheless a bit disappointed because I thought I would have a bit more pace today to be able to stay in third. It feels like for some reason I was lacking a bit of pace compared to Nicolo, Alvaro and Toprak. They really just had a super fast pace today. I did everything that I could, I had a great battle with Iannone, but on the last lap I missed the shift, that didn’t help me at all. All in all it was a super good weekend with always being in the top five except of Superpole. I was feeling really comfortable on the bike in the last races and I have the feeling I am able to really push. All I needed was that the bike gets predictable for me and that I can ride a bit beyond it, so a lot of things came together with me, the bike and the team and it feels good. Now I’m looking forward to go to Estoril - I think it’s a good track for the BMWs and I really like the track, it has a great flow.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 11 / R01: 9 / SP Race: 8 / R02: 7): “The weekend started pretty tough, we struggled somehow on Friday, but Saturday went already much better. Superpole was ok. I think I could have done a little better lap, but P11 was not too bad. In race one, I had a really good start but unfortunately I couldn’t maintain the pace and dropped back a lot. So it was a shame because I was in some nice battles, and finished 9th in the first race. During the Superpole race, I had an ok start but I had two overtakes where I went wide, nearly off track. So I had to come from almost last. Finishing in the top ten has shown that I had a good pace. It wasn’t bad though but I was a little bit angry because I lost a lot of time at the beginning. Anyways, I was ready for race two and I had a fantastic start but struggled with the front of the bike at the beginning of the race. That’s why I couldn’t really stay with the guys in front of me. After a couple of laps I found a good rhythm to avoid the problems and I had a nice and consistent pace. I was really fast, so we managed to get some good points. But for Estoril for sure we want more.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 14 / R01: 11 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 11): “My weekend was pretty good. Getting some feeling with the bike on Friday and in the race on Saturday gave me some confidence. The warm up was reasonably good. In the Superpole race, I was battling for ninth position, but didn’t quite get it. But I was happy enough for tenth at this moment, even though I really wanted to be in the top nine. In race two I had a good start and a clean first lap and felt pretty good. The pace was faster this afternoon, but I just missed actually something. Not the pace itself, I was riding fast, strong, consistent but I just didn’t have the pace of the group in front. Also again this weekend, I was struggling a little bit to overtake without costing me and the other rider too much time. Overall I’m happy, because coming into this weekend I think me and everybody else thought it was going to be a really hard weekend for me and honestly I expected to be fighting in 15th position this weekend, because Aragón has been very difficult for me in the past. But the team and BMW have done a good job to put a package underneath me that I could build confidence with this weekend and to come away with some for me reasonable results here at Aragón. Now I can go home and see my son.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The BMW Group Plant Steyr today began series production of the e-engine for the Neue Klasse. “Today, we are laying the foundations for the future of the BMW Group,” explained Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production. “As the first production site for the Gen6 electric engine, Plant Steyr is central to the Neue Klasse and the continued development of our global production network.” The electric engine for the sixth generation of BMW eDrive (Gen6) is the first fully-electric drive train to be produced at the Steyr location in Austria. From there, it will be shipped throughout the production network, providing the drive train for the Neue Klasse. “Three years ago, we announced that we would build this electric engine in Steyr. Today, we are proud to deliver it,” said Klaus von Moltke, SVP of Engine Production for BMW AG and plant director of the Steyr facility. “What we are launching here today is more than just a production ramp-up. It is a firm commitment to Europe, to technology and to the future.”\n\nTechnology openness: Plant Steyr as centre of drive train expertise\n\nBetween the project launch in 2022 and 2030, the BMW Group is investing over one billion euros in expanding development and production expertise for e-drives at the Steyr location. This capacity expansion will ensure the plant remains the BMW Group's leading location for drive trains. For over 40 years, the plant has developed and manufactured internal combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands. This extensive experience and wealth of expertise in drive trains make the engine plant the ideal facility to produce the Gen6 electric engines. The site will continue to manufacture diesel and petrol engines in parallel. “Technology openness is our strength – it gives us the necessary flexibility to secure long-term jobs,” said von Moltke. Around 1,000 employees will work in the new electric engine assembly. Depending on global demand, half of the Steyr location’s total workforce could be employed in e-mobility by 2030. von Moltke: “Steyr will remain the heart of our drive train expertise – both for combustion engines and electromobility.”\n\nPowertrain components produced in Steyr, aluminium housings from Landshut\n\nRotor, stator, transmission and inverter – all core components of the innovative, highly integrated e-drive – will be manufactured at Plant Steyr. The housing for the electric engine will be cast at Plant Landshut's aluminium foundry and further processed in Steyr. The inverter will be produced in a new in-house clean-room environment, marking the Austrian engine manufacturer’s entry into the field of electrical engineering. E-drive components from Steyr will be assembled on two new lines. The overall production concept for the Gen6 e-drive follows the principle of a modular system, making it possible to produce different highly flexible electric drive train derivatives for the entire range of Neue Klasse models. The modular concept generates positive economies of scale and cost savings in both development and production. It also improves the scalability of production volumes and keeps production, supply networks and procurement highly flexible.\n\nComprehensive improvements to electric engine\n\nThe electric engine has undergone significant further development for Gen6: The rotor, stator and inverter have all been holistically designed for the Gen6 technology’s new 800-volt architecture, maximising performance capabilities and the efficiency of the drive system. In the inverter, 800-volt technology and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor technology are now being used to boost efficiency. Fully integrated into the electric engine housing, the inverter converts direct current from the high-voltage battery into alternating current for the electric engine.\n\nLower weight, costs and energy loss lead to greater vehicle efficiency\n\nOverall, the intelligent use of new technologies in the e-drive and systematic further development of existing systems produce remarkable results. Comparing the future BMW iX3 50 xDrive with a Gen5 xDrive model shows the following improvements in the electric engine: “Energy loss is reduced by 40 percent, costs by 20 percent and weight by 10 percent. All this makes a significant contribution to the approximately 20-percent increase in overall vehicle efficiency”, explains Martin Kaufmann, SVP of global Powertrain Development at BMW AG.

From there, it will be shipped throughout the production network, providing the drive train for the Neue Klasse. “Three years ago, we announced that we would build this electric engine in Steyr. Today, we are proud to deliver it,” said Klaus von Moltke, SVP of Engine Production for BMW AG and plant director of the Steyr facility. “What we are launching here today is more than just a production ramp-up. It is a firm commitment to Europe, to technology and to the future.”\n\nTechnology openness: Plant Steyr as centre of drive train expertise\n\nBetween the project launch in 2022 and 2030, the BMW Group is investing over one billion euros in expanding development and production expertise for e-drives at the Steyr location. This capacity expansion will ensure the plant remains the BMW Group's leading location for drive trains. For over 40 years, the plant has developed and manufactured internal combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands. This extensive experience and wealth of expertise in drive trains make the engine plant the ideal facility to produce the Gen6 electric engines. The site will continue to manufacture diesel and petrol engines in parallel. “Technology openness is our strength – it gives us the necessary flexibility to secure long-term jobs,” said von Moltke. Around 1,000 employees will work in the new electric engine assembly. Depending on global demand, half of the Steyr location’s total workforce could be employed in e-mobility by 2030. von Moltke: “Steyr will remain the heart of our drive train expertise – both for combustion engines and electromobility.”\n\nPowertrain components produced in Steyr, aluminium housings from Landshut\n\nRotor, stator, transmission and inverter – all core components of the innovative, highly integrated e-drive – will be manufactured at Plant Steyr. The housing for the electric engine will be cast at Plant Landshut's aluminium foundry and further processed in Steyr. The inverter will be produced in a new in-house clean-room environment, marking the Austrian engine manufacturer’s entry into the field of electrical engineering. E-drive components from Steyr will be assembled on two new lines. The overall production concept for the Gen6 e-drive follows the principle of a modular system, making it possible to produce different highly flexible electric drive train derivatives for the entire range of Neue Klasse models. The modular concept generates positive economies of scale and cost savings in both development and production. It also improves the scalability of production volumes and keeps production, supply networks and procurement highly flexible.\n\nComprehensive improvements to electric engine\n\nThe electric engine has undergone significant further development for Gen6: The rotor, stator and inverter have all been holistically designed for the Gen6 technology’s new 800-volt architecture, maximising performance capabilities and the efficiency of the drive system. In the inverter, 800-volt technology and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor technology are now being used to boost efficiency. Fully integrated into the electric engine housing, the inverter converts direct current from the high-voltage battery into alternating current for the electric engine.\n\nLower weight, costs and energy loss lead to greater vehicle efficiency\n\nOverall, the intelligent use of new technologies in the e-drive and systematic further development of existing systems produce remarkable results. Comparing the future BMW iX3 50 xDrive with a Gen5 xDrive model shows the following improvements in the electric engine: “Energy loss is reduced by 40 percent, costs by 20 percent and weight by 10 percent. All this makes a significant contribution to the approximately 20-percent increase in overall vehicle efficiency”, explains Martin Kaufmann, SVP of global Powertrain Development at BMW AG. The efficient design of the powertrain together with the high energy content of the high-voltage battery, enable a range of up to 800 km (WLTP) in the BMW iX3 50 xDrive, the first model of the Neue Klasse."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

BMW Group Plant Regensburg has achieved another major milestone: As projected, the threshold of 100,000 fully-electric vehicles produced since the start of the year was reached today. The milestone vehicle, which came off the assembly line in Regensburg today, watched by Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production, is a BMW iX1. The vehicle, finished in Blue Bay Lagoon metallic, will be shipped to overseas, to the island of La Réunion. The plant has produced this successful premium compact model for customers worldwide since November 2022.\n\nNedeljković: “We offer a very wide range of fully-electric vehicles across all key segments. Our German plants produce these vehicles for the global market, delivering a major contribution to the growth of e-mobility.”\n\nRegensburg Plant Director Armin Ebner offers a correspondingly positive assessment of the year: “We are meeting customer needs with our BMW iX1 and BMW iX2 models. I am especially proud of our team at Plant Regensburg, who once again showed tremendous commitment and flexibility, despite volatile market conditions. We have achieved our projected growth target for production of fully-electric vehicles in Regensburg in 2024, as promised.\n\nMore than a third of the vehicles built at our plant this year were electrified – i.e. a plug-in hybrid or an all-electric model. In 2024, we will substantially exceed last year's figure of 238,301 BMW vehicles built in Regensburg –with annual production of well over 330,000 units in total.”\n\nMore than 1,400 BMW X1 and BMW X2 models are currently coming off the production line at BMW Group Plant Regensburg every workday. The core BMW X1 model will be produced with all drive train variants: as a combustion-engine vehicle and plug-in hybrid, alongside the fully-electric BMW iX1.\n\n“Our plant has become even more digital, more circular and more efficient overall this year,” says Ebner. “We are systematically driving our transformation towards electromobility and the BMW iFactory – an intelligently connected digital factory.” Recent accolades, such as being named “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 in the category “excellent large-series assembly” and receiving the “Best Cars Award” for the BMW X1 from trade journal auto motor und sport in 2024, provide impressive proof of this. “I would like to extend a big thank you to our entire plant team and our partners for everything we have achieved together.”\n\nMartina Hatzel, Communications Production Network\n\nMedia website: \n\nBMW Group Plants Regensburg and WackersdorfThe BMW Group vehicle plant in Regensburg has been in operation since 1986 and is one of more than 30 BMW Group production locations worldwide. Every workday, around 1,400 vehicles of the BMW X1 and BMW X2 models roll off the production line at Plant Regensburg, destined for customers around the globe. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on a single production line – ranging from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models.\n\nBMW Group Plant Regensburg was recognised as “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 in the category “excellent large-series assembly” of the prestigious industrial competition. As it implements the BMW iFACTORY, the BMW Group is focused on digitalisation of the Regensburg plant site to create a digital and intelligently connected factory. It is already possible to experience in virtual form what the factory will look like a few years from now. Production of models for the NEUE KLASSE, BMW’s next generation of vehicles, will ramp up in Regensburg in the second half of the decade.\n\nThe BMW Group plant in Wackersdorf is home to cockpit production and parts supply for overseas plants. With the opening of a new battery testing centre and commissioning of the first phase in autumn 2024, the location has also become a key facilitator for electromobility.

BMW Group Plant Regensburg has achieved another major milestone: As projected, the threshold of 100,000 fully-electric vehicles produced since the start of the year was reached today. The milestone vehicle, which came off the assembly line in Regensburg today, watched by Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production, is a BMW iX1.

We have achieved our projected growth target for production of fully-electric vehicles in Regensburg in 2024, as promised.\n\nMore than a third of the vehicles built at our plant this year were electrified – i.e. a plug-in hybrid or an all-electric model.

During a media event at Spa (BEL), BMW M Team WRT introduced the BMW M4 GT3 drivers for the 2024 season in the LMGT3 class of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS (GTWC). BMW M works driver Maxime Martin (BEL) will participate in both the FIA WEC and GTWC alongside Valentino Rossi (ITA). In the LMGT3 class, the line-up is completed by three drivers: Sean Gelael (INA), Ahmad Al-Harthy (OMA), and Darren Leung (GBR). In the GTWC, Dries Vanthoor and Charles Weerts (both BEL) will contest the entire season, joined by Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Jens Klingmann (GER) in the Endurance Cup.\n\nThe FIA WEC regulations stipulate that each LMGT3 car must have drivers from all FIA categories. Specifically, this means that in addition to a driver with Platinum or Gold status, a Silver and a Bronze-rated driver must form the crew of a car. In the BMW M Team WRT #31 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M factory driver Augusto Farfus (BRA) shares the cockpit with Silver driver Sean Gelael, BMW M Ambassador for Indonesia, and Bronze driver Darren Leung. In the #46 BMW M4 GT3, alongside Silver-rated Valentino Rossi (ITA), Maxime Martin and Ahmad Al-Harthy will be in action.\n\nIn the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, Dries Vanthoor and Charles Weerts, as an established duo, are aiming for the title. They participate in both the Sprint Cup and the Endurance Cup. For the endurance races, including the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), they will be supported by Sheldon van der Linde. Valentino Rossi, Maxime Martin, and Raffaele Marciello compete in the Endurance Cup, with Rossi and Martin also participating in selected Sprint Cup events. Klingmann will compete in the Bronze class of the Endurance Cup together with Al-Harthy and Sam de Haan (GBR).\n\nComments on the line-up:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “In our second season together, BMW M Team WRT has a packed racing calendar full of highlights. After the Hypercar line-up in the FIA WEC, the driver line-ups for the BMW M4 GT3 in the two main series for the team, the FIA WEC and GT World Challenge Europe, are now set. I congratulate Vincent Vosse and his colleagues for securing excellent amateur drivers for the LMGT3 class. With these crews, I see a very good chance to play a leading role in this category. In the GTWC, BMW M Team WRT, with a proven line-up and strengthened by Raffaele Marciello, takes a new shot at winning titles with the BMW M4 GT3. I wish the team and drivers success in all programs!”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “In GT racing, we had a positive start to our collaboration with BMW M Motorsport last year. We took up the challenges, we won races, long-distance and sprint ones, and we collected some memorable moments like those lived in Misano. But we want more! We want to improve, to win more races, to be champions again. I think we have what it takes, including stellar line-ups, and we’ll go for it. Now is the time, to show we know what to do, with the determination and the passion we have always had.”\n\nMaxime Martin: “I am very excited to return to the FIA WEC for a full season in a completely new class. With Valentino and Ahmad, we have a very strong crew. The competition will undoubtedly be exciting and high-class. I can’t wait to get started again. In the GTWC, I want to give my all to continue the success from last season together with Valentino and our new teammate Raffaele Marciello.”\n\nValentino Rossi: “I am very happy with my 2024 programme and I can’t wait to start. In the Fanatec GT World Challenge, I’ll race the Endurance Cup together with Maxime and Lello, two fantastic drivers and I think we can be very strong. Additionally, I will be doing two races of the Sprint Cup with Maxime, Misano and Brands Hatch, two tracks where we did very well last year. The WEC will be new for me; I’ll be with Maxime and Ahmad, and I’m eager to race in the main event at Le Mans, and at places like Austin and São Paulo, a brand new experience for me and hopefully we will be competitive.”\n\nAugusto Farfus: “I feel honoured to be part of the WEC project of BMW M Motorsport and WRT, I always wanted to have a full campaign in the WEC and now is the right time to join the new platform. We have a strong package, we are eager to share the experience and we are ready for the WEC and Le Mans.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello: “The GT World Challenge Europe has given me many great successes in recent years.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nHockenheim. The dream of a fourth DTM drivers' title for René Rast (GER) has been shattered. In the final race of the season at the Hockenheimring (GER), the 38-year-old had excellent chances in the showdown for the championship after a strong start, running in second place. However, a collision in the first lap ended all his hopes. On Friday, ahead of the race weekend, Rast had announced his provisional retirement from DTM. Marco Wittmann (GER) shone in the Sunday race, securing a podium finish in second place during a dramatic season finale.\n\nAfter finishing seventh on Saturday, Rast started Sunday’s race from fifth position but quickly moved up to second place in the first few corners thanks to a brilliant start. However, at the hairpin, he was pushed wide and, as a result of a chain reaction, was hit twice by other cars. His #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO sustained such severe damage that he had to retire from the race in the very first lap, ending his bid for a fourth DTM title. A victory, which was well within reach, would have been enough to crown him champion. Thus, Rast concluded what is, at least for now, his final DTM season in position sixth in the drivers' standings.\n\nOn Friday, Rast had already announced that he would not compete in DTM in 2026, choosing instead to focus on other race programmes with BMW M Motorsport. Over eight full seasons, Rast achieved three titles, 31 victories, and 26 pole positions. He did not rule out a potential return to DTM at a later date.\n\nFor Marco Wittmann, the season ended with a fantastic comeback and a dramatic final lap. Starting from 17th on the grid, Wittmann climbed to second place and challenged Ayhancan Güven (TUR, Porsche) for the race win in the final sprint, as Güven was fighting for the championship title. Wittmann initially overtook Güven but was countered by a bold move from Güven just a few corners before the finish line. Thanks to his second-place finish, Wittmann ended the season in position five in the drivers' standings. Schubert Motorsport secured second place in the team standings. The team from Oschersleben (GER) celebrated a total of three victories by Rast and six additional podium finishes in 2025 – two for Rast and four for Wittmann.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Podium finish for FK Performance Motorsport to close the season. As in the DTM, BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers were in the title fight until the final weekend in Hockenheim in the supporting series ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany. However, the ultimate success also eluded them there. In the ADAC GT Masters, the FK Performance Motorsport duo Leyton Fourie (RSA) and Tim Zimmermann (GER) in the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO ended the season on a positive note with a second-place podium finish.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Congratulations to Marco Wittmann for a fantastic podium finish in Sunday’s race. That was a very strong performance. However, looking at the championship, the disappointment naturally outweighs the positives. After Marco was practically out of the race on Saturday due to a tyre issue, things looked very promising for René Rast. He had a strong weekend and was already in second place after the start on Sunday. Unfortunately, the collision at the hairpin cost him all his chances. We would have preferred to fight for the title until the final lap, but it wasn’t meant to be. Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport for a very good season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. We were in the title race with both drivers until the final weekend, which underscores our consistently strong performance. The pit stops by the crews were especially outstanding. Congratulations to Ayhancan Güven and Manthey EMA on winning the title!\"\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"We can all be proud of this DTM season. We were in the title fight until the very end and have made significant progress compared to last year. René Rast and Marco Wittmann were very close throughout the season and brought success to the team together. It’s bitter that the season ended this way. We lost René in the first lap, and Marco would have deserved the win in the final race. Unfortunately, it wasn’t meant to be, but we’ll come back stronger next season.

Marco stormed from 17th to second place and truly deserved the win. He drove a fantastic race. Overall, we had a good season and celebrated several victories.

Nevertheless, it was a nice season finale for me. Of course, I feel very sorry for René that he was taken out of the race so early. I think we had a strong package today. Overall, it was a crazy season with a title fight that I believe is rare in DTM. We lost too much ground at some events, which ultimately took us out of the title fight.

To be taken out of the title fight in this way in the first lap is incredibly bitter. This is not the conclusion I had dreamed of for my DTM career. However, I decided some time ago to at least temporarily end my DTM journey. I will not be competing in the DTM in 2026.

The dream of a fourth DTM drivers' title for René Rast (GER) has been shattered. In the final race of the season at the Hockenheimring (GER), the 38-year-old had excellent chances in the showdown for the championship after a strong start, running in second place. However, a collision in the first lap ended all his hopes. On Friday, ahead of the race weekend, Rast had announced his provisional retirement from DTM. Marco Wittmann (GER) shone in the Sunday race, securing a podium finish in second place during a dramatic season finale.\n\nAfter finishing seventh on Saturday, Rast started Sunday’s race from fifth position but quickly moved up to second place in the first few corners thanks to a brilliant start. However, at the hairpin, he was pushed wide and, as a result of a chain reaction, was hit twice by other cars. His #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO sustained such severe damage that he had to retire from the race in the very first lap, ending his bid for a fourth DTM title. A victory, which was well within reach, would have been enough to crown him champion. Thus, Rast concluded what is, at least for now, his final DTM season in position sixth in the drivers' standings.\n\nOn Friday, Rast had already announced that he would not compete in DTM in 2026, choosing instead to focus on other race programmes with BMW M Motorsport. Over eight full seasons, Rast achieved three titles, 31 victories, and 26 pole positions. He did not rule out a potential return to DTM at a later date.\n\nFor Marco Wittmann, the season ended with a fantastic comeback and a dramatic final lap. Starting from 17th on the grid, Wittmann climbed to second place and challenged Ayhancan Güven (TUR, Porsche) for the race win in the final sprint, as Güven was fighting for the championship title. Wittmann initially overtook Güven but was countered by a bold move from Güven just a few corners before the finish line. Thanks to his second-place finish, Wittmann ended the season in position five in the drivers' standings. Schubert Motorsport secured second place in the team standings. The team from Oschersleben (GER) celebrated a total of three victories by Rast and six additional podium finishes in 2025 – two for Rast and four for Wittmann.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Podium finish for FK Performance Motorsport to close the season. As in the DTM, BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers were in the title fight until the final weekend in Hockenheim in the supporting series ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany. However, the ultimate success also eluded them there. In the ADAC GT Masters, the FK Performance Motorsport duo Leyton Fourie (RSA) and Tim Zimmermann (GER) in the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO ended the season on a positive note with a second-place podium finish.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Congratulations to Marco Wittmann for a fantastic podium finish in Sunday’s race. That was a very strong performance. However, looking at the championship, the disappointment naturally outweighs the positives. After Marco was practically out of the race on Saturday due to a tyre issue, things looked very promising for René Rast.

Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport for a very good season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO.

On 7 June, the “Belle Macchine. Italian Automotive Design at BMW” exhibition will open its doors at the BMW Museum. With its famed sense for timeless aesthetics, Italy has set standards in fashion, interior and product design for as long as anyone can remember. And Italian designers have also left an enduring mark on the automotive world. This exhibition explores the influence of Italian design at BMW and provides a fascinating retrospective on the evolution of coachbuilding and body design over the past few decades.\n\nBMW has drawn inspiration from Italian coachbuilding culture since as far back as the 1930s. Collaborations with renowned designers such as Giorgetto Giugiaro, Giovanni Michelotti and Marcello Gandini produced icons that have made a lasting impression on the brand. “BMW has harnessed Italian influences to create automotive design that blends class and elegance with modern forms and functionality. The combination of Italian design and German engineering excellence was a key driver of BMW’s growth into a premium manufacturer,” explain curators Anna Schleypen and Klaus-Anton Altenbuchner. The exhibition illustrates this development with a variety of design sketches from the BMW Design Archive, a selection of exhibits and 23 historic vehicles, and provides a captivating insight into the design history of BMW.\n\nA tour of the exhibition“Belle Macchine. Italian Automotive Design at BMW” extends over five platforms and ramps within the BMW Museum’s iconic “Bowl”. It starts with a general introduction into the world of Italian design, citing examples of the country’s endeavours in the fields of fashion and product design. The impact of noted Italian studios on the design of bodies for BMW vehicles occupies much of the exhibition space. For example, the BMW Garmisch concept car penned by Marcello Gandini represents the essence of Italian style and played a major role in the design of the original BMW 3 Series and 5 Series of the 1970s. As is clear from the numerous production cars on display, such as the popular BMW 1800 TI/SA, the stylistic influence of Italian designers was leveraged to successful effect by a large number of models. BMW’s acquisition of fellow carmaker Glas is also brought under the spotlight with a three-strong line-up including the BMW 3000 V8, affectionately known as the “Glaserati”. The exhibition continues with a showcase of perfectly formed one-offs like the BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupé, BMW 2800 GTS Frua and BMW Nazca M12 designed by Fabrizio Giugiaro. These models were commissioned by the company to serve as sources of creative inspiration or put forward by the Italian designers themselves to ensure they were part of the conversation when BMW was scouting for partners.\n\nOn the ramps between the platforms, visitors are taken on a visual road-trip with stop-offs including the legendary Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como – a beauty contest for historic vehicles of unparalleled tradition. The design drawings on show here provide further evidence of the artistic signature of Italian designers. The exhibition finishes on a high with a model of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse – the modern successor to the Italian-flavoured original Neue Klasse of yesteryear – and special study vehicles such as the BMW M1 Hommage. These cars see BMW recognising the achievements of the Italian designers of the time and re-interpreting its own design history as a source of inspiration for its latest creations.\n\nIn another visual highlight, the exhibition area is enveloped in a 360-degree display – projected onto the walls of the “Bowl” – that showcases the work of Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, who studied for a time in Munich."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On 7 June, the “Belle Macchine.

The combination of Italian design and German engineering excellence was a key driver of BMW’s growth into a premium manufacturer,” explain curators Anna Schleypen and Klaus-Anton Altenbuchner.

Thanks to close coordination with customer teams, it has been possible to further optimise the already very strong car to an even higher level.\n\nReliability and improved drivability are the two areas where the BMW M4 GT4 EVO has received the most significant updates.

With 77 victories and numerous title wins, the BMW M4 GT4 was already a guarantor of success in its first year of competition in 2023. Although the car continues to race from success to success worldwide in the current season, BMW M Motorsport is not resting on its laurels but is presenting details of the EVO version of the BMW M4 GT4 on the sidelines of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), and is set to provide even better driving experiences from 2025. Thanks to close coordination with customer teams, it has been possible to further optimise the already very strong car to an even higher level.\n\nReliability and improved drivability are the two areas where the BMW M4 GT4 EVO has received the most significant updates. The front splitter has been revised to improve long-term durability, and the entire attachment concept has been overhauled, making the entire front end much more maintenance-friendly. Reinforced wheel bearings on the rear axle and new front flicks also increase durability.\n\nThe engineers made adjustments in terms of performance and drivability; drivers now have the option to temporarily deactivate the traction control via a button on the steering wheel. This gives the drivers another way to optimise lap times. That was a requirement brought to the BMW M Motorsport engineers and the development drivers Jens Klingmann, Max Hesse (both GER), and Dan Harper (GBR) by numerous customers.\n\nIn terms of design, the BMW M4 GT4 EVO follows its big brother from the GT3 category.

BMW M Motorsport looks back on an intense but also highly successful 2025 season. While the BMW M Hybrid V8 experienced highs and lows, the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 with their EVO versions provided plenty of reasons to celebrate. In our season review, we reflect on the most important victories and titles and share other interesting figures from the 2025 racing year. A list of title wins follows at the end of the press release.\n\nLMDh: Strong season start, but also some disappointments. The year of the BMW M Hybrid V8 began with an impressive streak of four consecutive pole positions by Dries Vanthoor (BEL) in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. At the end of the third season of the Hypercar in North America, the results included four poles, a 1-2 finish at Road America (USA), and two third-places at Long Beach and Laguna Seca (both USA). In the drivers' standings, Vanthoor and Philipp Eng (AUT) finished fourth. The FIA WEC season also started strongly with a front-row start in Qatar and second place in the race at Imola (ITA). However, the second half of the season was disappointing for BMW M Team WRT.\n\nFacts and figures: The BMW M Hybrid V8 completed over 70,000 racing kilometres in the 2025 season, approximately 39,000 in the FIA WEC and around 31,000 in the IMSA Series. During 36 test days, nearly 33,000 test kilometres were covered – around 23,000 in the FIA WEC and approximately 10,000 in the IMSA Series.\n\nGT3: Triumphant season with a highlight at the Nürburgring. The 2025 season with the BMW M4 GT3 was almost a continuous triumph. It began in February with a 1-2 finish at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), the last race of the old model. The EVO version seamlessly continued the success story. The highlight was ROWE Racing's victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), marking BMW M Motorsport's 21st overall win in the \"Green Hell\". Other major individual successes with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO included Team WRT's wins at the Suzuka 1000KM (JPN) and the Indianapolis 8 Hour (USA), as well as Paul Miller Racing's triumphs in the GTD-PRO class at the 6 Hours of the Glen and Petit Le Mans (both USA). Key title wins in 2025 included the drivers' and teams' titles in the GT World Challenge Europe with Team WRT, as well as the drivers' and manufacturers' titles in the Intercontinental GT Challenge, where BMW M Motorsport achieved four wins in five season races. Additionally, the GTD-PRO drivers', teams', and manufacturers' titles in the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup were secured. Driver of the season was Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). In his debut year as a BMW M works driver, he won the 24h Nürburgring and the drivers' titles in the GT World Challenge Europe (Overall and Sprint standings) and the Intercontinental GT Challenge.\n\nFacts and figures: 56 BMW M4 GT3s were in action worldwide during the 2025 season, most of them EVO models. More than 80 victories and 100 additional podium finishes were achieved, and over 400,000 racing kilometres were completed.\n\nGT4: Over 100 victories – biggest triumphs at the Nürburgring. The smaller sibling of the BMW M4 GT3 also achieved impressive successes in the 2025 season. The biggest triumphs came at the Nürburgring. At the 24-hour race, Team AV Racing by BLACK FALCON won the SP10 class with the EVO version of the car. FK Performance Motorsport triumphed in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) in nine out of ten races in the SP8T category, securing the overall NLS victory for drivers Nick Wüstenhagen (GER) and Ranko Mijatovic (SUI). While titles were not achieved in the major European GT4 racing series – the GT European Series and ADAC GT4 Germany – the BMW M4 GT4 EVO dominated in GT4 America across all classes. Thanks to consistently strong results from GT4 teams, BMW M Motorsport secured the SRO manufacturers' title in the GT4 class.\n\nFacts and figures: 88 BMW M4 GT4s were in racing action worldwide in 2025. They achieved over 100 victories and around 150 additional podium finishes. BMW M Motorsport teams covered approximately 330,000 racing kilometres.\n\nEsports World Cup: Successfully defended title. BMW M Motorsport is also highly active in virtual racing, and its three automotive gaming teams continued their success streak in 2025. The highlight was the Esports World Cup (EWC), a four-day competition on the \"Rennsport\" platform. BMW M Team Redline triumphed for the second consecutive time with drivers Luke Bennett (GBR), Sebastian Job (GBR), Jeffrey Rietveld (NED), and Kevin Siggy (SLO).\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Overall, we at BMW M Motorsport look back on a very successful 2025 season. Many thanks to everyone whose hard work contributed to this record. With our BMW M Hybrid V8, the conclusion is mixed. In the first half of the season, we were very satisfied with the car's pace in both the IMSA Series and the FIA WEC. Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve the corresponding race results. While we celebrated the 1-2 finish at Road America in the second half of the season, we generally had higher expectations. We will analyse in detail over the winter what caused this, so we can return much stronger in 2026 with the updated version of our car. With the BMW M4 GT3, we had an almost dream season. The title wins in some of the most important GT3 racing series and the individual victories at the Nürburgring and Bathurst were major highlights. In the DTM, we fought for the title until the last race and stood on the podium multiple times in the FIA WEC. I am also very pleased with the BMW M4 GT4's strong performance. This car symbolises our close connection to customer racing, whose heart lies in the GT4 category. In 2026, the BMW M2 Racing will be added as a new entry-level car, completing our portfolio of customer racing cars.

Thanks to consistently strong results from GT4 teams, BMW M Motorsport secured the SRO manufacturers' title in the GT4 class.\n\nFacts and figures: 88 BMW M4 GT4s were in racing action worldwide in 2025. They achieved over 100 victories and around 150 additional podium finishes. BMW M Motorsport teams covered approximately 330,000 racing kilometres.\n\nEsports World Cup: Successfully defended title. BMW M Motorsport is also highly active in virtual racing, and its three automotive gaming teams continued their success streak in 2025. The highlight was the Esports World Cup (EWC), a four-day competition on the \"Rennsport\" platform. BMW M Team Redline triumphed for the second consecutive time with drivers Luke Bennett (GBR), Sebastian Job (GBR), Jeffrey Rietveld (NED), and Kevin Siggy (SLO).\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Overall, we at BMW M Motorsport look back on a very successful 2025 season. Many thanks to everyone whose hard work contributed to this record. With our BMW M Hybrid V8, the conclusion is mixed. In the first half of the season, we were very satisfied with the car's pace in both the IMSA Series and the FIA WEC. Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve the corresponding race results. While we celebrated the 1-2 finish at Road America in the second half of the season, we generally had higher expectations. We will analyse in detail over the winter what caused this, so we can return much stronger in 2026 with the updated version of our car. With the BMW M4 GT3, we had an almost dream season. The title wins in some of the most important GT3 racing series and the individual victories at the Nürburgring and Bathurst were major highlights. In the DTM, we fought for the title until the last race and stood on the podium multiple times in the FIA WEC. I am also very pleased with the BMW M4 GT4's strong performance. This car symbolises our close connection to customer racing, whose heart lies in the GT4 category. In 2026, the BMW M2 Racing will be added as a new entry-level car, completing our portfolio of customer racing cars. I can't wait for the action to resume in January after a well-deserved Christmas break.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Texas, Austin, COTA: A spectacular racetrack will host the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) this coming weekend (30th August to 1st September). The 6-hour Lone Star Le Mans race at Circuit of The Americas in Austin (USA) marks the sixth round of the 2024 FIA WEC season for BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team WRT.\n\nOne challenge for all teams will be the high temperatures in Austin, which can reach nearly 40 degrees Celsius during the race weekend. In the Hypercar class, the goal is to demonstrate the potential of the BMW M Hybrid V8 with strong results. Behind the wheel of the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) will take turns. In the #20 car, Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) will compete.\n\nIn the race for the World Championship title in the LMGT3 class, Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR) are in a promising position. With three events remaining, the trio, driving the #31 BMW M4 GT3, holds third place in the driver standings. Valentino Rossi (ITA) brings a wealth of two-wheel-experience at COTA from his time as a MotoGP rider. Together with Maxime Martin (BEL) and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 he will now race on four wheels in Austin.\n\nThe Lone Star Le Mans in Austin kicks off on Sunday, 1st September, at 20:00 CEST (13:00 local time).\n\nOn Friday, at 10:30 local time in the paddock, there will be a ‘Meet the Team’ event with all drivers, Head of BMW M Motorsport Andreas Roos, and WRT Team Principal Vincent Vosse. All accredited media representatives are invited.\n\nThe latest episode of the video documentary \"Mbedded\" draws a very personal and emotional portrait of Augusto Farfus, his racing history, his charitable work, and his family. The episode is now available to watch on BMW M YouTube: b.mw/Mbedded_Farfus.\n\nQuotes before the Lone Star Le Mans in Austin:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The Circuit of The Americas is a fascinating track with a layout that gives it a very different character compared to Interlagos. Since we weren’t able to show the speed we had hoped for in Brazil, we are determined to get back on track in Texas. Our goal with the Hypercars is to demonstrate a clear upward trend and translate the lessons learned from the season so far into strong results. In the LMGT3 class, the fight for the world championship title and podium finishes at COTA remain our objective.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “In the Hypercar class, we have some targets. Let’s hope that we make some steps and be back where we want to be. The goal will be to fight inside the top five. We have been testing in Austin and I think this will help us. In the LMGT3 class, we haven’t been competitive in the last race at São Paulo so it’s important to fight back. We need to get some points and we are going to push hard for that. We still have three more races to go starting with Austin. We expect to be there and we will do everything to fight back in the championship.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8): “After a longer break, we’re back in action in the FIA WEC at COTA. I’m really looking forward to it, and it’s a track I’m personally familiar with. I first drove the BMW M Hybrid V8 there about two years ago, and we also had a test there a few weeks ago. So, it’s not completely new territory for me. The facility is really cool, and the track itself offers a great mix with many fast corners in sector one and the winding, technical sectors two and three. I hope we can deliver a strong performance, take another step forward, and build on the positive race weekend we had with our #15 in Brazil.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8): “It’s Austin up next, a track I’ve never been before so I’m definitely looking forward to going to Texas and driving at COTA for the very first time. The team was there testing a few weeks ago so I believe that we can hit the ground running at the race weekend with set-up options and I believe the homework has been done between São Paulo and now. So I really feel that we are set up well for a good race weekend. We owe the team so much for all the hard work they have done. So I am hoping that we can order in the top five, I think that should be the goal.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3): “We’re going to COTA, a new ground for me. It’s my first time there so there is a lot to learn. We are getting closer to the end of the season, there are only three rounds left, and we need to give it all. Interlagos has been a difficult race for us, and now we need to close the gap to the front runners in the standings to try to have a shot on the championship. I love the US, I think that we have shown a strong performance in most of the races, we have everything to win and nothing to lose, and we will go maximum.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3): „After the summer break, we start with the WEC race in Austin. I am very happy to go back there because it is a fantastic track and I raced there a lot of times in MotoGP. The last time was in 2021, so it’s good to be back. The track is very interesting, with the MotoGP bike it’s great. I think that it will be great fun also with the BMW M4 GT3. We try to be competitive, try to understand our pace and I cannot wait to see the team, my car and my team-mates Maxime and Ahmad to try to do the maximum.“"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Texas, Austin, COTA: A spectacular racetrack will host the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) this coming weekend (30th August to 1st September).

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nMunich. With the introduction of the new models, MINI is describing the performance levels of its gasoline engines for the MINI Countryman with C and, as a more powerful model, with S. A diesel variant is also available. With the MINI Countryman C, the brand combines a high level of driving comfort and spacious room with an efficient 3-cylinder gasoline engine.\n\n“As an entry-level model, the MINI Countryman C combines typical MINI features such as agility and driving pleasure with generous standard equipment,” says Stefanie Wurst, head of the MINI brand.\n\nThe exterior: puristic design with increased presence.\n\nThe new MINI Countryman is 13 centimeters longer and eight centimeters higher than its predecessor. The upright silhouette with clearly designed surfaces and the redesigned octagonal front grille contribute to the model's superior appearance. The reduced body design with delicate contours gives the model a sleek appearance. Typical of the brand, short overhangs underline the agile vehicle character. Distinctive LED headlights and rear lights accentuate the body design with optional new light signatures.\n\nThe stylish, concisely designed C-pillar adjoins the stretched vehicle roof flush and in the same colour. Piano Black roof rails are now standard equipment and maximize the transport options of the crossover model, for example with a roof rack or the MINI roof box.\n\nOn uneven roads, 202 mm ground clearance and the dynamic chassis provide additional safety and comfort. For the new MINI Countryman C, light-alloy wheels are available in various designs and sizes ranging from 17 to 21 inches.\n\nThe interior: spacious and versatile with typical MINI comfort.\n\nThe spacious interior of the new MINI Countryman can accommodate up to five adults. With a panoramic glass roof, the interior has additional brightness and all-round visibility. The standard sports seats with patterned multi-tone textile in the cockpit give passengers more space thanks to an additional width of three centimetres in the shoulder and elbow area. The backrest of the three rear seats can be individually adjusted in six positions by up to 12° degrees. The back seat, which can be moved up to 13 cm, creates additional legroom in the rear or even more cargo space. Thanks to the rear seat backrest, which can be folded down at a ratio of 40:20:40, the trunk volume of 450 litres to 1460 litres can be easily and flexibly adapted to personal needs.\n\nAt the centre of the minimalistic interior design is the round OLED display with a diameter of 240 mm. The new central instrument with a high-quality glass surface allows all infotainment and assistance systems to be operated conveniently and intuitively via touch or voice command. The MINI Experience Modes change the appearance of the cockpit with a combination of visual design, ambient lighting and sound design. All driving functions can be controlled via the characteristic MINI toggle bar.\n\nFor the first time, Driving Assistant Plus expands the MINI Countryman with the option of partially automated Level 2 driving on motorway-like routes. This allows the driver to take his hands off the steering wheel up to a speed of 60 km/h, provided that he continues to closely monitor the traffic and remains ready to intervene at any time.\n\nFour trim options for individual expression.\n\nThe product structure of the new MINI Family offers a wide range of customization options with the new Essential, Classic, Favoured and JCW trim variants. Depending on the trim, different paint and roof colours as well as various interior finishes are available. The design of the new C-pillar element changes with the selected vehicle trim.\n\nThe particularly expressive Favoured trim, with the contrasting roof and the Vibrant Silver front grille frame, sets stylish accents to the Smokey Green body colour. 20-inch rims in the aerodynamically optimised Windmill Spoke 2-tone design accentuate the self-confident appearance of the MINI Countryman C.\n\nIn the interior, a two-tone colour gradient adorns the textile surface from the dashboard to the door panels.

The upright silhouette with clearly designed surfaces and the redesigned octagonal front grille contribute to the model's superior appearance.

The two-door model is now even more attractive thanks to a detailed, modified design, extended standard equipment and consistent digitalisation. All model variants of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé come with the M Sport Package and additional comfort features as standard. New paint finishes, light-alloy wheels, steering wheels, trim strips and seat upholstery add a modern touch to the exterior and interior of the vehicle. The new BMW iDrive with QuickSelect and innovative digital services based on the BMW Operating System 8.5 also contribute to the progressive character of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé.\n\nThe new BMW 2 Series Coupé will be launched on the market in August 2024. It will be manufactured at the BMW Group plant in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, where the new BMW 3 Series Sedan with combustion engine and plug-in hybrid drive is also built. The plant, which was opened in 2019, features particularly efficient and sustainable production processes.\n\nFresh design highlights, M Sport Package now standard.\n\nThe dimensions, body structure, drive concept and chassis technology of the BMW 2 Series Coupé are designed to convey the brand's hallmark driving pleasure in a particularly concentrated form. The distinctive front end with individual round headlamps, the horizontal BMW radiator grille and the power dome on the long bonnet, the athletically modelled surfaces of the side view, the wide wheel arches and the short luggage compartment lid that ends in a striking air scoop give the BMW 2 Series Coupé an unmistakable appearance. With the design features of the M Sport Package now fitted as standard, the new edition of the compact two-door model expresses its dynamic character even more intensively. The M specific design includes extra-large air intakes at the front of the vehicle, powerful side skirts and a striking rear apron with vertical reflectors and a diffuser-like insert.\n\nAt the front of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé, the surround of the BMW radiator grille is now finished in pearlescent chrome. The side skirts and the lower part of the rear apron are no longer painted in black, but in the colour of the vehicle. The diffuser insert is finished in high-gloss black for a contrasting effect at the rear.\n\nThe BMW M240i xDrive Coupé has its own version of the M specific design features. These optimise the cooling air supply and aerodynamic balance. They include the high-gloss black inserts for the side air intakes, the black spoiler lip on the front apron, the model-specific rear spoiler and the trapezoidal tailpipes on the left and right of the rear apron.

The rear roof line, the high centre console and the harmoniously blended surfaces of the instrument panel and door panels create an enveloping feeling of space. This is further enhanced by the anthracite-coloured headlining, part of the M Sport Package.\n\nThe interior modifications also focus on digitalisation. The BMW Curved Display plays an increasingly important role in the intuitive operation of the vehicle's functions. The fully digital display system comprises a 12.3-inch Information Display and a 14.9-inch Control Display. It serves as a platform for the further developed BMW iDrive with QuickSelect based on the BMW Operating System 8.5.

At the same time, the SPORT driving experience mode is activated with the appropriate settings for all drive and suspension systems. This mode change is now also visualised by the corresponding graphics on the Information Display.\n\nThe M Sport suspension, which is fitted as standard in the four-cylinder models of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé, provides a noticeable increase in agility and cornering dynamics with its firm suspension set-up and stroke-dependent shock absorbers.

The rear roof line, the high centre console and the harmoniously blended surfaces of the instrument panel and door panels create an enveloping feeling of space. This is further enhanced by the anthracite-coloured headlining, part of the M Sport Package.\n\nThe interior modifications also focus on digitalisation. The BMW Curved Display plays an increasingly important role in the intuitive operation of the vehicle's functions. The fully digital display system comprises a 12.3-inch Information Display and a 14.9-inch Control Display. It serves as a platform for the further developed BMW iDrive with QuickSelect based on the BMW Operating System 8.5. This means that the automatic air condition functions and, if fitted, the seat and steering wheel heating can be operated by touch on the Control Display or by voice command. This is accompanied by a further reduction in the number of buttons and controls in the cockpit and a corresponding redesign of the instrument panel.

On the driver's side, widgets are displayed at the same level in a vertical bar and can be selected directly using the QuickSelect shortcut without having to switch to a submenu. The new, flat menu structure makes it much easier to navigate between the various functions and helps the driver of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé to concentrate on the traffic situation.\n\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant can now be operated in Swedish, Polish and Dutch. There is now a choice of two visualisations for the digital companion on the Control Display. Additional graphic symbols are also displayed there in response to selected voice commands.\n\nThe BMW Maps navigation system, which comes as standard in the new BMW 2 Series Coupé as part of the BMW Live Cockpit Plus, is based on the BMW Operating System 8.5 and offers even easier destination entry, additional information while driving and further optimisations for fast and precise route guidance.

BMW is the first carmaker in the world to receive approval for a combination of a Level 2 driving assistance system (the BMW Highway Assistant) and a Level 3 system in the form of the BMW Personal Pilot L3 in the same vehicle. The new BMW 7 Series therefore sets a milestone in the field of automated driving by offering a unique opportunity to enjoy the benefits of both systems in the same car. BMW Highway Assistant (Level 2): greater comfort on long journeys.This advanced Level 2 feature enhances comfort significantly on long-distance journeys especially thanks to its ability to operate at speeds up to 130 km/h (81 mph). The BMW Highway Assistant is an additional function of the Steering and Lane Control Assistant that can be used on motorways with structurally separated carriageways. On such stretches of road, the driver is able to take their hands off the steering wheel for longer periods and position them comfortably, provided they continue to pay attention to what is happening on the road and are able to take over the steering again at any time. While driving in partially automated mode, the BMW 7 Series Sedan is also able to make lane changes without the driver having to take hold of the steering wheel again. This is made possible by the Active Lane Change Assistant, which performs the necessary steering movements for the overtaking manoeuvre and adjusts the vehicle’s speed as required as soon as the traffic situation permits. Plus, the driver is able to initiate a lane change suggested by this system by simply looking in the exterior mirror to confirm it. BMW Personal Pilot (Level 3): allowing other in-car activities in traffic jams.Highly automated Level 3 driving means drivers can take their hands off the steering wheel and temporarily turn their attention away from the road. The BMW Personal Pilot L3 feature in the 7 Series offers a whole new driving experience by enabling drivers to fully delegate the task of driving to their car under certain conditions at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph) and look away from the road. Highly automated systems are capable of completely taking over the driving in specific situations, e.g. in traffic jams on the motorway. This even lets drivers carry out other in-car activities, such as making phone calls, reading, writing messages, working or streaming videos. However, the driver must always be prepared to reassume control within a few seconds when prompted by the car, for example when there are roadworks. The combination of all these driving assistance systems within a single vehicle represents a significant advance and offers a comprehensive set of functionalities for a more comfortable, more relaxing drive over both long and short journeys. “We are setting new standards in the automotive industry by combining both technologies in the new BMW 7 Series,” says Dr. Mihiar Ayoubi, Senior Vice President Driving Experience BMW Group. “In the process, we are underlining our commitment to offering our customers a safe, comfortable and innovative driving experience.” The BMW Highway Assistant and Driving Assistant Professional are both part of the optional BMW Personal Pilot L3, which is available exclusively in Germany priced at € 6,000 (incl.

Victory for BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER)! In front of a record crowd in the \"Green Hell\", Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) crowned an outstanding comeback with BMW's 21st overall victory at the endurance classic on the Nordschleife. Additionally, the new BMW M2 Racing impressed as in its final endurance test, the new entry-level race car – fielded by Team FK Performance Motorsport – celebrated a class victory.\n\nROWE Racing had a challenging start to the weekend in the Eifel region. After the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO missed out on the top qualifying session, the BMW M works driver quartet started the race from 17th position. However, under perfect weather conditions, Farfus made a dream start, moving into the top ten within the first lap. After an hour and a half, a power outage in the paddock caused a red flag. Following a 2-hour and 15-minute interruption, van der Linde stormed through the field during the restart, advancing the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from ninth to third in just two laps.\n\nSubsequently, Marciello and Krohn solidified their positions in the podium ranks, with ROWE Racing navigating the night flawlessly and steadily in second place, building a comfortable gap to the cars behind. As the sun rose over the Nordschleife, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO closed a gap of over two minutes to the leader. By the morning, the race turned into a true thriller in the \"Green Hell\". Three and a half hours before the finish, Farfus claimed the lead for ROWE Racing for the first time.\n\nAfter a penalty was issued to the competing #911 Porsche, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO was firmly on course for victory, which van der Linde secured after 24 hours. Although he crossed the finish line behind the Porsche, the Manthey EMA team's appeal against the penalty was dismissed, ensuring ROWE Racing's victory. For van der Linde, this marked his third triumph at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring after wins in 2017 and 2022 – his first with BMW M Motorsport. Alongside Farfus and his brother Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), the 29-year-old had also won the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge at Bathurst, Australia. That series includes the 24h Nürburgring as well as the upcoming 24h Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) next weekend.\n\nFor Farfus, it was his second victory on the Nordschleife after a 15-year wait, while Marciello celebrated his first 24h-race win for BMW M Motorsport in front of a record crowd of 280,000 spectators. For Krohn, it was also his first victory at the 24h Nürburgring. BMW, the record champions at the Nürburgring, last triumphed five years ago. In 2020, the BMW M6 GT3, also fielded by ROWE Racing, claimed victory.\n\nImpressive class victory for the BMW M2 Racing. The new BMW M2 Racing also delivered an outstanding performance. BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER), Charles Weerts, and Ugo de Wilde (BEL), along with motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER), were unbeatable in the SP 3T class with the #310 car. It marked a perfect final endurance test before the sales phase begins for the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car.\n\nIn total, BMW M Motorsport customer teams achieved seven class victories at the 24h Nürburgring. The #67 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from AV Racing by Black Falcon triumphed in the SP10 class. Additional successes included the #650 BMW M240i Racing from Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels in the BMW M240i class, the #500 BMW 330i from the same team in the VT2 rear-wheel-drive class, the #700 BMW 325i from rent2Drive-racing in its respective class, and the #277 BMW 318ti from RAVENOL Motorsport by MDM Racing in the SP3 class.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"I am absolutely thrilled for ROWE Racing and the drivers on this 21st overall victory for BMW at the 24h Nürburgring. This time, we could only compete with one car in the top class, but as we’ve seen, when the team and drivers deliver a perfect performance, the 'Green Hell' can be forgiving. In recent years, it hasn’t always been on our side, but this time, after 2020, we finally managed to secure another victory. Congratulations to everyone involved! The race of our new BMW M2 Racing was also sensational, achieving an impressive class victory right out of the gate. What an outstanding performance by the team and drivers!\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"What an incredible 24-hour race! Although we only competed with one car, we had a fantastic team and amazing drivers. ROWE Racing, along with Augusto Farfus, Jesse Krohn, Raffaele Marciello, and Kelvin van der Linde, delivered an absolutely flawless and perfect performance. Congratulations and a big thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport who worked so hard for this success. The performance of our new family member, the BMW M2 Racing, was also inspiring, with Ugo de Wilde, Jens Klingmann, Charles Weerts, and Michael Bräutigam celebrating a class victory. Congratulations to the FK Performance Motorsport team and to all teams and drivers who celebrated class wins and podiums in their BMW vehicles today! I am very proud!\"\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal, ROWE Racing): \"I am incredibly happy and proud of my team and drivers. I still can’t quite believe it. The race was exciting on so many levels. If someone had told me on Thursday that we’d be standing here as winners on Sunday, I wouldn’t have believed them. At that point, we were dealing with completely different problems. To work through those and hold our ground in such a tough and hot race was a fantastic achievement by everyone. This success is good for everyone and hopefully a good omen for the race at Spa-Francorchamps next week.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I had the privilege of driving the formation lap and seeing all these fans. This place is magical. We are blessed to be part of this show and to race in front of these people. I celebrated my first major victory for BMW M Motorsport here 15 years ago, and to stand here again is something special – and with the only BMW M4 GT3 EVO. We came here with just one car, but in the end, we represented BMW in the best possible way. Our goal was to finish the race, and in the end, we did so as winners. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing for the trust. Bringing this trophy home is also a big reward for the people in Munich.\"\n\nJesse Krohn (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am just grateful: grateful to BMW M Motorsport, ROWE Racing, my teammates, and the fans. This is such a special day. I’ve been coming here for over ten years, and finally, everything came together. There are moments when you feel like it will never happen, but now we’ve done it. You just need the right people around you, and we had that today. I’m just thankful to be here and to experience this moment.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am very happy. The 24 Hours of Nürburgring is one of the races I’ve always wanted to win. I’m glad that this dream has finally come true. Among the three 24-hour races this June, this was my main goal. Achieving this victory makes me incredibly proud. My teammates did a fantastic job.

Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing for the trust. It was an extreme race. The entire team worked flawlessly. Everyone was at their limit: the car, us, and the tyres at the end. It was one of the toughest 24-hour races I’ve experienced here, and I am very, very proud.\"\n\nUgo de Wilde (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"It was a fantastic weekend for me: my first 24 hours on the Nordschleife. The main goal was to gain experience and show that the car is reliable. We achieved that. The car was very good, very reliable, very consistent, and it was fun to drive. It was a fantastic experience to drive at night and to spend these days with the great team and my amazing teammates. We had a great atmosphere, and it was a joy to work with them. Huge congratulations to BMW M Motorsport, ROWE Racing, and all the drivers – especially my GT World Challenge teammate Kelvin – on the overall victory.\"\n\nJens Klingmann (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"We are super happy. We completed the 24h Nürburgring, the dress rehearsal, the ultimate endurance test, without any issues.

With P36 in the overall standings and the class victory, we’ve clearly demonstrated that. We are incredibly happy; the car ran flawlessly and looks the same after the final lap as it did after the first. And of course, we are very happy about the overall victory for BMW M Motorsport and that the trophy is heading back to Munich.\"\n\nCharles Weerts (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"It was a very good race for both the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M2 Racing. The car performed very well. Our primary goal was to finish the race – and then to be as successful as possible. And we achieved that. Michael, Ugo, Jens, and the entire team did a fantastic job. It’s great to see that the project worked so well. If the car survives the 24 hours at the Nürburgring, it’s a very successful test for the car. I’m very happy for BMW M Motorsport, and of course, congratulations to ROWE Racing on the overall victory with the #98.\"\n\nMichael Bräutigam (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"My weekend was filled with many emotions.

Victory for BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER)! In front of a record crowd in the \"Green Hell\", Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) crowned an outstanding comeback with BMW's 21st overall victory at the endurance classic on the Nordschleife. Additionally, the new BMW M2 Racing impressed as in its final endurance test, the new entry-level race car – fielded by Team FK Performance Motorsport – celebrated a class victory.\n\nROWE Racing had a challenging start to the weekend in the Eifel region. After the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO missed out on the top qualifying session, the BMW M works driver quartet started the race from 17th position. However, under perfect weather conditions, Farfus made a dream start, moving into the top ten within the first lap. After an hour and a half, a power outage in the paddock caused a red flag. Following a 2-hour and 15-minute interruption, van der Linde stormed through the field during the restart, advancing the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from ninth to third in just two laps.\n\nSubsequently, Marciello and Krohn solidified their positions in the podium ranks, with ROWE Racing navigating the night flawlessly and steadily in second place, building a comfortable gap to the cars behind. As the sun rose over the Nordschleife, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO closed a gap of over two minutes to the leader. By the morning, the race turned into a true thriller in the \"Green Hell\". Three and a half hours before the finish, Farfus claimed the lead for ROWE Racing for the first time.\n\nAfter a penalty was issued to the competing #911 Porsche, the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO was firmly on course for victory, which van der Linde secured after 24 hours. Although he crossed the finish line behind the Porsche, the Manthey EMA team's appeal against the penalty was dismissed, ensuring ROWE Racing's victory. For van der Linde, this marked his third triumph at the 24 Hours of Nürburgring after wins in 2017 and 2022 – his first with BMW M Motorsport. Alongside Farfus and his brother Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), the 29-year-old had also won the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge at Bathurst, Australia. That series includes the 24h Nürburgring as well as the upcoming 24h Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) next weekend.\n\nFor Farfus, it was his second victory on the Nordschleife after a 15-year wait, while Marciello celebrated his first 24h-race win for BMW M Motorsport in front of a record crowd of 280,000 spectators. For Krohn, it was also his first victory at the 24h Nürburgring. BMW, the record champions at the Nürburgring, last triumphed five years ago. In 2020, the BMW M6 GT3, also fielded by ROWE Racing, claimed victory.\n\nImpressive class victory for the BMW M2 Racing. The new BMW M2 Racing also delivered an outstanding performance. BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER), Charles Weerts, and Ugo de Wilde (BEL), along with motorsport journalist Michael Bräutigam (GER), were unbeatable in the SP 3T class with the #310 car. It marked a perfect final endurance test before the sales phase begins for the new BMW M Motorsport entry-level race car.\n\nIn total, BMW M Motorsport customer teams achieved seven class victories at the 24h Nürburgring. The #67 BMW M4 GT4 EVO from AV Racing by Black Falcon triumphed in the SP10 class. Additional successes included the #650 BMW M240i Racing from Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels in the BMW M240i class, the #500 BMW 330i from the same team in the VT2 rear-wheel-drive class, the #700 BMW 325i from rent2Drive-racing in its respective class, and the #277 BMW 318ti from RAVENOL Motorsport by MDM Racing in the SP3 class.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"I am absolutely thrilled for ROWE Racing and the drivers on this 21st overall victory for BMW at the 24h Nürburgring. This time, we could only compete with one car in the top class, but as we’ve seen, when the team and drivers deliver a perfect performance, the 'Green Hell' can be forgiving. In recent years, it hasn’t always been on our side, but this time, after 2020, we finally managed to secure another victory. Congratulations to everyone involved! The race of our new BMW M2 Racing was also sensational, achieving an impressive class victory right out of the gate.

Additional successes included the #650 BMW M240i Racing from Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels in the BMW M240i class, the #500 BMW 330i from the same team in the VT2 rear-wheel-drive class, the #700 BMW 325i from rent2Drive-racing in its respective class, and the #277 BMW 318ti from RAVENOL Motorsport by MDM Racing in the SP3 class.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"I am absolutely thrilled for ROWE Racing and the drivers on this 21st overall victory for BMW at the 24h Nürburgring. This time, we could only compete with one car in the top class, but as we’ve seen, when the team and drivers deliver a perfect performance, the 'Green Hell' can be forgiving. In recent years, it hasn’t always been on our side, but this time, after 2020, we finally managed to secure another victory. Congratulations to everyone involved! The race of our new BMW M2 Racing was also sensational, achieving an impressive class victory right out of the gate. What an outstanding performance by the team and drivers!\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"What an incredible 24-hour race! Although we only competed with one car, we had a fantastic team and amazing drivers. ROWE Racing, along with Augusto Farfus, Jesse Krohn, Raffaele Marciello, and Kelvin van der Linde, delivered an absolutely flawless and perfect performance. Congratulations and a big thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport who worked so hard for this success. The performance of our new family member, the BMW M2 Racing, was also inspiring, with Ugo de Wilde, Jens Klingmann, Charles Weerts, and Michael Bräutigam celebrating a class victory. Congratulations to the FK Performance Motorsport team and to all teams and drivers who celebrated class wins and podiums in their BMW vehicles today! I am very proud!\"\n\nHans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal, ROWE Racing): \"I am incredibly happy and proud of my team and drivers. I still can’t quite believe it. The race was exciting on so many levels. If someone had told me on Thursday that we’d be standing here as winners on Sunday, I wouldn’t have believed them. At that point, we were dealing with completely different problems. To work through those and hold our ground in such a tough and hot race was a fantastic achievement by everyone. This success is good for everyone and hopefully a good omen for the race at Spa-Francorchamps next week.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I had the privilege of driving the formation lap and seeing all these fans. This place is magical. We are blessed to be part of this show and to race in front of these people. I celebrated my first major victory for BMW M Motorsport here 15 years ago, and to stand here again is something special – and with the only BMW M4 GT3 EVO. We came here with just one car, but in the end, we represented BMW in the best possible way. Our goal was to finish the race, and in the end, we did so as winners. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing for the trust. Bringing this trophy home is also a big reward for the people in Munich.\"\n\nJesse Krohn (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am just grateful: grateful to BMW M Motorsport, ROWE Racing, my teammates, and the fans. This is such a special day. I’ve been coming here for over ten years, and finally, everything came together. There are moments when you feel like it will never happen, but now we’ve done it. You just need the right people around you, and we had that today. I’m just thankful to be here and to experience this moment.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"I am very happy. The 24 Hours of Nürburgring is one of the races I’ve always wanted to win. I’m glad that this dream has finally come true. Among the three 24-hour races this June, this was my main goal. Achieving this victory makes me incredibly proud. My teammates did a fantastic job. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing.\"\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, Winner): \"It’s always a privilege. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport and ROWE Racing for the trust. It was an extreme race. The entire team worked flawlessly. Everyone was at their limit: the car, us, and the tyres at the end. It was one of the toughest 24-hour races I’ve experienced here, and I am very, very proud.\"\n\nUgo de Wilde (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"It was a fantastic weekend for me: my first 24 hours on the Nordschleife. The main goal was to gain experience and show that the car is reliable. We achieved that. The car was very good, very reliable, very consistent, and it was fun to drive. It was a fantastic experience to drive at night and to spend these days with the great team and my amazing teammates. We had a great atmosphere, and it was a joy to work with them. Huge congratulations to BMW M Motorsport, ROWE Racing, and all the drivers – especially my GT World Challenge teammate Kelvin – on the overall victory.\"\n\nJens Klingmann (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"We are super happy. We completed the 24h Nürburgring, the dress rehearsal, the ultimate endurance test, without any issues. That makes us very proud and confident that we can deliver a proven race car that also has strong performance. With P36 in the overall standings and the class victory, we’ve clearly demonstrated that. We are incredibly happy; the car ran flawlessly and looks the same after the final lap as it did after the first. And of course, we are very happy about the overall victory for BMW M Motorsport and that the trophy is heading back to Munich.\"\n\nCharles Weerts (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"It was a very good race for both the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and the BMW M2 Racing. The car performed very well. Our primary goal was to finish the race – and then to be as successful as possible. And we achieved that. Michael, Ugo, Jens, and the entire team did a fantastic job. It’s great to see that the project worked so well. If the car survives the 24 hours at the Nürburgring, it’s a very successful test for the car. I’m very happy for BMW M Motorsport, and of course, congratulations to ROWE Racing on the overall victory with the #98.\"\n\nMichael Bräutigam (#310 BMW M2 Racing, FK Performance Motorsport, 1st Place SP 3T Class): \"My weekend was filled with many emotions. First and foremost, I was incredibly proud to even be part of this project and to drive and get to know a car that no one outside the BMW family had seen before. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport for that! Since I’m from the Eifel, this race – especially in front of a record crowd – is an absolute highlight for me. I’m very happy with the result and my performance.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Great results for BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT at the second round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). The 6 Hours of Imola (ITA) ended with a one-two result for the BMW M4 GT3 in the LMGT3 class. Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR) triumphed ahead of their team-mates Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA). It was the first victory for a BMW M Motorsport car in the history of the FIA WEC. BMW M Team WRT also celebrated success in the Hypercar category. After a challenging start in Qatar, Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) gave a very strong performance, battled for the podium for a long time, and ultimately finished in sixth place.\n\nThe weather conditions, with rain setting in around the halfway point of the race, turned the event into a strategy gamble. However, all BMW M Motorsport teams made the right tyre choices and were rewarded with outstanding results. The BMW M Hybrid V8 made enormous improvements compared to the season opener and was competitive under all conditions. On the wet track, final driver van der Linde even had the podium within reach, but problems during the last pit stop and a subsequent drive-through penalty pushed the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 back to a still-strong sixth place. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 with Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) in the cockpit was unlucky and got innocently involved in a collision at the start. After about an hour of repairs, the team managed to get the car back on track for important test kilometres.\n\nThe celebration was even greater in the LMGT3 category. Both BMW M4 GT3 crews continued on slick tyres as the rain began to fall, making the right decision. No competitor could match their speed, and they drove to a commanding one-two finish. Never before had a BMW M Motorsport car won a race in this series since the founding of the FIA WEC in 2012.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “That was an extremely positive FIA WEC event at Imola. In Hypercar, we made great progress after the challenging start in Qatar. We had the pace to achieve a top result on our own. I am pleased that car #20 was able to hold its own in the leading group throughout the race, even under difficult conditions. The early unprovoked accident of car #15 was very unfortunate and annoying. Many thanks to BMW M Team WRT, which rebuilt the car and sent it back on track. That allowed us to finish the race and collect important data to continue improving. On the LMGT3 side of the garage, it couldn't have gone better. Congratulations to all drivers and crew members for very strong performances. Thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and the team for a very successful weekend!”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “What a great weekend for our LMGT3 crews! Qualifying and the race went very well, and we did the little things right. Augusto and Maxime stayed on slicks on a wet track and were able to show incredible pace. That gave us a good lead and ultimately the one-two result. In Hypercar we were in the window where we belong this time after the big disappointment in Qatar. We are taking one step at a time and have already done some things very well here. On to the next race at Spa-Francorchamps.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 6th place): “In the end, that was one of the most challenging and craziest stints I've ever driven. I thought several times that I would lose the car. I knew I had to bring it home so we could score very good points. Luckily, that worked out. The team did a great job improving the car so much since Qatar. We can be very proud of that. Thank you to everyone!”\n\nMarco Wittmann (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 18th place): “That was a wild start phase, where some of our competitors quite misjudged themselves. I was hit from behind and spun around. That was very annoying. The guys did a great job repairing the car and getting us back on track. That allowed us to collect important test kilometres. My stint after the repair was great. The car felt good, and we could have made up some places. The pace and balance were good; we need to build on that. Hopefully, we'll have more racing luck next time.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “I am incredibly happy and proud. We showed today that it's about having the best team in this championship, not just the best car or the best individual driver. In my stint, the track was always differently wet, and it was a constant question of which tyres were better. We stayed on slicks the whole time, and I felt very comfortable in the BMW M4 GT3 under those conditions. The team always stayed calm and did everything right in the end. It's my son's birthday today – I couldn't have given him a better gift.”\n\nSean Gelael (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “I'm super happy! Darren qualified the car in fourth place on Saturday and drove a strong first stint. I had quite a bit of fun after that and was able to make up some time. Then I handed over to Augusto, who was sensational on the track and put pressure on Maxime. It was not so bad today.”\n\nDarren Leung (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “Winning in just my second FIA WEC race – that's just incredible! We did an outstanding job as a team. The turbulent start phase was difficult for me, but I got through it very well and was able to hand over the car in a good position to my colleagues.”\n\nMaxime Martin (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “A fantastic result for the team. We had a strong car and decided on a bold strategy. That made the difference in the end. Congratulations to the #31 crew on the victory! We collected a lot of points and will continue to work hard in the next races.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “I am very happy about the one-two for Team WRT, for BMW M Motorsport, and my first podium in FIA WEC. We already had a strong car on Saturday in qualifying, and Ahmad achieved a very good third starting position. In the race, we then decided to stay out on slicks. Augusto was a bit faster than Maxime at the beginning and took the lead. Nevertheless, I am very happy with the result.”\n\nAhmad Al Harthy (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “My first podium with Team WRT – that's an incredible feeling! Many thanks to the team, which did a fantastic job. We took a calculated risk, and it paid off in the end.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great results for BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT at the second round of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC).

In Hypercar, we made great progress after the challenging start in Qatar. We had the pace to achieve a top result on our own. I am pleased that car #20 was able to hold its own in the leading group throughout the race, even under difficult conditions. The early unprovoked accident of car #15 was very unfortunate and annoying. Many thanks to BMW M Team WRT, which rebuilt the car and sent it back on track. That allowed us to finish the race and collect important data to continue improving. On the LMGT3 side of the garage, it couldn't have gone better. Congratulations to all drivers and crew members for very strong performances. Thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and the team for a very successful weekend!”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “What a great weekend for our LMGT3 crews! Qualifying and the race went very well, and we did the little things right. Augusto and Maxime stayed on slicks on a wet track and were able to show incredible pace. That gave us a good lead and ultimately the one-two result. In Hypercar we were in the window where we belong this time after the big disappointment in Qatar. We are taking one step at a time and have already done some things very well here. On to the next race at Spa-Francorchamps.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 6th place): “In the end, that was one of the most challenging and craziest stints I've ever driven. I thought several times that I would lose the car. I knew I had to bring it home so we could score very good points. Luckily, that worked out. The team did a great job improving the car so much since Qatar. We can be very proud of that. Thank you to everyone!”\n\nMarco Wittmann (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 18th place): “That was a wild start phase, where some of our competitors quite misjudged themselves. I was hit from behind and spun around. That was very annoying. The guys did a great job repairing the car and getting us back on track. That allowed us to collect important test kilometres. My stint after the repair was great. The car felt good, and we could have made up some places. The pace and balance were good; we need to build on that. Hopefully, we'll have more racing luck next time.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “I am incredibly happy and proud. We showed today that it's about having the best team in this championship, not just the best car or the best individual driver. In my stint, the track was always differently wet, and it was a constant question of which tyres were better. We stayed on slicks the whole time, and I felt very comfortable in the BMW M4 GT3 under those conditions. The team always stayed calm and did everything right in the end. It's my son's birthday today – I couldn't have given him a better gift.”\n\nSean Gelael (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “I'm super happy! Darren qualified the car in fourth place on Saturday and drove a strong first stint. I had quite a bit of fun after that and was able to make up some time. Then I handed over to Augusto, who was sensational on the track and put pressure on Maxime. It was not so bad today.”\n\nDarren Leung (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place): “Winning in just my second FIA WEC race – that's just incredible! We did an outstanding job as a team. The turbulent start phase was difficult for me, but I got through it very well and was able to hand over the car in a good position to my colleagues.”\n\nMaxime Martin (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “A fantastic result for the team. We had a strong car and decided on a bold strategy. That made the difference in the end. Congratulations to the #31 crew on the victory! We collected a lot of points and will continue to work hard in the next races.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “I am very happy about the one-two for Team WRT, for BMW M Motorsport, and my first podium in FIA WEC. We already had a strong car on Saturday in qualifying, and Ahmad achieved a very good third starting position. In the race, we then decided to stay out on slicks. Augusto was a bit faster than Maxime at the beginning and took the lead. Nevertheless, I am very happy with the result.”\n\nAhmad Al Harthy (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place): “My first podium with Team WRT – that's an incredible feeling! Many thanks to the team, which did a fantastic job. We took a calculated risk, and it paid off in the end.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The winner of the 2025 BMW M Award in MotoGP™ is Marc Márquez. The record holder in this special competition has once again claimed the coveted prize for the fastest qualifier of the season – for the eighth time. The Spaniard had already made history by winning the BMW M Award seven years in a row between 2013 and 2019. Now Márquez has returned to the top. His prize this year is the new BMW M2 CS (combined fuel consumption: 10.0 l/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G)*. The presentation of the winner’s car took place on Saturday after the final qualifying session of the season at Valencia, Spain, where Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports, and Axel Mittler, Marketing Manager at BMW M GmbH, handed over the keys.\n\nAfter several challenging years, Márquez made an impressive comeback in 2025. He dominated the season and clinched the world championship title early, already in Japan at the 17th of 22 rounds. In the BMW M Award standings, Márquez collected so many points – with eight pole positions and five additional front-row starts – that he could no longer be caught, even though he missed the final four rounds of the season due to injury. Márquez won the 2025 BMW M Award with 351 points, finishing eight points ahead of his brother Álex Márquez in second place. As in the races, MotoGP™ riders receive points for the BMW M Award according to their qualifying positions. The winner at the end of the season is awarded an exclusive high-performance automobile from BMW M. This coveted award has been presented every year since 2003.\n\nCarmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna Sports, said: “Congratulations to Marc Márquez. He has made an impressive comeback this season and once again demonstrated why he is one of the greatest MotoGP riders of all time. From 2013 onwards, we handed him the keys to a new BMW M car seven times in a row at the season finale – and I am delighted that we can do so again this year. His performance and talent have been outstanding, and he truly deserves the BMW M Award this season. At the same time, my thanks go to BMW M GmbH. For 22 years now, the BMW M Award has been an integral part of MotoGP, making it a genuine tradition. It’s a special recognition of what our riders and their teams achieve weekend after weekend in qualifying.”\n\nAxel Mittler added: “What Marc Márquez has shown this season was simply incredible. Congratulations to our record winner: seven consecutive victories were already historic, but his eighth BMW M Award triumph is truly remarkable, especially considering that he built such a big lead in the standings that even his injury couldn’t stop him from winning. We are delighted to add our new BMW M2 CS to Marc’s collection of BMW M Award winners’ cars. This high-performance sports car once again raises the benchmark in its segment, and with its pure performance, dynamics, and agility, it’s the perfect winner’s car for the currently world’s best MotoGP rider. We wish Marc lots of fun with his prize – and a smooth recovery, so that he can thrill us again next season!”\n\nMarc Márquez said: “It took a few years, but I’m really happy to see my name back on the list of BMW M Award winners. This season has been a dream for me, even though I obviously didn’t imagine it ending with a shoulder injury that made me miss the final races. But it’s great to be here in Valencia and to be recognized once again as the fastest qualifier – for the eighth time! I actually found out I’d won while I was out buying fruit – my brother Álex didn’t manage the result he needed in the penultimate qualifying in Portimão to keep the contest open. But I promised him he’ll get to drive the car too! For us, it’s always something special when our performances on the track are recognized in this way. Now it’s time for the winter break, and my goal for 2026 is clear: to win the world championship, and this award, again!”\n\nThe 2025 winner’s car, the BMW M2 CS, is the latest exclusive special model from BMW M GmbH in the premium compact high-performance sports car segment. It impresses with outstanding agility, significantly increased performance, exceptional driving dynamics, and particularly sporty design features. The straight-six engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and high-revving characteristics delivers an impressive 390 kW/530 hp. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels via the standard 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. The BMW M2 CS accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds. Thanks to the extensive use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components in both the exterior and interior, the BMW M2 CS is also the lightest M2 of the current generation.\n\nAs part of its extensive activities as the “Official Car of MotoGP™”, BMW M GmbH presents the BMW M Award at the end of each season to the best qualifier. Before Márquez extended his record in 2025 with his eighth victory, Francesco Bagnaia had won the coveted award for the past three years.

The highlight of the virtual motorsport season is just around the corner – and the three official BMW M Motorsport teams are highly confident heading into the 2025 Esports World Cup (EWC). At the sim racing competition of the world’s largest esports tournament, BS+COMPETITION, MOUZ, and Team Redline will compete in Riyadh (KSA) from 8th to 11th July for a total prize pool of 500,000 US dollars. Team Redline will enter the event as reigning champions with a clear mission: to defend their title. In 2024, Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) also won the drivers' championship.\n\nAs in the previous year, the BMW M Motorsport teams, each with four drivers, came together in June for several days of intense preparation. The focus was on mental strength, self-control, mindfulness, and team cohesion – key success factors for a live event of this scale. From Munich (GER), the twelve brand ambassadors travelled to the remote Kaisertal in Tyrol (AUT), which can only be reached on foot. Accompanied by skilled mountain guides, the participants experienced exciting days away from the digital world – with outdoor activities, reflection sessions, and extraordinary physical challenges. The goal was to sharpen mental efficiency, better understand stress mechanisms, and build confidence in their own performance capabilities.\n\nTimo Brückner (Project Lead BMW M Automotive Gaming) said: “This preparation programme literally pushed our BMW M Motorsport drivers out of their comfort zones and made them stronger – physically, mentally, and as a team. The retreat in the mountains, the conscious disconnect from the digital day-to-day, the inspiring conversations, and the shared experiences created a new level of cohesion and focus. I’m confident that our teams will not only be extremely fast again at the Esports World Cup but will also stand out as exemplary ambassadors for BMW M Motorsport in the rapidly growing ‘automotive gaming’ segment.

What a weekend for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at Zandvoort (NED)! René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER) celebrated a 1-2 finish in the Sunday race at the third DTM event of the season. Rast set a new DTM record with his pole position for the race. With 26 career poles, he surpassed Bernd Schneider (GER) to become the sole record holder. Wittmann also reached a significant milestone, competing in his 200th DTM race on Sunday – a mark achieved by only seven other drivers in the series' history. His second-place finish on the podium was a fitting reward. In the ADAC GT Masters, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved a 1-2 result and a total of four podium finishes.\n\nSchubert Motorsport started the weekend strongly with first and third places in qualifying for the Sunday race, which was held on Friday due to the simultaneous Le Mans test. On Saturday, both drivers struggled on a wet track during the second qualifying session but made impressive comebacks in the race under changing weather conditions. Rast’s comeback ended with a retirement after an accident on a damp track, while Wittmann gained 14 positions to finish sixth.\n\nSunday’s race remained dry, and both Rast and Wittmann had excellent starts. Wittmann slotted into second place right behind Rast and was able to apply pressure in the final third of the race. However, the order remained unchanged, and both drivers celebrated the 1-2 result together. After the race, Rast complained of headaches and dizziness and was examined at the medical centre and later at a clinic in Haarlem (NED) as a precaution. This examination has given him the green light for his onward journey to Le Mans (FRA). He had hit his head before the race. In the drivers' standings, Rast moved up to second place with 75 points, 16 points behind leader Lucas Auer (AUT, Mercedes). Wittmann is sixth with 70 points. In the team standings, Schubert Motorsport is third with 139 points.\n\nWittmann reaches milestone of 200 DTM races. In Sunday’s race at Zandvoort, Wittmann became only the eighth driver in DTM history to reach the milestone of 200 races. Remarkably, all 200 races have been with BMW M Motorsport. Wittmann joined the DTM in 2012 at the age of 22 as a test and reserve driver and has been a full-time driver since 2013. He has won 19 of his 200 races, stood on the podium 47 times, and started from pole position 16 times. Wittmann was crowned champion in 2014 and 2016, both times driving the BMW M4 DTM. His first victory came at the 2014 season opener at Hockenheim (GER), and his most recent win was exactly one year ago in the Sunday race at Zandvoort.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Stellar weekend for FK Performance Motorsport. The ADAC GT Masters was even more successful for the BMW M Motorsport teams than the DTM. FK Performance Motorsport celebrated a 1-2 result with its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs on Sunday. Tim Zimmermann (GER) and Leyton Fourie (RSA) triumphed ahead of their teammates Julian Hanses (GER) and Eduardo Coseteng (PHI). On Saturday, Zimmermann and Fourie had already finished second on the podium, while Hanses and Coseteng came fourth. Sandro and Juliano Holzem (both GER) from Schubert Motorsport secured third place in Saturday’s race with their BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nComments on the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"What a fantastic weekend at Zandvoort. The 1-2 result in the DTM was a demonstration of the strength of our BMW M4 GT3 EVO. René Rast made a fantastic comeback after his retirement on Saturday, recovering many of the points he lost with his victory and pole position. Marco Wittmann drove exceptionally strong races on both days. I’m also incredibly thrilled about the results in the ADAC GT Masters. What FK Performance Motorsport achieved this weekend is incredible. A 1-2 finish on Sunday and second and fourth places on Saturday – simply fantastic! Schubert Motorsport also secured a podium finish on Saturday with third place. What more can you say about this weekend? It was simply a dream!\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): \"With this 1-2 result we’ve put ourselves back in the title race and shown that we’re back. We achieved the maximum, which unfortunately wasn’t the case on Saturday. Marco Wittmann’s sixth place was very good damage control, but more would have been possible if we had taken the risk of starting one car on slicks. Ultimately, it was a 50:50 decision, and like most of the field, we opted for wet tyres. In hindsight, slicks would have been better, but in such situations, it’s easy to get it wrong. Now we head to the Norisring, where we’ve been strong in the past and have already won races. We want to build on that.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: DNF, R2: 1st place): \"The team did a fantastic job and deserved this victory. For me, it wasn’t an easy race. After hitting my head before the start, I experienced pain during the race. I’m happy that I was able to move up in the drivers' standings after Saturday’s retirement thanks to the victory. I’m now second and still have every chance to fulfill my ‘Mission 4.’\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 6th place, R2: 2nd place): \"What a team result! We can be very happy with first and second places. René had very strong pace at the start of the race, but in the final stint, the tide turned, and I was able to close the gap. Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite enough for an attack, but with yesterday’s comeback and today’s podium, I’m very satisfied.

On Saturday, both drivers struggled on a wet track during the second qualifying session but made impressive comebacks in the race under changing weather conditions. Rast’s comeback ended with a retirement after an accident on a damp track, while Wittmann gained 14 positions to finish sixth.\n\nSunday’s race remained dry, and both Rast and Wittmann had excellent starts. Wittmann slotted into second place right behind Rast and was able to apply pressure in the final third of the race. However, the order remained unchanged, and both drivers celebrated the 1-2 result together. After the race, Rast complained of headaches and dizziness and was examined at the medical centre and later at a clinic in Haarlem (NED) as a precaution. This examination has given him the green light for his onward journey to Le Mans (FRA). He had hit his head before the race. In the drivers' standings, Rast moved up to second place with 75 points, 16 points behind leader Lucas Auer (AUT, Mercedes). Wittmann is sixth with 70 points. In the team standings, Schubert Motorsport is third with 139 points.\n\nWittmann reaches milestone of 200 DTM races. In Sunday’s race at Zandvoort, Wittmann became only the eighth driver in DTM history to reach the milestone of 200 races. Remarkably, all 200 races have been with BMW M Motorsport. Wittmann joined the DTM in 2012 at the age of 22 as a test and reserve driver and has been a full-time driver since 2013. He has won 19 of his 200 races, stood on the podium 47 times, and started from pole position 16 times. Wittmann was crowned champion in 2014 and 2016, both times driving the BMW M4 DTM. His first victory came at the 2014 season opener at Hockenheim (GER), and his most recent win was exactly one year ago in the Sunday race at Zandvoort.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Stellar weekend for FK Performance Motorsport. The ADAC GT Masters was even more successful for the BMW M Motorsport teams than the DTM. FK Performance Motorsport celebrated a 1-2 result with its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs on Sunday. Tim Zimmermann (GER) and Leyton Fourie (RSA) triumphed ahead of their teammates Julian Hanses (GER) and Eduardo Coseteng (PHI). On Saturday, Zimmermann and Fourie had already finished second on the podium, while Hanses and Coseteng came fourth. Sandro and Juliano Holzem (both GER) from Schubert Motorsport secured third place in Saturday’s race with their BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nComments on the race weekend:\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"What a fantastic weekend at Zandvoort. The 1-2 result in the DTM was a demonstration of the strength of our BMW M4 GT3 EVO. René Rast made a fantastic comeback after his retirement on Saturday, recovering many of the points he lost with his victory and pole position. Marco Wittmann drove exceptionally strong races on both days. I’m also incredibly thrilled about the results in the ADAC GT Masters. What FK Performance Motorsport achieved this weekend is incredible. A 1-2 finish on Sunday and second and fourth places on Saturday – simply fantastic! Schubert Motorsport also secured a podium finish on Saturday with third place. What more can you say about this weekend? It was simply a dream!\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): \"With this 1-2 result we’ve put ourselves back in the title race and shown that we’re back. We achieved the maximum, which unfortunately wasn’t the case on Saturday. Marco Wittmann’s sixth place was very good damage control, but more would have been possible if we had taken the risk of starting one car on slicks. Ultimately, it was a 50:50 decision, and like most of the field, we opted for wet tyres. In hindsight, slicks would have been better, but in such situations, it’s easy to get it wrong. Now we head to the Norisring, where we’ve been strong in the past and have already won races. We want to build on that.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: DNF, R2: 1st place): \"The team did a fantastic job and deserved this victory. For me, it wasn’t an easy race. After hitting my head before the start, I experienced pain during the race. I’m happy that I was able to move up in the drivers' standings after Saturday’s retirement thanks to the victory. I’m now second and still have every chance to fulfill my ‘Mission 4.’\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 6th place, R2: 2nd place): \"What a team result! We can be very happy with first and second places. René had very strong pace at the start of the race, but in the final stint, the tide turned, and I was able to close the gap. Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite enough for an attack, but with yesterday’s comeback and today’s podium, I’m very satisfied.

Based on the current S 1000 XR and S 1000 RR, the product substance of the M 1000 XR - M XR for short - has been tuned to meet the specific requirements of a long-distance sports bike. The riding dynamics speak for themselves, both on the country roads as well as on the race track and on long-distance journeys\".Dominik Blass, M 1000 XR Product Manager. The new BMW M 1000 XR: the long-distance sports bike designed to meet the highest demands, from dynamic riding on country roads to long-distance touring and racing.At the end of 2018, BMW Motorrad already introduced the successful M model range strategy for motorcycles and has been offering M special equipment and M performance parts ever since. The new BMW M 1000 XR is the third M model from BMW Motorrad to celebrate its world premiere, following the M 1000 RR superbike and the dynamic M 1000 R roadster: The long-distance sports bike M 1000 XR. In the centenary year of BMW Motorrad, the dynamic philosophy of the world's most powerful letter is also applied to the new M XR: M is synonymous worldwide with racing success and the fascination of high-performance BMW models and is aimed at customers with particularly high demands for performance, exclusivity and individuality. With an engine output of 148 kW (201 hp), a DIN empty weight of only 223 kg and suspension technology and aerodynamics designed equally for high-performance country road use, extended long-distance trips and fast laps on the race track, the new M XR, as the lightest representative of this crossover segment, opens up dynamic driving dimensions previously reserved for thoroughbred superbikes. Powerful M XR 4-cylinder based on the RR engine. Even more peak power, higher torque and increased thrust and traction thanks to shorter secondary and gear ratios for maximum riding pleasure on country roads and race tracks.The new M XR features a modified water-cooled 4-cylinder in-line engine based on the power unit of the S 1000 RR. Its peak power is 148 kW (201 hp) at 12,750 rpm, 23 kW (31 hp) more than in the new S 1000 XR. The maximum torque of 113 Nm is reached at 11,000 rpm. The maximum engine speed of the M XR is 14,600 rpm. Increased rear wheel pulling power in all gears is also provided by a shorter secondary gear ratio through the use of a sprocket with now 47 teeth (S 1000 XR: 45 teeth). In addition, the gear ratios of the 4th, 5th and 6th gear are now shorter compared to the S 1000 XR, which also benefits traction at the rear wheel, acceleration and pulling power. M winglets and wind deflectors: Brake later, reduce wheelies and accelerate earlier thanks to aerodynamic downforce.In addition to drive and suspension technology, aerodynamics was also a key item in the specifications for developing the M XR. The new M XR was given winglets in the area of the front side panels with the aim of achieving even faster lap times on the race track and the best possible riding stability at high speeds, From a speed of about 100 km/h, they provide an increase in front wheel load thanks to the aerodynamic downforce generated. It increases by approx. 12 kg at 220 km/h. Chassis trimmed for performance-oriented riding on country roads and race tracks with Dynamic Damping Control (DDC), adjustable spring base, adjustable steering damper, milled-over handlebar clamp and more front-oriented tubular handlebar with laser-etched \"BMW M XR\" lettering.The suspension and chassis of the new M XR are based on the S 1000 XR with the aluminium bridge frame as the centrepiece. The M XR features upside-down forks with a 45 mm slide tube diameter at the front. The forks are equipped with so-called closed cartridge inserts, separate hydraulic piston-cylinder systems. Another new feature of the M XR is the additional adjustability of the fork's spring base in conjunction with the standard Dynamic Damping Control (DDC) suspension strut. In addition, the forks of the M XR feature an upper fork bridge with an elaborately milled-over handlebar clamp as well as a more front-oriented black aluminium tubular handlebar with lasered \"BMW M 1000 XR\" lettering. The handlebar end mirrors available as an option ex works are also new on the M XR. The fork legs have also been modified and are now designed to accommodate the new M brake callipers. Another new element of the M XR is the adjustable steering damper. M brakes with radial hand brake pump and lightweight forged aluminium wheels for optimum riding dynamics on the race track and in performance mode. Exclusive M Carbon wheels are available as part of the M Competition package or as an individual option.After the M 1000 RR and the M 1000 R, the new M XR is the third BMW motorcycle to feature an M brake. It was developed directly using the experience gained with the racing brakes on BMW Motorrad factory racing machines in the Superbike World Championship. The M brake callipers feature a blue anodised coating in conjunction with the famous M logo. Together with two 320 mm brake discs of 5 mm thickness and black anodised aluminium brake disc carriers, the brake system equipped with a new radial hand brake pump currently marks the pinnacle of brake development in the field of road-legal systems. The new M XR is already equipped with very lightweight forged aluminium wheels as standard. As part of the M Competition package, the exclusive M Carbon wheels are available with newly designed tapes on the rim. Brake Slide Assist - assists the rider when brake drifting.The Brake Slide Assist function is an important and very helpful innovation, especially for race track riders. It allows the rider to brake drift into corners with a constant slide. Instrument cluster with perfectly readable 6.5-inch TFT display, new display of the rev counter (red area) and OBD interface for M GPS Datalogger and M GPS Laptrigger that can be used via unlock code.The instrument cluster of the new M XR corresponds to the design of the M RR and also offers the M start-up animation. The extended display of the red speed range is a new feature. As optional equipment, comprehensive data material for using the M GPS Laptrigger and the M GPS Datalogger (Original BMW Motorrad Accessories) can be provided by means of an unlock code via the OBD interface of the instrument cluster. M Design and the dynamic design of the M XR signal pure performance and sportiness. Even more than the S 1000 XR, the new M XR with its optimised chassis technology and the most powerful engine to date in a dynamic long-distance sports bike from BMW Motorrad is uncompromisingly designed for sporty riding - whether on country roads, long-distance tours or on the race track. M XR - there is currently no better performing and lighter vehicle in this crossover segment. The proportions of the M XR are ultra-compact and powerful. Three-dimensional surfaces create excitement and a dynamic look. Slim, sleek and extremely aggressive, the M XR's front end is unmistakable with its new M winglets, designed as quadruple wings. The performance-oriented look of the new M XR is also reflected in the colour concept, with the body in Black combined with the M colours Light Blue, Dark Blue and Red. Uncompromising design and technology: The M XR featuring the M Competition Package.If the new M XR in standard trim is still not enough for you, the M Competition Package offers a fascinating mix of refined components for the racing technology gourmet and the aesthetically minded rider alike. In addition, this makes the new M XR another 3 kg lighter. The M Competition Package includes M Carbon wheels, M Carbon parts such as rear wheel cover with integrated chain guard, side panels, front wheel cover, inner cover and ignition/steering lock cover as well as a fully adjustable M rider footrest system, passenger footrests and the MGPS Laptrigger (unlock code).

Based on the current S 1000 XR and S 1000 RR, the product substance of the M 1000 XR - M XR for short - has been tuned to meet the specific requirements of a long-distance sports bike. The riding dynamics speak for themselves, both on the country roads as well as on the race track and on long-distance journeys\".Dominik Blass, M 1000 XR Product Manager. The new BMW M 1000 XR: the long-distance sports bike designed to meet the highest demands, from dynamic riding on country roads to long-distance touring and racing.At the end of 2018, BMW Motorrad already introduced the successful M model range strategy for motorcycles and has been offering M special equipment and M performance parts ever since. The new BMW M 1000 XR is the third M model from BMW Motorrad to celebrate its world premiere, following the M 1000 RR superbike and the dynamic M 1000 R roadster: The long-distance sports bike M 1000 XR. In the centenary year of BMW Motorrad, the dynamic philosophy of the world's most powerful letter is also applied to the new M XR: M is synonymous worldwide with racing success and the fascination of high-performance BMW models and is aimed at customers with particularly high demands for performance, exclusivity and individuality. With an engine output of 148 kW (201 hp), a DIN empty weight of only 223 kg and suspension technology and aerodynamics designed equally for high-performance country road use, extended long-distance trips and fast laps on the race track, the new M XR, as the lightest representative of this crossover segment, opens up dynamic driving dimensions previously reserved for thoroughbred superbikes. Powerful M XR 4-cylinder based on the RR engine. Even more peak power, higher torque and increased thrust and traction thanks to shorter secondary and gear ratios for maximum riding pleasure on country roads and race tracks.The new M XR features a modified water-cooled 4-cylinder in-line engine based on the power unit of the S 1000 RR. Its peak power is 148 kW (201 hp) at 12,750 rpm, 23 kW (31 hp) more than in the new S 1000 XR. The maximum torque of 113 Nm is reached at 11,000 rpm. The maximum engine speed of the M XR is 14,600 rpm. Increased rear wheel pulling power in all gears is also provided by a shorter secondary gear ratio through the use of a sprocket with now 47 teeth (S 1000 XR: 45 teeth). In addition, the gear ratios of the 4th, 5th and 6th gear are now shorter compared to the S 1000 XR, which also benefits traction at the rear wheel, acceleration and pulling power. M winglets and wind deflectors: Brake later, reduce wheelies and accelerate earlier thanks to aerodynamic downforce.In addition to drive and suspension technology, aerodynamics was also a key item in the specifications for developing the M XR. The new M XR was given winglets in the area of the front side panels with the aim of achieving even faster lap times on the race track and the best possible riding stability at high speeds, From a speed of about 100 km/h, they provide an increase in front wheel load thanks to the aerodynamic downforce generated. It increases by approx. 12 kg at 220 km/h. Chassis trimmed for performance-oriented riding on country roads and race tracks with Dynamic Damping Control (DDC), adjustable spring base, adjustable steering damper, milled-over handlebar clamp and more front-oriented tubular handlebar with laser-etched \"BMW M XR\" lettering.The suspension and chassis of the new M XR are based on the S 1000 XR with the aluminium bridge frame as the centrepiece. The M XR features upside-down forks with a 45 mm slide tube diameter at the front. The forks are equipped with so-called closed cartridge inserts, separate hydraulic piston-cylinder systems. Another new feature of the M XR is the additional adjustability of the fork's spring base in conjunction with the standard Dynamic Damping Control (DDC) suspension strut. In addition, the forks of the M XR feature an upper fork bridge with an elaborately milled-over handlebar clamp as well as a more front-oriented black aluminium tubular handlebar with lasered \"BMW M 1000 XR\" lettering. The handlebar end mirrors available as an option ex works are also new on the M XR. The fork legs have also been modified and are now designed to accommodate the new M brake callipers. Another new element of the M XR is the adjustable steering damper. M brakes with radial hand brake pump and lightweight forged aluminium wheels for optimum riding dynamics on the race track and in performance mode. Exclusive M Carbon wheels are available as part of the M Competition package or as an individual option.After the M 1000 RR and the M 1000 R, the new M XR is the third BMW motorcycle to feature an M brake. It was developed directly using the experience gained with the racing brakes on BMW Motorrad factory racing machines in the Superbike World Championship. The M brake callipers feature a blue anodised coating in conjunction with the famous M logo. Together with two 320 mm brake discs of 5 mm thickness and black anodised aluminium brake disc carriers, the brake system equipped with a new radial hand brake pump currently marks the pinnacle of brake development in the field of road-legal systems. The new M XR is already equipped with very lightweight forged aluminium wheels as standard. As part of the M Competition package, the exclusive M Carbon wheels are available with newly designed tapes on the rim. Brake Slide Assist - assists the rider when brake drifting.The Brake Slide Assist function is an important and very helpful innovation, especially for race track riders. It allows the rider to brake drift into corners with a constant slide. Instrument cluster with perfectly readable 6.5-inch TFT display, new display of the rev counter (red area) and OBD interface for M GPS Datalogger and M GPS Laptrigger that can be used via unlock code.The instrument cluster of the new M XR corresponds to the design of the M RR and also offers the M start-up animation. The extended display of the red speed range is a new feature. As optional equipment, comprehensive data material for using the M GPS Laptrigger and the M GPS Datalogger (Original BMW Motorrad Accessories) can be provided by means of an unlock code via the OBD interface of the instrument cluster. M Design and the dynamic design of the M XR signal pure performance and sportiness. Even more than the S 1000 XR, the new M XR with its optimised chassis technology and the most powerful engine to date in a dynamic long-distance sports bike from BMW Motorrad is uncompromisingly designed for sporty riding - whether on country roads, long-distance tours or on the race track. M XR - there is currently no better performing and lighter vehicle in this crossover segment. The proportions of the M XR are ultra-compact and powerful. Three-dimensional surfaces create excitement and a dynamic look. Slim, sleek and extremely aggressive, the M XR's front end is unmistakable with its new M winglets, designed as quadruple wings. The performance-oriented look of the new M XR is also reflected in the colour concept, with the body in Black combined with the M colours Light Blue, Dark Blue and Red. Uncompromising design and technology: The M XR featuring the M Competition Package.If the new M XR in standard trim is still not enough for you, the M Competition Package offers a fascinating mix of refined components for the racing technology gourmet and the aesthetically minded rider alike. In addition, this makes the new M XR another 3 kg lighter. The M Competition Package includes M Carbon wheels, M Carbon parts such as rear wheel cover with integrated chain guard, side panels, front wheel cover, inner cover and ignition/steering lock cover as well as a fully adjustable M rider footrest system, passenger footrests and the MGPS Laptrigger (unlock code).

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.\n\nThe credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.\n\nReturn on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.\n\nThe BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS. However, this does not mean that topics which are assessed as “not-material” are necessarily less important.\n\nWe view sustainability holistically and as a competitive advantage. That is why we disclose our sustainability performance to our investors and customers.\n\nYou will note that the implementation of ESRS requirements have contributed over 100 additional pages to our Report. Due to the company-specific materiality assessment, comparability between companies remains limited – even within the same industry.\n\nIndeed, it can be questioned how much value the additional scope and limited comparability offer to stakeholders. Accordingly, we welcome the proposed regulatory changes in the draft of the so-called Omnibus package and look forward to the draft updates and reduced scope of the ESRS.\n\nUltimately, we want added value for our stakeholders – meaning relevant and concise information. It’s not just about reporting and compliance.\n\nSLIDE: Proposed Dividend and Payout Ratio\n\nOne important element of our stakeholder orientation is our shareholder return strategy, which the BMW Group remains committed to.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 4.30 euros per share of common stock and 4.32 euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This results in a total dividend payout of 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe proposed dividend for 2024 represents a payout ratio of 36.7%. This is within our long-term strategic target range of 30-40% and notably higher than the payout ratio in 2023.\n\nOn January 2nd, we began the final tranche of our ongoing second share buyback program, which should be completed by latest April 30th. This will conclude the second program – with 2 billion euros – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nBy this point in time, we will have reduced a total of 47 million shares in circulation since the start of the share buyback authorization in 2022. This corresponds to over 7% reduction in share capital.\n\nAt the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nYou will have noted that we have made a step change in our approach since 2021. Starting in 2022, we added share buybacks as an additional instrument alongside dividend payments. We have also increasingly used the range of dividend payout corridor. And we increased the share of Automotive free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous years’ levels to almost 100% this year.\n\nSo, let’s move to the Outlook for 2025.\n\nLooking to the market development:\n\nDue to stabilizing inflation and declining interest rates in many countries, we expect to see a rise in demand.\n\nHow will the BMW Group’s sales performance develop this year?\n\nGiven the robust economic situation, we anticipate a solid market development in the US. In Europe, we do expect growth driven by electrified vehicles. The market dynamics in China, however, will remain challenging.\n\nFor the full year, revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment are expected to be in the same range as 2024.\n\nOur guidance reflects the current status of our planning, including all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th, 2025.\n\nWhat do we expect for our key performance indicators in 2025?\n\nLet me focus on selected guidance parameters.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce vehicles.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the total impact of the tariff increases in place as of March 12th amounts to approximately 1 percentage point on the Auto EBIT margin. As a result, the EBIT margin is now expected between 5 to 7%. Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.\n\nThe Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.\n\nStarting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nWe remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.\n\nTo that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.\n\nSo, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.\n\nWith the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Annual Conference 2025"}]}

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter.

Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year.

BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%.

The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year.

As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.\n\nThe credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.\n\nReturn on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.\n\nThe BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS. However, this does not mean that topics which are assessed as “not-material” are necessarily less important.\n\nWe view sustainability holistically and as a competitive advantage. That is why we disclose our sustainability performance to our investors and customers.\n\nYou will note that the implementation of ESRS requirements have contributed over 100 additional pages to our Report. Due to the company-specific materiality assessment, comparability between companies remains limited – even within the same industry.\n\nIndeed, it can be questioned how much value the additional scope and limited comparability offer to stakeholders. Accordingly, we welcome the proposed regulatory changes in the draft of the so-called Omnibus package and look forward to the draft updates and reduced scope of the ESRS.\n\nUltimately, we want added value for our stakeholders – meaning relevant and concise information. It’s not just about reporting and compliance.\n\nSLIDE: Proposed Dividend and Payout Ratio\n\nOne important element of our stakeholder orientation is our shareholder return strategy, which the BMW Group remains committed to.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 4.30 euros per share of common stock and 4.32 euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This results in a total dividend payout of 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe proposed dividend for 2024 represents a payout ratio of 36.7%. This is within our long-term strategic target range of 30-40% and notably higher than the payout ratio in 2023.\n\nOn January 2nd, we began the final tranche of our ongoing second share buyback program, which should be completed by latest April 30th. This will conclude the second program – with 2 billion euros – more than half a year earlier than initially planned.\n\nBy this point in time, we will have reduced a total of 47 million shares in circulation since the start of the share buyback authorization in 2022. This corresponds to over 7% reduction in share capital.\n\nAt the upcoming AGM, the Board of Management of BMW AG plans to propose an agenda item, seeking a new five-year authorization to acquire treasury shares amounting to up to 10 percent of share capital.\n\nYou will have noted that we have made a step change in our approach since 2021. Starting in 2022, we added share buybacks as an additional instrument alongside dividend payments. We have also increasingly used the range of dividend payout corridor. And we increased the share of Automotive free cash flow distributed to shareholders from the previous years’ levels to almost 100% this year.\n\nSo, let’s move to the Outlook for 2025.\n\nLooking to the market development:\n\nDue to stabilizing inflation and declining interest rates in many countries, we expect to see a rise in demand.\n\nHow will the BMW Group’s sales performance develop this year?\n\nGiven the robust economic situation, we anticipate a solid market development in the US. In Europe, we do expect growth driven by electrified vehicles. The market dynamics in China, however, will remain challenging.\n\nFor the full year, revenues per vehicle in the Automotive segment are expected to be in the same range as 2024.\n\nOur guidance reflects the current status of our planning, including all the tariff increases in force as of March 12th, 2025.\n\nWhat do we expect for our key performance indicators in 2025?\n\nLet me focus on selected guidance parameters.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment we are forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce vehicles.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the total impact of the tariff increases in place as of March 12th amounts to approximately 1 percentage point on the Auto EBIT margin. As a result, the EBIT margin is now expected between 5 to 7%. Consequently, Return on Capital Employed in the Automotive segment should be within a range of 9 to 13%.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we anticipate a Return on Equity of 13 to 16%.\n\nThe Group’s pre-tax profit is expected to remain at the previous year’s level.\n\nStarting January 1st, 2025, we have adjusted the outlook range for Group EBT guidance. The existing bandwidth was too narrow to reflect the underlying movements in the segments. For details, please refer to the glossary of the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe full outlook for 2025 for all key performance indicators is also available in the BMW Group Report.\n\nFor the full year 2025, we expect a free cash flow in the Automotive Segment of over 5 billion euros.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group remains fully focused on achieving our short-term results without compromising our long-term strategic objectives.\n\nWe remain committed to our long-term target corridor of 8 to 10% EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment.\n\nTo that end, we are constantly enhancing our operational business to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities and optimize our returns.\n\nSo, after the peak in 2024, we not only expect to see a turnaround in R&D expenditure and CapEx in 2025, but also a turnaround in operational costs. And here I mean a cost decrease in nominal terms, covering the effects of inflation. This will become visible over the course of the year.\n\nAt the BMW Group, strong brands and emotional products have long built the foundation of our success.\n\nWith the technological boost from the NEUE KLASSE across the entire portfolio, we look forward to seeing the benefits from our investments start hitting the road later this year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finance, Facts, Figures, Corporate, Board Member Speeches, Corporate Events"}]}

At the same time, we are focused on our operational business to consistently deliver on what we say.\n\nThe BMW Group proved this once again in Q4 2024:\n\nWe successfully reduced inventory impacted by the Integrated Braking System or IBS. And we achieved a sequential improvement in retail sales and profit versus Q3.\n\nFor the full year, we achieved our revised guidance in all parameters.\n\nAs anticipated, we reached peak levels of R&D and capital expenditure in 2024, particularly to prepare for models of the NEUE KLASSE. Starting this year, both the R&D and capex ratios will decrease meaningfully, as we start production of the NEUE KLASSE and lay the foundation for the long-term success of our company with over 40 new and updated models by 2027.\n\nThrough our global positioning and the flexibility of our operations, we can adapt to the geopolitical landscape and short-term market dynamics, proving our resilience.\n\nLet’s take a look at the financial figures for the full year.\n\n2024 was a year of two halves:\n\nWhile the first half-year was in line with our original planning, sales performance in the second half of the year was impacted by delivery stops in connection with IBS, as well as persistent subdued demand in China. As expected, Q4 marked an improvement on the Q3 result.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group KPIs in FY24\n\nGroup revenues totaled 142.4 billion euros. The moderate decrease compared to 2023 was mainly driven by the decline in sales volume and intense price competition in the Chinese market.\n\nEarnings before Tax at Group level amounted to 11 billion euros – significantly under 2023, but as expected in our adjusted guidance. This resulted in a Group EBT Margin of 7.7% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: BMW Group Segment Performance in FY24\n\nIf we look at the key financial results of the individual segments:\n\nAutomotive delivered an EBIT of 7.89 billion euros and EBIT margin of 6.3%.\n\nMotorrad had an EBIT of 198 million euros, representing a margin of 6.1%.\n\nFinancial Services saw an EBT of 2.54 billion euros and a Return on Equity of 15.1%.\n\nAnd, finally, Other Entities generated 837 million euros in EBT, while eliminations amounted to a negative 146 million euros.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Retail Units, BEV Units, Auto Revenue and Auto EBIT in FY24\n\nSo, let’s take a look at the Automotive Segment in detail:\n\nFor the full year, the BMW Group delivered 2.45 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers worldwide. This represents a slight decrease of 4% from the previous year, in line with our adjusted guidance.\n\nMarket dynamics in China remain weak, which impacted sales performance. However, the BMW brand achieved growth in every other major region.\n\nIn Europe, order intake in Q4 improved month by month. In the US, we experienced a strong recovery from IBS in Q4 with growth quarter-over-quarter of just over 50% and year-over-year of 8.9%.\n\nWorldwide BMW Group sales performance in Q4 saw sequential improvement over Q3. Global deliveries grew by nearly a third quarter-on-quarter including double digit growth coming from the mid- and upper-segment together.\n\nAll-electric vehicles remained a key growth driver for us. BEV deliveries totaled over 426,000 units for the year, significantly above 2023 by 13.5%. Overall, BEVs therefore made up 17.4% of total sales.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid vehicles also remained very popular, with over 166,000 units sold in 2024. Electrified vehicles – meaning all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids – made up nearly a quarter of total sales.\n\nRevenues in the Automotive segment amounted to nearly 125 billion euros, a decrease of 5.6% from 2023.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes reached 7.9 billion euros. This resulted in an EBIT margin of 6.3%, which was within our adjusted guidance corridor of 6 to 7 percent for the full year.\n\nExcluding the 1.3 billion euros depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the Automotive EBIT margin came in at 7.4% for the year.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive EBIT Development in FY24\n\nLooking to the operating result in detail:\n\nCompared to 2023, EBIT for full-year 2024 saw a tailwind of 1 billion euros from the net balance of currency and raw material positions.\n\nYear on year, the net effect of volume, model mix and pricing weighed on Automotive EBIT. The headwind resulted partly from the volume decrease, particularly in China. Pricing headwinds, including the effects of a highly competitive Chinese market and dealer compensation in China, amounted to more than half of the overall decrease of 4.4 billion euros.\n\nThe headwind of 1.4 billion euros from Other cost changes was driven by inflation in material costs and supply chain support.\n\nThe effect from warranty expenses was a tailwind year-on-year. Overall, lower additions to warranty provisions for specific topics were necessary in every quarter throughout 2024 compared to the previous year. An exception was Q3, due to the impact of IBS. For the full year 2024, the P&L impact of quality issues trended in a positive direction year-on-year, as planned.\n\nSLIDE: R&D Expenditure in FY24\n\nSLIDE: Capital Expenditure in FY24\n\nOur R&D activities and investments focused on our ongoing electrification and digitalization strategy across the entire portfolio. As anticipated, R&D and capital expenditure reached peak levels in 2024 – both in absolute terms and in ratio.\n\nGroup expenditure for research and development for the full year reached 9.1 billion euros, compared to 7.8 billion euros in 2023. The R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was 6.4%, 1.4 percentage points more than in 2023.\n\nGroup capital expenditure totaled 9.1 billion euros, an increase from 8.8 billion euros in 2023. This resulted in a capex ratio of 6.4%, compared to 5.7% in 2023.\n\nAs we begin to rollout models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will see a decline in R&D and capex. This means in both absolute and relative terms, back towards our strategic corridors of between 4 to 5% for R&D and less than 5% for Capex by 2027 at the latest.\n\nSLIDE: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in FY24\n\nTurning to free cash flow – as you know, we steer this on an annual basis.\n\nStarting with EBT delivering a full year result of 7.5 billion euros, working capital contributed positively with 200 million euros to free cash flow. Whilst inventory levels had risen due to sales stops related to IBS in Q3, we managed to successfully reduce stock by 5 billion euros in Q4. As a result, year-end inventory reached nearly the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.\n\nFor the full year, the net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 3.3 billion euros.\n\nThe development of provisions reduced free cash flow by 700 million euros.\n\nThe position “Other” reflects several positive effects, including interest received.\n\nIn line with our adjusted guidance, free cash flow reached 4.9 billion euros in 2024.\n\nThis is even after we invested 18.2 billion euros: 9.1 billion euros in CapEx and another 9.1 billion euros in R&D, paving the way for our future, and demonstrating our financial strength.\n\nThis strength is underscored by our Automotive net financial assets, which benefitted from the strong development of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. At year end, the Automotive NFA came in at almost 46 billion euros, which is around the same level as the start of the year.\n\nSLIDE: Financial Services Segment in FY24\n\nMoving on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nNew business development in the segment remained robust throughout the year. A total of almost 1.7 million new financing and leasing contracts were concluded, a solid year-on-year increase of nearly 10%.\n\nOverall, new business volume even increased significantly by 12.5% to 64.5 billion euros, due to higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nPenetration rates for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.4 percentage points, reaching 42.6%. Without China, the penetration rate was over 50%, with growth in particular in the US and the UK.\n\nSegment earnings before tax amounted to 2.54 million euros and were therefore significantly lower than the previous year. This was mainly due to higher credit and residual value risk costs than in 2023, but well within our expectations. We continue to see gains from the sale of off-lease vehicles, yet at lower levels due to market dynamics.\n\nThe credit loss ratio of 0.26% across the entire credit portfolio was well within our expectations and below industry levels.\n\nReturn on Equity for the full year reached 15.1%, within our adjusted guidance range of 15 to 18%.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn our BMW Group Report, you will note that we have voluntarily adopted the full European Sustainability Reporting Standards for the first time as the framework for reporting all sustainability-related disclosures in our combined non-financial statement.\n\nThe BMW Group only reports on sustainability topics that have been assessed as “material” according to ESRS.

Players and experts had agreed that the dry conditions of recent weeks would lead to low scores at the 36th BMW International Open (2–6 July 2025). Thursday's opening round told a different story however. Only 22 of the 156 players managed to post a score better than two under par – mainly due to unpredictable winds across the Championship Course. Five players sit tied at the top of the leaderboard at five under par: England’s Marco Penge, Gavin Green from Malaysia, the Netherlands’ Darius van Driel, Ugo Coussaud of France, and Wenyi Ding from China. “I’ve been looking forward to coming back to this golf course,” said Penge. “I really think that as a long hitter you have some real advantages out here.”\n\nThe best Germans after 18 holes are Marcel Schneider and Martin Kaymer (both -2), followed by Marcel Siem and Jannik de Bruyn at one under par, with Matti Schmid, Yannik Paul and standout amateur Tim Wiedemeyer all at even par. Siem and Kaymer, who played in the same group alongside Nicolai von Dellingshausen (+2) and drew the largest galleries of the day, experienced a round full of highs and lows. Kaymer (-3 over the final three holes) and Siem (-4 over the final four) finished strongly and secured solid starts to their tournament.\n\n“I’m actually quite satisfied with my game – today’s result puts me in the tournament,” said Kaymer. “I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s round. It’s just fun playing with these two guys. The atmosphere in our group was really positive.”\n\nSiem, who yesterday declared that winning the 36th BMW International Open was his clear goal, capped off a rollercoaster round with a widely celebrated eagle on the 18th green. “It was a tough day out there. It felt like nothing was really working,” Siem said. “But I never give up. That finish was awesome. I’m still in the tournament. At one point, it looked like I’d need to go really low tomorrow just to make the cut. I said what I came here to do – now I’ve still got a chance. I’m super happy with the way I finished.”\n\nVon Dellingshausen, who had played solid golf for much of the round, summed up his day and the key moment: “That triple bogey on 14 still hurts. Overall, it was mostly cruise control out there – par was rarely in danger. Then out of nowhere came that disaster shot into the nettles on 14 – and I kind of lost my rhythm. It was really just one hole, but the score was so high it messed up the round a bit.”\n\nSiem’s closing eagle was one of 16 eagles made on the day. For each eagle scored during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group donates €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint goal is to equip children and young people with valuable life skills in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, and personal development.\n\nOn Friday, it will be decided which players make it into the weekend. With the field tightly packed, a fierce and thrilling battle for the cut is expected. The first tee time is at 7:30 a.m., with Kaymer, Siem, and von Dellingshausen set to tee off at 7:50 a.m. from hole 10.

I’m super happy with the way I finished.”\n\nVon Dellingshausen, who had played solid golf for much of the round, summed up his day and the key moment: “That triple bogey on 14 still hurts. Overall, it was mostly cruise control out there – par was rarely in danger. Then out of nowhere came that disaster shot into the nettles on 14 – and I kind of lost my rhythm. It was really just one hole, but the score was so high it messed up the round a bit.”\n\nSiem’s closing eagle was one of 16 eagles made on the day. For each eagle scored during the tournament rounds, the BMW Group donates €1,000 to the Philipp Lahm Foundation for Sport and Education. The joint goal is to equip children and young people with valuable life skills in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, and personal development.\n\nOn Friday, it will be decided which players make it into the weekend. With the field tightly packed, a fierce and thrilling battle for the cut is expected.

Welcome to our annual conference. 2025 will be a milestone year for the BMW Group in many respects – as we set the course today for our success in the decade to come. Despite volatile global conditions, we remain firmly committed to growth in the current financial year. At the same time, we are bringing our largest future-focused project, the NEUE KLASSE, to the roads. We have a clear plan: We remain sharply focused on innovation and sustainable growth. In 2025, we expect sales figures to rise once again. At the same time capital expenditure will decrease, as planned. This will enable us to increase our free cash flow. There are four reasons for our confidence: First:Our strategy is robust and gives us a clear path forward. We are setting the pace in key areas. Our technology open approach remains successful and is gaining more traction. Policymakers and competitors are pivoting in our direction – which we continue to pursue systematically. Second:The BMW Group is one of our industry’s few true global players. Our extensive global footprint creates opportunities. It makes us resilient. And it provides the flexibility we need to respond effectively to external influences. Third:With BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, we have four strong brands. All of them are incredibly popular around the globe. Each has its own distinct identity and delivers emotionally compelling products for different target groups. And fourth:Our NEUE KLASSE: No other manufacturer has a project as ambitious and ground-breaking as ours about to enter production. I will come to this in the second part of my presentation. Let's start with the first topic: our strategic direction.Our technology-open approach is market-oriented. It allows us to fully leverage the available potential across all markets and regions. We make no distinctions – whether we are talking about combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, all-electric vehicles or, from 2028, a hydrogen-powered car. We consistently implement design principles, innovation and the latest technologies in all our vehicles. No one masters this technological diversity better than we do. Numerous national and international accolades confirm this. Our approach is also gaining increasing recognition in political circles. Even our competitors are pivoting towards our strategy. We have proven that technological openness, growth and CO₂ reduction are very much compatible. Let’s take a look at 2024: We met our adjusted targets for the year. We delivered more than 2.45 million vehicles and achieved an EBIT margin of 6.3 percent in the Automotive Segment. Our vehicles with highly efficient combustion engines remain in strong demand worldwide. At the same time, battery-electric vehicles continue to be our main growth driver. Several other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – saw a decline in sales. But we achieved growth with our all-electric vehicles. Even in challenging market conditions. In 2024, BEV sales once again climbed significantly year-on-year – increasing by more than 13 percent. Fully-electric vehicles accounted for over 17 percent of total sales last year. Including plug-in hybrids, nearly one in four vehicles sold was electrified. We are targeting further growth in e-mobility in 2025. We will hit two major milestones this year: We will reach the total of more than three million electrified vehicles and over 1.5 million BEVs sold since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8. Our customers can choose between over 15 BEVs across all our brands. One example is the new edition of the BMW iX*: The recently presented model update boasts an impressive electric range of over 700 kilometres in the WLTP cycle – with significantly more drive power. That is BMW EfficientDynamics.Our combination of electrified vehicles and highly efficient combustion engines also has a positive impact on our climate footprint. In 2024, the BMW Group once again outperformed its European CO2 fleet target – by more than 30 grammes. Based on our internal calculations, our fleet emissions fell below 100 grammes per kilometre in the WLTP cycle for the first time. We will continue to ensure that our customers always have access to the latest technology – across all drivetrains. The key to achieving this lies in our production network’s high level of flexibility. That brings me to my second point:our global footprint. The BMW Group is a true global player. Very few automotive manufacturers have such a comprehensive presence across all relevant economic regions as we do. Be it in sales, research and development, production or our supplier network. This combination gives us a strategic advantage that sets us apart from the competition in an increasingly fragmented world. We remain committed to expanding our local for local approach. We are constantly improving our access to different market regions and strengthening our resilience, especially along supply chains.One example of this is our high-voltage battery assembly plants in the three major sales regions: Europe, the Americas and China. In total, five new assembly facilities for the next generation of high-voltage batteries are being built near our production sites worldwide – complete with a local supplier network. In this way, we are already creating the necessary conditions today for successful growth in the future. We are gradually adapting our production network to rising sales of electric vehicles. Late this year, our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary will become our first facility to exclusively produce all-electric vehicles. Our main plant in Munich will follow in 2027. Our production follows the market and our product range aligns with demand. We build roughly the same number of vehicles in our three key market regions of Europe, the US and China as we sell there. This balanced distribution is another key differentiator for the BMW Group. At the same time, Germany and the US serve as key export hubs for us. In 2024, we manufactured over one million vehicles at our plants in Germany. This represents about a quarter of the country’s total car production. 56 percent of these vehicles are then exported outside the European Union.An impressive proof of the BMW Group's significant contribution to industrial value creation in Germany. In the US, one out of every two vehicles from our Plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is exported. Last year, we achieved an export value of over 10 billion US dollars. This once again makes the BMW Group the largest automotive exporter in the United States by value. We benefit from an integrated global economy. That is why we continue to advocate for open markets and free trade. Third point: the performance of our brands. The success of the BMW Group is built on the global appeal and resonance of our four brands. At the same time, we know how to fulfil the specific needs and preferences of our customers in different markets with our products. Last year, our core BMW brand leveraged its strength to the full: In three out of four regions, BMW grew sales and gained market share. This has enabled BMW to maintain its number one position in the global premium segment. BMW performed particularly well in Europe. Italy, Spain, France and the UK led the way, with all reporting double-digit growth rates.With a six-percent increase, the brand significantly outperformed the overall European market, which only grew by just over one percent. In the US market, we achieved record sales for the second consecutive year. Here, too, the strength of our market-driven approach to drivetrains is delivering results. Thanks to our steadily growing BEV portfolio, we sold more than 50,000 electric vehicles in the US for the first time. With this momentum, we are optimistic about the year ahead, as we celebrate “50 years of BMW North America”. In our markets outside the main sales regions, we also posted growth, in a declining environment overall. In this region, we lead the premium segment in total for the first time ever. The main growth drivers here included the South Korean, Australian and Indian markets. China remains a key market for the BMW Group. In 2024, we sold more than a quarter of all our vehicles there. The market is highly dynamic and characterised by increased competitive pressure. In this environment, BMW maintained nonetheless its position as the number one in its segment with a market share of three per cent. This put us within our target range. In 2024, we delivered over 100,000 BEVs to customers in China for the first time. This makes China our biggest single market for electric vehicles – even though our sales performance there was dampened last year by persistently low consumer sentiment. The high-margin vehicles built by BMW M once again played an important role in our market success in 2024. For the 13th consecutive year, M sales increased. Nearly one in ten BMWs sold carried the letter M. Demand for the sportiest BMW models has continued to grow, especially in China. 2025 is the first year with the complete New MINI Family available. And we will exploit this potential. There are a total of five unique models to choose from – three of them BEVs. The fully-electric MINI models – with the MINI Cooper Electric* leading the way – are being particularly well received. With an increase of 24 percent year-on-year, sales of MINI BEVs also saw highly dynamic growth last year. Nearly one in four MINIs is now powered by an electric heart. In the ultra-luxury segment, Rolls-Royce continues to set the benchmark. At more than 5,700 units, Rolls-Royce sales remain high.Most notably, the all-electric Spectre exceeded expectations in its first full year of sales. Every third Rolls-Royce sold is now fully-electric. BMW Motorrad also impressed in 2024, achieving a new all-time sales high of over 210,000 units. BMW Motorrad remains the undisputed number one in the global premium motorcycle segment. Ladies and Gentlemen, All of this shows that the BMW Group is well positioned across all brands, drive technologies and segments to continue on its growth path. With our global approach, we have the right answers to challenges worldwide. This has often enabled us to offset fluctuations in demand in individual markets. Now, it is time for Walter Mertl to present the Group Financial Statements for 2024 and look ahead to our goals for 2025. Part II: Ladies and Gentlemen, Growth and innovation – these are two of the main topics we will be focusing on this year. At the same time, we stand on the threshold of a new era. Late this year, we will launch our NEUE KLASSE: a project that is unprecedented in both form and significance in the history of the BMW Group. With the NEUE KLASSE, we will be turning the mobility of the future into reality. Driving dynamics, drivetrain, battery technology, operating concept, digitalisation: We have refined each of these aspects and, in the case of design, even skipped a generation. In this way, we are redefining not only the BMW brand, but also the future of individual mobility. Standing here next to me is the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X: the series version of this vehicle will kick off the NEUE KLASSE. Production will ramp up at our new plant in Debrecen late this year.After that, the rollout will continue in rapid succession, including a sporty sedan at the core of the BMW brand in 2026. We are deliberately starting out in high-volume segments: We want our innovations to have a broad impact, not just in niche segments. Between now and 2027, we will release more than 40 new or updated BMW models onto the market – from electric to plug-in hybrid to vehicles with combustion engines. Each will have the DNA of the NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE KLASSE is BMW and BMW is the NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE KLASSE is more than just a single vehicle. It marks the beginning of a completely new generation and introduces our technology boosters for the entire brand. Regardless of the drive technology, all future BMW models will benefit from the technologies of the NEUE KLASSE – and, of course, also from the new design language. Allow me to share a few examples of our groundbreaking advances in technology: With the BMW Panoramic iDrive, we are re-imagining our typical BMW driver orientation. The all new BMW Panoramic Vision is the centrepiece. This newly-developed additional Head-Up Display projects content across the full width of the windscreen. Seamless integration of various display and operating elements enables a completely new level of intuitive interaction. From the launch of the very first model of the NEUE KLASSE, all future BMW models will come with BMW Panoramic iDrive. The sixth generation of our BMW eDrive technology will make e-mobility even more appealing to our customers. The new BMW round cells promise 20 percent higher energy density, 30 percent faster charging and at least 30 percent more range. And within just 10 minutes, enough energy for another 300 kilometres can be recharged. For the first time, the Gen6 high-voltage batteries also feature the latest 800-volt technology and enable bi-directional charging. Compared to the current fifth generation, we will reduce the cost of the high voltage battery by 40-50 percent, on a comparable electric range basis. The electronics architecture has also been completely redesigned. Going forward, its four high-performance computers will control key customer functionalities. For example driving dynamics, automated driving and infotainment. These “super-brains” deliver more than 20 times the in-vehicle computing power than current systems. This makes our models future-proof for software and function updates, as well as new AI features. We have also greatly simplified the electrical system, dividing it into four zones, with intelligent control. 600 metres less wiring, a 30 percent reduction in weight and a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency are just some of the improvements we will achieve with this. And, of course, we are also harnessing technical opportunities to take driving dynamics to a whole new level. The BMW Vision Driving Experience showcases the potential of the technologies introduced in the NEUE KLASSE. We are pushing driving dynamics to its physical limits. This highly emotional driving machine will thrill more than just BMW fans. The VDX is the most powerful development prototype BMW has ever built. We are using it to test our “Heart of Joy” – one of the four super-brains in the NEUE KLASSE. We developed the software for the driving dynamics control system entirely in-house. This will be used in all future electric BMW models, setting new standards for dynamic performance and efficiency. It is hard to put into words exactly how it feels behind the wheel. You simply have to experience it. Take a look for yourselves at what our “Heart of Joy” can do, paired with a maximum torque of 18,000 Newton meters. You can't fake that kind of enthusiasm. Our Board of Management already had the chance to drive the series version of the NEUE KLASSE. Let me tell you: We were all equally excited about the driving experience – but not just in terms of pushing the physical limits. Most importantly, we were deeply impressed by the added value our technologies create for our customers in everyday situations. This is truly the next level of Sheer Driving Pleasure. Ladies and Gentlemen, We first announced the NEUE KLASSE at our Annual Conference back in 2021. Today, just four years later, we are entering the final stretch. Standing next to me is one of the prototype vehicles we have been producing in Debrecen since late last year. What is still hidden under camouflage foil here will be unveiled at the IAA MOBILITY in Munich in early September. There we will present the production model that will be available to our customers. I can already reveal one key detail to you today: this BMW will be released onto the market as the BMW iX3. This is how we continue the success story of the first all-electric BMW X model that has won over BMW fans worldwide since 2020. Testing of the BMW iX3 is in full swing. These impressions show that the next BMW iX3 is a typical X model, and a BMW through and through. As I’m sure you saw at the end of the film: The final phase of development for the sporty sedan, the second NEUE KLASSE vehicle, is also progressing rapidly.Ladies and Gentlemen, What has always set the BMW Group apart is that we keep our sights set on operational performance in the here and now. At the same time, we lay the foundation for our long-term future success. We will continue to consistently pursue our BMW path – with foresight, customer focus, self-confidence and in the knowledge of our strengths. We are ready. More than ever.

Welcome to our annual conference. 2025 will be a milestone year for the BMW Group in many respects – as we set the course today for our success in the decade to come. Despite volatile global conditions, we remain firmly committed to growth in the current financial year. At the same time, we are bringing our largest future-focused project, the NEUE KLASSE, to the roads. We have a clear plan: We remain sharply focused on innovation and sustainable growth. In 2025, we expect sales figures to rise once again. At the same time capital expenditure will decrease, as planned. This will enable us to increase our free cash flow. There are four reasons for our confidence: First:Our strategy is robust and gives us a clear path forward. We are setting the pace in key areas. Our technology open approach remains successful and is gaining more traction. Policymakers and competitors are pivoting in our direction – which we continue to pursue systematically. Second:The BMW Group is one of our industry’s few true global players. Our extensive global footprint creates opportunities. It makes us resilient. And it provides the flexibility we need to respond effectively to external influences. Third:With BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, we have four strong brands. All of them are incredibly popular around the globe. Each has its own distinct identity and delivers emotionally compelling products for different target groups. And fourth:Our NEUE KLASSE: No other manufacturer has a project as ambitious and ground-breaking as ours about to enter production. I will come to this in the second part of my presentation. Let's start with the first topic: our strategic direction.Our technology-open approach is market-oriented. It allows us to fully leverage the available potential across all markets and regions. We make no distinctions – whether we are talking about combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, all-electric vehicles or, from 2028, a hydrogen-powered car. We consistently implement design principles, innovation and the latest technologies in all our vehicles. No one masters this technological diversity better than we do. Numerous national and international accolades confirm this. Our approach is also gaining increasing recognition in political circles. Even our competitors are pivoting towards our strategy. We have proven that technological openness, growth and CO₂ reduction are very much compatible. Let’s take a look at 2024: We met our adjusted targets for the year. We delivered more than 2.45 million vehicles and achieved an EBIT margin of 6.3 percent in the Automotive Segment. Our vehicles with highly efficient combustion engines remain in strong demand worldwide. At the same time, battery-electric vehicles continue to be our main growth driver. Several other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – saw a decline in sales. But we achieved growth with our all-electric vehicles. Even in challenging market conditions. In 2024, BEV sales once again climbed significantly year-on-year – increasing by more than 13 percent. Fully-electric vehicles accounted for over 17 percent of total sales last year. Including plug-in hybrids, nearly one in four vehicles sold was electrified. We are targeting further growth in e-mobility in 2025. We will hit two major milestones this year: We will reach the total of more than three million electrified vehicles and over 1.5 million BEVs sold since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8. Our customers can choose between over 15 BEVs across all our brands. One example is the new edition of the BMW iX*: The recently presented model update boasts an impressive electric range of over 700 kilometres in the WLTP cycle – with significantly more drive power. That is BMW EfficientDynamics.Our combination of electrified vehicles and highly efficient combustion engines also has a positive impact on our climate footprint. In 2024, the BMW Group once again outperformed its European CO2 fleet target – by more than 30 grammes. Based on our internal calculations, our fleet emissions fell below 100 grammes per kilometre in the WLTP cycle for the first time. We will continue to ensure that our customers always have access to the latest technology – across all drivetrains. The key to achieving this lies in our production network’s high level of flexibility. That brings me to my second point:our global footprint. The BMW Group is a true global player. Very few automotive manufacturers have such a comprehensive presence across all relevant economic regions as we do. Be it in sales, research and development, production or our supplier network. This combination gives us a strategic advantage that sets us apart from the competition in an increasingly fragmented world. We remain committed to expanding our local for local approach. We are constantly improving our access to different market regions and strengthening our resilience, especially along supply chains.One example of this is our high-voltage battery assembly plants in the three major sales regions: Europe, the Americas and China. In total, five new assembly facilities for the next generation of high-voltage batteries are being built near our production sites worldwide – complete with a local supplier network. In this way, we are already creating the necessary conditions today for successful growth in the future. We are gradually adapting our production network to rising sales of electric vehicles. Late this year, our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary will become our first facility to exclusively produce all-electric vehicles. Our main plant in Munich will follow in 2027. Our production follows the market and our product range aligns with demand. We build roughly the same number of vehicles in our three key market regions of Europe, the US and China as we sell there. This balanced distribution is another key differentiator for the BMW Group. At the same time, Germany and the US serve as key export hubs for us. In 2024, we manufactured over one million vehicles at our plants in Germany. This represents about a quarter of the country’s total car production. 56 percent of these vehicles are then exported outside the European Union.An impressive proof of the BMW Group's significant contribution to industrial value creation in Germany. In the US, one out of every two vehicles from our Plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is exported. Last year, we achieved an export value of over 10 billion US dollars. This once again makes the BMW Group the largest automotive exporter in the United States by value. We benefit from an integrated global economy. That is why we continue to advocate for open markets and free trade. Third point: the performance of our brands. The success of the BMW Group is built on the global appeal and resonance of our four brands. At the same time, we know how to fulfil the specific needs and preferences of our customers in different markets with our products. Last year, our core BMW brand leveraged its strength to the full: In three out of four regions, BMW grew sales and gained market share. This has enabled BMW to maintain its number one position in the global premium segment. BMW performed particularly well in Europe. Italy, Spain, France and the UK led the way, with all reporting double-digit growth rates.With a six-percent increase, the brand significantly outperformed the overall European market, which only grew by just over one percent. In the US market, we achieved record sales for the second consecutive year. Here, too, the strength of our market-driven approach to drivetrains is delivering results. Thanks to our steadily growing BEV portfolio, we sold more than 50,000 electric vehicles in the US for the first time. With this momentum, we are optimistic about the year ahead, as we celebrate “50 years of BMW North America”. In our markets outside the main sales regions, we also posted growth, in a declining environment overall. In this region, we lead the premium segment in total for the first time ever. The main growth drivers here included the South Korean, Australian and Indian markets. China remains a key market for the BMW Group. In 2024, we sold more than a quarter of all our vehicles there. The market is highly dynamic and characterised by increased competitive pressure. In this environment, BMW maintained nonetheless its position as the number one in its segment with a market share of three per cent. This put us within our target range. In 2024, we delivered over 100,000 BEVs to customers in China for the first time. This makes China our biggest single market for electric vehicles – even though our sales performance there was dampened last year by persistently low consumer sentiment. The high-margin vehicles built by BMW M once again played an important role in our market success in 2024. For the 13th consecutive year, M sales increased. Nearly one in ten BMWs sold carried the letter M. Demand for the sportiest BMW models has continued to grow, especially in China. 2025 is the first year with the complete New MINI Family available. And we will exploit this potential. There are a total of five unique models to choose from – three of them BEVs. The fully-electric MINI models – with the MINI Cooper Electric* leading the way – are being particularly well received. With an increase of 24 percent year-on-year, sales of MINI BEVs also saw highly dynamic growth last year. Nearly one in four MINIs is now powered by an electric heart. In the ultra-luxury segment, Rolls-Royce continues to set the benchmark. At more than 5,700 units, Rolls-Royce sales remain high.Most notably, the all-electric Spectre exceeded expectations in its first full year of sales. Every third Rolls-Royce sold is now fully-electric. BMW Motorrad also impressed in 2024, achieving a new all-time sales high of over 210,000 units. BMW Motorrad remains the undisputed number one in the global premium motorcycle segment. Ladies and Gentlemen, All of this shows that the BMW Group is well positioned across all brands, drive technologies and segments to continue on its growth path. With our global approach, we have the right answers to challenges worldwide. This has often enabled us to offset fluctuations in demand in individual markets. Now, it is time for Walter Mertl to present the Group Financial Statements for 2024 and look ahead to our goals for 2025. Part II: Ladies and Gentlemen, Growth and innovation – these are two of the main topics we will be focusing on this year. At the same time, we stand on the threshold of a new era. Late this year, we will launch our NEUE KLASSE: a project that is unprecedented in both form and significance in the history of the BMW Group. With the NEUE KLASSE, we will be turning the mobility of the future into reality. Driving dynamics, drivetrain, battery technology, operating concept, digitalisation: We have refined each of these aspects and, in the case of design, even skipped a generation. In this way, we are redefining not only the BMW brand, but also the future of individual mobility. Standing here next to me is the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X: the series version of this vehicle will kick off the NEUE KLASSE. Production will ramp up at our new plant in Debrecen late this year.After that, the rollout will continue in rapid succession, including a sporty sedan at the core of the BMW brand in 2026. We are deliberately starting out in high-volume segments: We want our innovations to have a broad impact, not just in niche segments. Between now and 2027, we will release more than 40 new or updated BMW models onto the market – from electric to plug-in hybrid to vehicles with combustion engines. Each will have the DNA of the NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE KLASSE is BMW and BMW is the NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE KLASSE is more than just a single vehicle. It marks the beginning of a completely new generation and introduces our technology boosters for the entire brand. Regardless of the drive technology, all future BMW models will benefit from the technologies of the NEUE KLASSE – and, of course, also from the new design language. Allow me to share a few examples of our groundbreaking advances in technology: With the BMW Panoramic iDrive, we are re-imagining our typical BMW driver orientation. The all new BMW Panoramic Vision is the centrepiece. This newly-developed additional Head-Up Display projects content across the full width of the windscreen. Seamless integration of various display and operating elements enables a completely new level of intuitive interaction. From the launch of the very first model of the NEUE KLASSE, all future BMW models will come with BMW Panoramic iDrive. The sixth generation of our BMW eDrive technology will make e-mobility even more appealing to our customers. The new BMW round cells promise 20 percent higher energy density, 30 percent faster charging and at least 30 percent more range. And within just 10 minutes, enough energy for another 300 kilometres can be recharged. For the first time, the Gen6 high-voltage batteries also feature the latest 800-volt technology and enable bi-directional charging. Compared to the current fifth generation, we will reduce the cost of the high voltage battery by 40-50 percent, on a comparable electric range basis. The electronics architecture has also been completely redesigned. Going forward, its four high-performance computers will control key customer functionalities. For example driving dynamics, automated driving and infotainment. These “super-brains” deliver more than 20 times the in-vehicle computing power than current systems. This makes our models future-proof for software and function updates, as well as new AI features. We have also greatly simplified the electrical system, dividing it into four zones, with intelligent control. 600 metres less wiring, a 30 percent reduction in weight and a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency are just some of the improvements we will achieve with this. And, of course, we are also harnessing technical opportunities to take driving dynamics to a whole new level. The BMW Vision Driving Experience showcases the potential of the technologies introduced in the NEUE KLASSE. We are pushing driving dynamics to its physical limits. This highly emotional driving machine will thrill more than just BMW fans. The VDX is the most powerful development prototype BMW has ever built. We are using it to test our “Heart of Joy” – one of the four super-brains in the NEUE KLASSE. We developed the software for the driving dynamics control system entirely in-house. This will be used in all future electric BMW models, setting new standards for dynamic performance and efficiency. It is hard to put into words exactly how it feels behind the wheel. You simply have to experience it. Take a look for yourselves at what our “Heart of Joy” can do, paired with a maximum torque of 18,000 Newton meters. You can't fake that kind of enthusiasm. Our Board of Management already had the chance to drive the series version of the NEUE KLASSE. Let me tell you: We were all equally excited about the driving experience – but not just in terms of pushing the physical limits. Most importantly, we were deeply impressed by the added value our technologies create for our customers in everyday situations. This is truly the next level of Sheer Driving Pleasure.

Welcome to our annual conference. 2025 will be a milestone year for the BMW Group in many respects – as we set the course today for our success in the decade to come. Despite volatile global conditions, we remain firmly committed to growth in the current financial year. At the same time, we are bringing our largest future-focused project, the NEUE KLASSE, to the roads. We have a clear plan: We remain sharply focused on innovation and sustainable growth. In 2025, we expect sales figures to rise once again. At the same time capital expenditure will decrease, as planned. This will enable us to increase our free cash flow. There are four reasons for our confidence: First:Our strategy is robust and gives us a clear path forward. We are setting the pace in key areas. Our technology open approach remains successful and is gaining more traction. Policymakers and competitors are pivoting in our direction – which we continue to pursue systematically. Second:The BMW Group is one of our industry’s few true global players. Our extensive global footprint creates opportunities. It makes us resilient. And it provides the flexibility we need to respond effectively to external influences. Third:With BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, we have four strong brands. All of them are incredibly popular around the globe. Each has its own distinct identity and delivers emotionally compelling products for different target groups. And fourth:Our NEUE KLASSE: No other manufacturer has a project as ambitious and ground-breaking as ours about to enter production. I will come to this in the second part of my presentation. Let's start with the first topic: our strategic direction.Our technology-open approach is market-oriented. It allows us to fully leverage the available potential across all markets and regions. We make no distinctions – whether we are talking about combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, all-electric vehicles or, from 2028, a hydrogen-powered car. We consistently implement design principles, innovation and the latest technologies in all our vehicles. No one masters this technological diversity better than we do. Numerous national and international accolades confirm this. Our approach is also gaining increasing recognition in political circles. Even our competitors are pivoting towards our strategy. We have proven that technological openness, growth and CO₂ reduction are very much compatible. Let’s take a look at 2024: We met our adjusted targets for the year. We delivered more than 2.45 million vehicles and achieved an EBIT margin of 6.3 percent in the Automotive Segment. Our vehicles with highly efficient combustion engines remain in strong demand worldwide. At the same time, battery-electric vehicles continue to be our main growth driver. Several other manufacturers – including some that only produce electric cars – saw a decline in sales. But we achieved growth with our all-electric vehicles. Even in challenging market conditions. In 2024, BEV sales once again climbed significantly year-on-year – increasing by more than 13 percent. Fully-electric vehicles accounted for over 17 percent of total sales last year. Including plug-in hybrids, nearly one in four vehicles sold was electrified. We are targeting further growth in e-mobility in 2025. We will hit two major milestones this year: We will reach the total of more than three million electrified vehicles and over 1.5 million BEVs sold since the launch of the BMW i3 and BMW i8. Our customers can choose between over 15 BEVs across all our brands. One example is the new edition of the BMW iX*: The recently presented model update boasts an impressive electric range of over 700 kilometres in the WLTP cycle – with significantly more drive power. That is BMW EfficientDynamics.Our combination of electrified vehicles and highly efficient combustion engines also has a positive impact on our climate footprint. In 2024, the BMW Group once again outperformed its European CO2 fleet target – by more than 30 grammes. Based on our internal calculations, our fleet emissions fell below 100 grammes per kilometre in the WLTP cycle for the first time. We will continue to ensure that our customers always have access to the latest technology – across all drivetrains. The key to achieving this lies in our production network’s high level of flexibility. That brings me to my second point:our global footprint. The BMW Group is a true global player. Very few automotive manufacturers have such a comprehensive presence across all relevant economic regions as we do. Be it in sales, research and development, production or our supplier network. This combination gives us a strategic advantage that sets us apart from the competition in an increasingly fragmented world. We remain committed to expanding our local for local approach. We are constantly improving our access to different market regions and strengthening our resilience, especially along supply chains.One example of this is our high-voltage battery assembly plants in the three major sales regions: Europe, the Americas and China. In total, five new assembly facilities for the next generation of high-voltage batteries are being built near our production sites worldwide – complete with a local supplier network. In this way, we are already creating the necessary conditions today for successful growth in the future. We are gradually adapting our production network to rising sales of electric vehicles. Late this year, our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary will become our first facility to exclusively produce all-electric vehicles. Our main plant in Munich will follow in 2027. Our production follows the market and our product range aligns with demand. We build roughly the same number of vehicles in our three key market regions of Europe, the US and China as we sell there. This balanced distribution is another key differentiator for the BMW Group. At the same time, Germany and the US serve as key export hubs for us. In 2024, we manufactured over one million vehicles at our plants in Germany. This represents about a quarter of the country’s total car production. 56 percent of these vehicles are then exported outside the European Union.An impressive proof of the BMW Group's significant contribution to industrial value creation in Germany. In the US, one out of every two vehicles from our Plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, is exported. Last year, we achieved an export value of over 10 billion US dollars. This once again makes the BMW Group the largest automotive exporter in the United States by value. We benefit from an integrated global economy. That is why we continue to advocate for open markets and free trade. Third point: the performance of our brands. The success of the BMW Group is built on the global appeal and resonance of our four brands. At the same time, we know how to fulfil the specific needs and preferences of our customers in different markets with our products. Last year, our core BMW brand leveraged its strength to the full: In three out of four regions, BMW grew sales and gained market share. This has enabled BMW to maintain its number one position in the global premium segment. BMW performed particularly well in Europe. Italy, Spain, France and the UK led the way, with all reporting double-digit growth rates.With a six-percent increase, the brand significantly outperformed the overall European market, which only grew by just over one percent. In the US market, we achieved record sales for the second consecutive year. Here, too, the strength of our market-driven approach to drivetrains is delivering results. Thanks to our steadily growing BEV portfolio, we sold more than 50,000 electric vehicles in the US for the first time. With this momentum, we are optimistic about the year ahead, as we celebrate “50 years of BMW North America”. In our markets outside the main sales regions, we also posted growth, in a declining environment overall. In this region, we lead the premium segment in total for the first time ever. The main growth drivers here included the South Korean, Australian and Indian markets. China remains a key market for the BMW Group. In 2024, we sold more than a quarter of all our vehicles there. The market is highly dynamic and characterised by increased competitive pressure. In this environment, BMW maintained nonetheless its position as the number one in its segment with a market share of three per cent. This put us within our target range. In 2024, we delivered over 100,000 BEVs to customers in China for the first time. This makes China our biggest single market for electric vehicles – even though our sales performance there was dampened last year by persistently low consumer sentiment. The high-margin vehicles built by BMW M once again played an important role in our market success in 2024. For the 13th consecutive year, M sales increased. Nearly one in ten BMWs sold carried the letter M. Demand for the sportiest BMW models has continued to grow, especially in China. 2025 is the first year with the complete New MINI Family available. And we will exploit this potential. There are a total of five unique models to choose from – three of them BEVs. The fully-electric MINI models – with the MINI Cooper Electric* leading the way – are being particularly well received. With an increase of 24 percent year-on-year, sales of MINI BEVs also saw highly dynamic growth last year. Nearly one in four MINIs is now powered by an electric heart. In the ultra-luxury segment, Rolls-Royce continues to set the benchmark. At more than 5,700 units, Rolls-Royce sales remain high.Most notably, the all-electric Spectre exceeded expectations in its first full year of sales. Every third Rolls-Royce sold is now fully-electric. BMW Motorrad also impressed in 2024, achieving a new all-time sales high of over 210,000 units. BMW Motorrad remains the undisputed number one in the global premium motorcycle segment. Ladies and Gentlemen, All of this shows that the BMW Group is well positioned across all brands, drive technologies and segments to continue on its growth path. With our global approach, we have the right answers to challenges worldwide. This has often enabled us to offset fluctuations in demand in individual markets. Now, it is time for Walter Mertl to present the Group Financial Statements for 2024 and look ahead to our goals for 2025. Part II: Ladies and Gentlemen, Growth and innovation – these are two of the main topics we will be focusing on this year. At the same time, we stand on the threshold of a new era. Late this year, we will launch our NEUE KLASSE: a project that is unprecedented in both form and significance in the history of the BMW Group. With the NEUE KLASSE, we will be turning the mobility of the future into reality. Driving dynamics, drivetrain, battery technology, operating concept, digitalisation: We have refined each of these aspects and, in the case of design, even skipped a generation. In this way, we are redefining not only the BMW brand, but also the future of individual mobility. Standing here next to me is the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X: the series version of this vehicle will kick off the NEUE KLASSE. Production will ramp up at our new plant in Debrecen late this year.After that, the rollout will continue in rapid succession, including a sporty sedan at the core of the BMW brand in 2026. We are deliberately starting out in high-volume segments: We want our innovations to have a broad impact, not just in niche segments. Between now and 2027, we will release more than 40 new or updated BMW models onto the market – from electric to plug-in hybrid to vehicles with combustion engines. Each will have the DNA of the NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE KLASSE is BMW and BMW is the NEUE KLASSE. The NEUE KLASSE is more than just a single vehicle. It marks the beginning of a completely new generation and introduces our technology boosters for the entire brand. Regardless of the drive technology, all future BMW models will benefit from the technologies of the NEUE KLASSE – and, of course, also from the new design language. Allow me to share a few examples of our groundbreaking advances in technology: With the BMW Panoramic iDrive, we are re-imagining our typical BMW driver orientation. The all new BMW Panoramic Vision is the centrepiece. This newly-developed additional Head-Up Display projects content across the full width of the windscreen. Seamless integration of various display and operating elements enables a completely new level of intuitive interaction. From the launch of the very first model of the NEUE KLASSE, all future BMW models will come with BMW Panoramic iDrive. The sixth generation of our BMW eDrive technology will make e-mobility even more appealing to our customers. The new BMW round cells promise 20 percent higher energy density, 30 percent faster charging and at least 30 percent more range. And within just 10 minutes, enough energy for another 300 kilometres can be recharged. For the first time, the Gen6 high-voltage batteries also feature the latest 800-volt technology and enable bi-directional charging. Compared to the current fifth generation, we will reduce the cost of the high voltage battery by 40-50 percent, on a comparable electric range basis. The electronics architecture has also been completely redesigned. Going forward, its four high-performance computers will control key customer functionalities. For example driving dynamics, automated driving and infotainment. These “super-brains” deliver more than 20 times the in-vehicle computing power than current systems. This makes our models future-proof for software and function updates, as well as new AI features. We have also greatly simplified the electrical system, dividing it into four zones, with intelligent control. 600 metres less wiring, a 30 percent reduction in weight and a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency are just some of the improvements we will achieve with this. And, of course, we are also harnessing technical opportunities to take driving dynamics to a whole new level. The BMW Vision Driving Experience showcases the potential of the technologies introduced in the NEUE KLASSE. We are pushing driving dynamics to its physical limits. This highly emotional driving machine will thrill more than just BMW fans. The VDX is the most powerful development prototype BMW has ever built.

Developing colour and material schemes is an independent discipline within the MINI Design Studio.

The woven textiles are not only visually appealing, but also offer an attractive tactile experience. The woven structure specially developed for the new MINI model family is a unique selling point, setting it apart from the competition. It also offers extensive customisation potential, as new colours and patterns can be easily introduced.\n\nColours and materials harmoniously combined.The headrests of the new sports seats in the John Cooper Works Trim also feature an exclusive 2D woven surface that extends into the shoulder area.

For example, British Racing Green, the iconic colour closely associated with the brand’s motorsport tradition, is interpreted as Dark Petrol in the new MINI Aceman interior. Favoured Trim picks up on the elegant colour tone in the woven surfaces of the dashboard and door trim as well as in the seat accents.

The blueprints for the various surface textures used in the new MINI model family are based on influences that the design team draws from nature and science. This could be the grain on wood or rock, for example – but it could just as easily be a satellite photo of the earth, where fields, bodies of water or mountains can be seen as graphics with the appropriate resolution and provide inspiration for new grain patterns and structures.

The clear and minimalist design language creates a modern, cosy feel in the redesigned interior. The new colour and material scheme makes an important contribution to this: innovative materials, fresh colours and new patterns create a brand-typical feeling that transforms the interior into a feel-good place.Munich. Developing colour and material schemes is an independent discipline within the MINI Design Studio. The interplay of newly developed patterns, colours, small design details and the use of innovative materials creates a particularly harmonious, homey ambience in the new MINI model interiors. Drawing inspiration from fashion, art, architecture and modern furniture design, completely new design worlds, still maintaining links to the rich tradition of iconic MINI design, emerge.\n\nA key and consistent feature of the colour and material design for the new MINI model family is their particular attention to detail. It can be seen and sensed in every equipment variant. The colour scheme, choice of materials, visual and tactile elements combine to create an immersive and typical MINI overall experience.\n\nInnovative materials offer new design possibilities.One particular highlight is the innovative 2D weaving process used in the production of interior surfaces made from recycled polyester. The dashboards and door panels designed in this way create a sense of warmth and cosiness. The weaving process offers new design possibilities in terms of colouring and structure. It enables a dual-colour design with a particularly striking sense of depth. This comes about when the lower textile layer’s colour subtly shines through the upper one. This technique, inspired by sneaker design and meticulously refined, gives the surfaces a visual complexity, bringing a high-quality and unique appearance to the interior.\n\n“The weaving process allows us to create unique dual-colour designs that bring a special aesthetic and atmosphere to the interior,” says Elena Schwörer, designer for materials and weaving. The woven textiles are not only visually appealing, but also offer an attractive tactile experience. The woven structure specially developed for the new MINI model family is a unique selling point, setting it apart from the competition. It also offers extensive customisation potential, as new colours and patterns can be easily introduced.\n\nColours and materials harmoniously combined.The headrests of the new sports seats in the John Cooper Works Trim also feature an exclusive 2D woven surface that extends into the shoulder area. The combination of high-quality materials and precisely coordinated colour tones generates a harmonious, modern appearance in the cockpit as well as an exceptionally homey character. The new Vibrant Silver accent colour is a nuanced set-off to the contrasting stitching on the steering wheel.\n\n“We wanted to use colours that respect the heritage of the brand and at the same time create a fresh, contemporary aesthetic,” explains Jeanette Ohlhäuser, colour designer at the MINI Design Studio. For example, British Racing Green, the iconic colour closely associated with the brand’s motorsport tradition, is interpreted as Dark Petrol in the new MINI Aceman interior. Favoured Trim picks up on the elegant colour tone in the woven surfaces of the dashboard and door trim as well as in the seat accents. Dark Petrol also harmonises particularly well with the Rebel Red exterior colour. This alternates between different shades of red and orange depending on how the light falls on it.\n\nPrecisely crafted structures for a special tactile experience.The overall feel plays just as central a role in the interior design of the new MINI model family as the colour scheme and visual appearance of the materials. The surface textures and graining, found on almost every plastic part in the interior, are also developed with the utmost precision. “It is important to us that the texture of the surfaces harmonises perfectly with the other materials, such as the woven fabric in the interior,” says Marlies Michel, designer of MINI graining. The blueprints for the various surface textures used in the new MINI model family are based on influences that the design team draws from nature and science. This could be the grain on wood or rock, for example – but it could just as easily be a satellite photo of the earth, where fields, bodies of water or mountains can be seen as graphics with the appropriate resolution and provide inspiration for new grain patterns and structures. The very subtle MINI grain developed in this way blends perfectly with the visually strong weave and serves as a link between all the materials in the vehicle interior.\n\nMany small individual elements form the parts of the equation that combines to form a harmonious, modern and high-quality overall picture. This extraordinary depth of detail once again emphasises the enormous leap forward in design that MINI has made with the new model generation.\n\nCorporate Communications"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

There was also plenty of reason for joy in numerous other racing series worldwide. The BMW Italia Ceccato Racing team impressively continued its successful streak in the Italian GT Championship with the BMW M4 GT3. In North America, things did not go as well as usual, but we were able to witness strong results of the BMW M4 GT4 in Asia and Australia. I congratulate all participants! Off the racetrack, our highlight was the presentation of the EVO models of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 at the Nürburgring. We look forward to being able to provide more details about the new BMW M4 GT4 model in just a few weeks on the sidelines of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps.\"\n\nItalian GT Championship (1st-2nd June): Podium for Klingmann/Dennis at Imola.\n\nThe Italian GT Championship visited Imola (ITA) for the second round of the Sprint Cup at the beginning of the month. There was a change in the line-up of BMW M works drivers for the Team BMW Italia Ceccato Racing #7 BMW M4 GT3 as Max Hesse (GER) was simultaneously competing in the 24h Nürburgring (GER), Jake Dennis (GBR) shared the cockpit with Jens Klingmann (GER) at Imola. The duo was successful in the second of the two races when Klingmann and Dennis finished second on the podium. The first run was difficult for the two, ending in 17th place. After contact, Klingmann had to make an unscheduled pitstop to change a tyre during the second stint.\n\nThe weekend was also successful for Pedro Ebrahim (BRA) and Federico Malvestiti (ITA), who compete in the Pro-Am class with the #8 BMW M4 GT3. In the first run on Saturday, they secured third place in their category. On Sunday, the duo then celebrated their second class win of the season.\n\nJapan Cup (8th-9th June): Opening victory for the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nAt the first race weekend of the Japan Cup at Sportsland SUGO (JPN) the YZ Racing team, with the #50 BMW M4 GT4 and drivers Yuki Fujii and Masaki Kano (both JPN), won the opening race. In the second run, the duo finished in third place and thus took the lead in the overall standings.\n\nIMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge (8th-9th June): Endurance race in Mid-Ohio.\n\nThe second 4-hour race of the season in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge took place at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course (USA) last weekend, however without the hoped-for podium successes for the BMW M Motorsport teams. The highest-placed crew was Turner Motorsport with the #95 BMW M4 GT4 and drivers Dillon Machavern and Robert Megennis (both USA) finishing in sixth place. In total, five BMW M4 GT4s were on the starting grid.\n\nAlso in Mid-Ohio, the VP Racing SportsCar Challenge held two races in which five BMW M4 GT4s competed. In the Split Decision Motorsports #88 car, Patrick Wilmot (USA) narrowly missed the podium in the GSX class, finishing fourth in both races.\n\nBritish GT Championship (25th-26th May): BMW M4 GT3 in the top six at Donington.\n\nAt the third round of the British GT Championship at Donington Park (GBR), there was a top-six finish for the BMW M4 GT3. BMW M works driver Dan Harper (GBR) and his teammate Michael Johnston (GBR) finished sixth in the Century Motorsport #14 car.\n\nTheir teammates Lewis Plato and Carl Cavers (both GBR) finished twelfth in the #22 BMW M4 GT3. That was equivalent to fourth place in the GT3SA class. BMW M works driver Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and his driving colleague John Ferguson (GBR) saw the checkered flag in the #15 BMW M4 GT3 from Team RAM Racing in 17th place. In the GT4PA class, Ian Gough and Tom Wrigley (both GBR) in the Century Motorsport #29 BMW M4 GT4 finished fourth.\n\nSuper GT Series (1st-2nd June): Endurance race at Suzuka.\n\nAt the third season round of the Japanese Super GT Series at Suzuka (JPN), another endurance race was held. Team Studie was again supported by BMW M works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN). In the #7 BMW M4 GT3, he alternated with Niklas Krütten (GER) and Seiji Ara (JPN). The trio started from eighth on the grid and crossed the finish line in seventh place after 85 laps.\n\nGT4 Australia (1st-2nd June): BMW M4 GT4 successful in Australia.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 is also successful down under, namely in GT4 Australia. There, the BMW M Motorsport teams are regular guests on the various podiums. That was also the case at the second season round at the beginning of the month at The Bend Motorsport Park near Adelaide (AUS). The highest-placed BMW M Motorsport driver in both races was Tim Leahey (AUS) in the #22 BMW M4 GT4 from Team Central West Prestige. In the first race, he finished third in the highest class, the Silver category. In the second race, he narrowly missed the podium with fourth in his class.\n\nTwo class victories were celebrated by Jacob Lawrence (AUS) in the #32 car from Randall Racing in the Am category. In addition, there was a third place on the class podium for the #3 BMW M4 GT4 from Thunder Buddies Racing, driven by Ryder Quinn and Steve Jakic (both AUS / Pro-Am), as well as the #33 car from Randall Racing (Am), in which Jamie Augustine and Peter Lawrence (both AUS) took turns.\n\nBTCC (25th-26th May / 8th-9th June): Victories at Snetterton and Thruxton.\n\nTwo events were on the schedule in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in recent weeks. At the end of May, it was the third season round at Snetterton (GBR), and last weekend, round four followed at Thruxton (GBR). BMW drivers were once again extremely successful.\n\nAt Snetterton, Jake Hill (GBR) from Team Laser Tools Racing with MB Motorsport crowned himself \"King of the Hill\". He defied the very changeable weather conditions and was the star of the weekend. With the #24 BMW 330e M Sport, Hill was not only the fastest in qualifying but also won the first two of the three races. Not even a time penalty prevented him from reaching the finish with a large lead. In the third run, which became a tyre lottery due to drying track conditions, Hill led the field for a long time on rain tyres, but then the competition on slicks had the advantage, and he finished ninth in the end. Teammate Bobby Thompson (GBR) completed a BMW one-two result in the first race, finishing second in the #19 car on the podium.\n\nAt Thruxton, Hill repeated the feat of winning the first two of the three races. That gave him four victories from the last six races. In the third race of the day, Hill managed fifth place, which with 164 points now puts him in second place in the drivers' standings – just five points behind the leader. There were no more podium places for the BMW teams at Thruxton. Adam Morgan (GBR) finished fourth in the last race and twice in eighth place before that. Colin Turkington was twice seventh and once ninth.

There was also plenty of reason for joy in numerous other racing series worldwide. The BMW Italia Ceccato Racing team impressively continued its successful streak in the Italian GT Championship with the BMW M4 GT3. In North America, things did not go as well as usual, but we were able to witness strong results of the BMW M4 GT4 in Asia and Australia. I congratulate all participants! Off the racetrack, our highlight was the presentation of the EVO models of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 at the Nürburgring. We look forward to being able to provide more details about the new BMW M4 GT4 model in just a few weeks on the sidelines of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps.\"\n\nItalian GT Championship (1st-2nd June): Podium for Klingmann/Dennis at Imola.\n\nThe Italian GT Championship visited Imola (ITA) for the second round of the Sprint Cup at the beginning of the month. There was a change in the line-up of BMW M works drivers for the Team BMW Italia Ceccato Racing #7 BMW M4 GT3 as Max Hesse (GER) was simultaneously competing in the 24h Nürburgring (GER), Jake Dennis (GBR) shared the cockpit with Jens Klingmann (GER) at Imola. The duo was successful in the second of the two races when Klingmann and Dennis finished second on the podium. The first run was difficult for the two, ending in 17th place. After contact, Klingmann had to make an unscheduled pitstop to change a tyre during the second stint.\n\nThe weekend was also successful for Pedro Ebrahim (BRA) and Federico Malvestiti (ITA), who compete in the Pro-Am class with the #8 BMW M4 GT3. In the first run on Saturday, they secured third place in their category. On Sunday, the duo then celebrated their second class win of the season.\n\nJapan Cup (8th-9th June): Opening victory for the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nAt the first race weekend of the Japan Cup at Sportsland SUGO (JPN) the YZ Racing team, with the #50 BMW M4 GT4 and drivers Yuki Fujii and Masaki Kano (both JPN), won the opening race. In the second run, the duo finished in third place and thus took the lead in the overall standings.\n\nIMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge (8th-9th June): Endurance race in Mid-Ohio.\n\nThe second 4-hour race of the season in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge took place at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course (USA) last weekend, however without the hoped-for podium successes for the BMW M Motorsport teams. The highest-placed crew was Turner Motorsport with the #95 BMW M4 GT4 and drivers Dillon Machavern and Robert Megennis (both USA) finishing in sixth place. In total, five BMW M4 GT4s were on the starting grid.\n\nAlso in Mid-Ohio, the VP Racing SportsCar Challenge held two races in which five BMW M4 GT4s competed. In the Split Decision Motorsports #88 car, Patrick Wilmot (USA) narrowly missed the podium in the GSX class, finishing fourth in both races.\n\nBritish GT Championship (25th-26th May): BMW M4 GT3 in the top six at Donington.\n\nAt the third round of the British GT Championship at Donington Park (GBR), there was a top-six finish for the BMW M4 GT3. BMW M works driver Dan Harper (GBR) and his teammate Michael Johnston (GBR) finished sixth in the Century Motorsport #14 car.\n\nTheir teammates Lewis Plato and Carl Cavers (both GBR) finished twelfth in the #22 BMW M4 GT3. That was equivalent to fourth place in the GT3SA class. BMW M works driver Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and his driving colleague John Ferguson (GBR) saw the checkered flag in the #15 BMW M4 GT3 from Team RAM Racing in 17th place. In the GT4PA class, Ian Gough and Tom Wrigley (both GBR) in the Century Motorsport #29 BMW M4 GT4 finished fourth.\n\nSuper GT Series (1st-2nd June): Endurance race at Suzuka.\n\nAt the third season round of the Japanese Super GT Series at Suzuka (JPN), another endurance race was held. Team Studie was again supported by BMW M works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN). In the #7 BMW M4 GT3, he alternated with Niklas Krütten (GER) and Seiji Ara (JPN). The trio started from eighth on the grid and crossed the finish line in seventh place after 85 laps.\n\nGT4 Australia (1st-2nd June): BMW M4 GT4 successful in Australia.\n\nThe BMW M4 GT4 is also successful down under, namely in GT4 Australia. There, the BMW M Motorsport teams are regular guests on the various podiums. That was also the case at the second season round at the beginning of the month at The Bend Motorsport Park near Adelaide (AUS). The highest-placed BMW M Motorsport driver in both races was Tim Leahey (AUS) in the #22 BMW M4 GT4 from Team Central West Prestige. In the first race, he finished third in the highest class, the Silver category. In the second race, he narrowly missed the podium with fourth in his class.\n\nTwo class victories were celebrated by Jacob Lawrence (AUS) in the #32 car from Randall Racing in the Am category. In addition, there was a third place on the class podium for the #3 BMW M4 GT4 from Thunder Buddies Racing, driven by Ryder Quinn and Steve Jakic (both AUS / Pro-Am), as well as the #33 car from Randall Racing (Am), in which Jamie Augustine and Peter Lawrence (both AUS) took turns.\n\nBTCC (25th-26th May / 8th-9th June): Victories at Snetterton and Thruxton.\n\nTwo events were on the schedule in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in recent weeks. At the end of May, it was the third season round at Snetterton (GBR), and last weekend, round four followed at Thruxton (GBR). BMW drivers were once again extremely successful.\n\nAt Snetterton, Jake Hill (GBR) from Team Laser Tools Racing with MB Motorsport crowned himself \"King of the Hill\". He defied the very changeable weather conditions and was the star of the weekend. With the #24 BMW 330e M Sport, Hill was not only the fastest in qualifying but also won the first two of the three races. Not even a time penalty prevented him from reaching the finish with a large lead. In the third run, which became a tyre lottery due to drying track conditions, Hill led the field for a long time on rain tyres, but then the competition on slicks had the advantage, and he finished ninth in the end. Teammate Bobby Thompson (GBR) completed a BMW one-two result in the first race, finishing second in the #19 car on the podium.\n\nAt Thruxton, Hill repeated the feat of winning the first two of the three races. That gave him four victories from the last six races. In the third race of the day, Hill managed fifth place, which with 164 points now puts him in second place in the drivers' standings – just five points behind the leader. There were no more podium places for the BMW teams at Thruxton. Adam Morgan (GBR) finished fourth in the last race and twice in eighth place before that. Colin Turkington was twice seventh and once ninth. He is in fourth place in the drivers' standings."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport News, 11th June 2024."}]}

Right in the middle of it all is BMW M Motorsport and two pairs of racing brothers navigating the tension between family and competition on the track. This one-hour documentary vividly and emotionally captures June 2024 and its legendary endurance events at the Nürburgring (GER), Le Mans (FRA), and Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). Central to the story are Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde (both RSA), as well as Dries and Laurens Vanthoor (both BEL). The film has been available since 14th April 2025 on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, YouTube Movies, and Apple TV.\n\nThe tight scheduling of the world’s three biggest 24-hour races within a single month in June 2024 pushed manufacturers, teams, cars, and drivers to their absolute limits. Produced by ffilmworx on behalf of BMW M Motorsport, the documentary focuses on two main storylines: the behind-the-scenes perspective of BMW M Motorsport and its staff, who rode a wave of highs and lows on the path to podium finishes at all three races, and the dynamic between BMW M works drivers Sheldon van der Linde and Dries Vanthoor and their brothers – Kelvin van der Linde (then racing for Lamborghini and Lexus) and Laurens Vanthoor (Porsche) – both on and off the racetrack.\n\nThe film is being released just in time for June 2025, when all participants will face the same challenges once again – only this time, even more intense.

I remember that month very clearly – it was mentally and emotionally demanding for me and for everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport.

It also gives a beautiful look into the relationships between the van der Linde and Vanthoor brothers.

BMW is partner of Frieze Seoul 2025: From 3 to 6 September, the art fair will bring 120 galleries from 30 countries to the COEX in the Gangnam district. Two anniversaries of the BMW Group will be celebrated with a multifaceted collaboration with renowned Korean artist Lee Kun-Yong: 30 years of BMW Korea and 50 years of the BMW Art Car Collection. Another highlight of this year's programme is the third edition of Frieze Music Seoul on 5 September, featuring a live performance by Korean RnB artist Crush, organised in collaboration with BMW. BMW will once again provide a shuttle service for VIP guests at the fair.\n\nLee Kun-Yong, born in 1942 in Sariwon (now North Korea), is considered one of Korea's most influential avant-garde artists. His thoughts on painting focus on the process, and the figurative becomes a medium through the performative use of Lee's body. His iconic ‘Bodyscape’ series consists of repetitive, precise gestures that depict the movement of the body in space on the canvas, creating abstract worlds from the artist's physical traces. Lee Kun-Yong was a co-founder of the experimental artist group ‘Space & Time,’ which developed into a core formation of the Korean avant-garde. He has expanded the boundaries of artistic expression through experiments with abstraction, performance, and the use of the human body as a medium and message.\n\nFor his collaboration with BMW, Lee Kun-Yong has designed a unique wrap for the fully electric BMW i7, which will be exhibited at Frieze Seoul. He has further developed his ‘Bodyscapes’ series for this purpose, transforming the vehicle into a mobile canvas that not only moves through space but also embodies it. Engaging with the design and technology of the BMW i7, Lee Kun-Yong's work reflects the precision and responsiveness inherent in the dialogue between driver and car, drawing parallels to his own artistic practice. By exploring the driving experience through various perspectives, he artfully creates a dynamic interplay of figurative and monochrome areas, evoking a sense of proximity and distance. \"I firmly believe that art can be the bridge between different objects, different people and even different perspectives,\" says Lee Kun-Yong. \"Through this new collaboration, I hope to create new encounters and connections through art, and I am excited to see how this link between art and technology will develop.\"\n\nOn 4 September at 1 p.m., Lee Kun-Yong will give one of his iconic live performances, creating one new canvas. Inspired by his work on the BMW i7, he translates his thoughts on mobility, time and space into physical expression: for him, movement is not just speed. It is perception, interaction with the environment and the intimate dialogue between body and machine.\n\nIn 2025, BMW celebrates 50 years of BMW Art Cars with a global exhibition programme and diverse artistic initiatives – the BMW Art Car World Tour. Since 1975, the BMW Group has provided artists with a playground for their fascination with automobiles through the BMW Art Cars: art and design, technology and innovation, racing and engineering. The collection of 20 BMW Art Cars now forms the essence of the global cultural engagement with over a hundred initiatives in the fields of contemporary art, music, film and design. Since its invention almost 140 years ago, artists around the world have engaged with the automobile in both critical and euphoric ways. The BMW Art Car series contributes significantly to this inspiring dialogue and is an anchor point for further unique artistic collaborations on vehicles, such as the one with Lee Kun-Yong. In addition to the BMW i7, miniatures of 18 BMW Art Cars from the collection are on display in the BMW Lounge as historical references.\n\nThe collaboration with Lee Kun-Yong is already the third large-scale artistic initiative at Frieze Seoul and testifies to BMW Korea's deep-rooted commitment to innovation, future orientation and emotional experiences. Since its foundation in 1995, the company has had a large presence in South Korea – including the Incheon Cheongna Development Centre and the Driving Centre on Yeongjong Island. South Korea is the BMW Group's fifth-largest market, and in 2023 and 2024, BMW ranked first among imported automotive brands. BMW Korea will celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2025 with numerous events under the motto ‘Joy of Driving. Innovation for Tomorrow.’\n\nFrieze MusicTo celebrate their long-standing partnership, BMW and Frieze are jointly presenting another edition of Frieze Music in Seoul. Crush will perform on 5 September. Since releasing his debut single in 2012, he has established himself as one of Korea’s most innovative artists – a multi-talented performer and producer blending pop, R&B, and hip hop. Frieze Music explores the intersection between music and art to create a space for dialogue. Artists are given the opportunity to showcase their craft through song, creativity and exchange with other artists in a unique performance. The joint initiative between BMW and Frieze, which was launched during the first Frieze in Los Angeles in 2019, has already brought together a variety of musicians, including Moses Sumney, Caroline Polachek, Nilüfer Yanya and Loyle Carner.\n\nPlease note that an admission ticket is required to visit the BMW Lounge:\n\nArtistically designed BMW i7 by Lee Kun-Yong 3–6 SeptemberBMW Lounge, Hall CCOEX, 513 Yeongdong-daero,Gangnam-gu\n\nPrivate ViewWednesday, 3 September: 2:00 pmFollowed by a champagne toast(by invitation only)\n\nLive performance by Lee Kun-YongThursday, 4 September: 1:00 pm Media accreditation and interview requests (limited capacity)\n\nOpening hoursWednesday, 3 September: 11:00 am to 7:00 pm (by invitation only)Thursday, 4 September: 11:00 am to 7:00 pm (by invitation and advance ticket only; open to the public from 3:00 pm)Friday and Saturday, 5/6 September: 11:00 am to 7:00 pm\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW is partner of Frieze Seoul 2025: From 3 to 6 September, the art fair will bring 120 galleries from 30 countries to the COEX in the Gangnam district.

BMW is partner of Frieze Seoul 2025: From 3 to 6 September, the art fair will bring 120 galleries from 30 countries to the COEX in the Gangnam district. Two anniversaries of the BMW Group will be celebrated with a multifaceted collaboration with renowned Korean artist Lee Kun-Yong: 30 years of BMW Korea and 50 years of the BMW Art Car Collection. Another highlight of this year's programme is the third edition of Frieze Music Seoul on 5 September, featuring a live performance by Korean RnB artist Crush, organised in collaboration with BMW. BMW will once again provide a shuttle service for VIP guests at the fair.\n\nLee Kun-Yong, born in 1942 in Sariwon (now North Korea), is considered one of Korea's most influential avant-garde artists. His thoughts on painting focus on the process, and the figurative becomes a medium through the performative use of Lee's body. His iconic ‘Bodyscape’ series consists of repetitive, precise gestures that depict the movement of the body in space on the canvas, creating abstract worlds from the artist's physical traces. Lee Kun-Yong was a co-founder of the experimental artist group ‘Space & Time,’ which developed into a core formation of the Korean avant-garde. He has expanded the boundaries of artistic expression through experiments with abstraction, performance, and the use of the human body as a medium and message.\n\nFor his collaboration with BMW, Lee Kun-Yong has designed a unique wrap for the fully electric BMW i7, which will be exhibited at Frieze Seoul. He has further developed his ‘Bodyscapes’ series for this purpose, transforming the vehicle into a mobile canvas that not only moves through space but also embodies it. Engaging with the design and technology of the BMW i7, Lee Kun-Yong's work reflects the precision and responsiveness inherent in the dialogue between driver and car, drawing parallels to his own artistic practice. By exploring the driving experience through various perspectives, he artfully creates a dynamic interplay of figurative and monochrome areas, evoking a sense of proximity and distance. \"I firmly believe that art can be the bridge between different objects, different people and even different perspectives,\" says Lee Kun-Yong. \"Through this new collaboration, I hope to create new encounters and connections through art, and I am excited to see how this link between art and technology will develop.\"\n\nOn 4 September at 1 p.m., Lee Kun-Yong will give one of his iconic live performances, creating one new canvas. Inspired by his work on the BMW i7, he translates his thoughts on mobility, time and space into physical expression: for him, movement is not just speed. It is perception, interaction with the environment and the intimate dialogue between body and machine.\n\nIn 2025, BMW celebrates 50 years of BMW Art Cars with a global exhibition programme and diverse artistic initiatives – the BMW Art Car World Tour. Since 1975, the BMW Group has provided artists with a playground for their fascination with automobiles through the BMW Art Cars: art and design, technology and innovation, racing and engineering. The collection of 20 BMW Art Cars now forms the essence of the global cultural engagement with over a hundred initiatives in the fields of contemporary art, music, film and design. Since its invention almost 140 years ago, artists around the world have engaged with the automobile in both critical and euphoric ways. The BMW Art Car series contributes significantly to this inspiring dialogue and is an anchor point for further unique artistic collaborations on vehicles, such as the one with Lee Kun-Yong. In addition to the BMW i7, miniatures of 18 BMW Art Cars from the collection are on display in the BMW Lounge as historical references.\n\nThe collaboration with Lee Kun-Yong is already the third large-scale artistic initiative at Frieze Seoul and testifies to BMW Korea's deep-rooted commitment to innovation, future orientation and emotional experiences. Since its foundation in 1995, the company has had a large presence in South Korea – including the Incheon Cheongna Development Centre and the Driving Centre on Yeongjong Island. South Korea is the BMW Group's fifth-largest market, and in 2023 and 2024, BMW ranked first among imported automotive brands. BMW Korea will celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2025 with numerous events under the motto ‘Joy of Driving. Innovation for Tomorrow.’\n\nFrieze MusicTo celebrate their long-standing partnership, BMW and Frieze are jointly presenting another edition of Frieze Music in Seoul.
