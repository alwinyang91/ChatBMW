The 9th BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy began with a beautiful African sunrise. After breaking camp, the riders packed their gear into bags, which were later transported to the next camp. As is tradition, 2 or 3 teams were randomly selected to handle the task of loading the bags onto the transportation truck. After a hearty breakfast, the moment everyone had been eagerly anticipating arrived. Stefanie Grund, Senior Project Manager of the event, waved the checkered flag, signaling the start of this year's adventure riding event. At 7:45 am local time, Team Brazil, the International Female Team, and Female Team Japan crossed the start line to cheers from the crowd.\n\nThe competitors formed groups of 7-9 motorcycles and, guided by their appointed Marshals, embarked on the first day and first Special Challenge. Only a few kilometers away from the Midgard Country Estate Lodge, still within its perimeter, the riders faced their first Special Challenge.\n\nDay 1, Special Challenge 1: The Namibia Welcome Trial. Near the ruins of an abandoned copper mine, the participants lined up their bikes at the starting point. The first rider’s departure marked the start of the timing for the challenge, with the other two riders (or one for a female team) following after a 5-second interval. Navigating a narrow, short trail through marked gates, the riders tackled sand, steps, drops, and tight turns. At the end, they parked their bikes side by side and rushed to the mine’s closed entrance to ring a bell. The timer stopped when the third rider hit the bell – an ideal warm-up for both the teams and the Marshals.\n\nAlthough the trial seemed easy initially, many riders were caught by surprise by its narrow passes. Rider Yasuhiro Maehara (212) from Team Japan said before the start of the challenge, “I think it’s very easy, and we’re really excited to get in there!” After completing the challenge with only a few deductions, he added, “I’m sorry. It was not so easy. I had to put my foot down a few times. The short corner and the deep sand caught me off-guard.”\n\nRider Dev Venkatesh (202) of Team India, said: “This was the best welcome for a special challenge for me. It is the first time I ride the 1300 GS off-road and it felt incredible. Smooth like butter. The challenge was short but very technical. You don’t have room for improvement, you have to stick to your lines. But we completed the trial without any mistakes and did a clean run, so we’re very excited to learn about the results.”\n\nRider Sunghee Kim (301) of Female Team South Korea, said: “Although it was an easy course, we had a little bit of hard time. But we didn’t drop the bike, which was great. And we feel very welcome,” quoting the name of the special challenge.\n\nLeaving behind this historic estate's lush, serene landscape along the Swakop River, known for its acacia woodlands, wildlife sightings, and scenic views, the riders headed west. The nearly 200-kilometer ride offered a real warm-up, with constantly changing terrain from hardpacked dirt to loose gravel and deep sand. The magnificence of Namibia began to unfold, with rock formations dating back nearly 700 million years. The riders experienced a sense of isolation, encountering little traffic along the way while staying alert for freely roaming cattle and wildlife crossings.\n\nNamibia’s rainy season typically begins in December and can last until April, but this past year, the last rain fell quite early, making the riding conditions extremely dusty. The lack of wind didn’t help, leaving both riders and motorcycles looking as though they’d been on an adventure of epic proportions. This added an element of danger, as the old Enduro saying warns: \"If there is dust and you can’t see the road, there will be a rock right in front of you.\" However, it was remarkable to see nature thriving despite the dry conditions, with trees growing on rocks, proving that even a little dirt is enough for a seed to sprout.\n\nAfter the long and dusty ride, the riders arrived in Omaruru, a charming town known for its vineyards, art scene, and cultural heritage. Omaruru is home to local wineries, such as Kristall Kellerei, Namibia's only wine estate, which produces unique wines from specially adapted grape varieties. The town also boasts art galleries and the Omaruru Artist's Trail, where local artists display and sell their work.\n\nAfter a much needed refueling and lunch break, the riders were ready for their first true taste of Africa. Just a few kilometers from their afternoon stop, the second special challenge awaited them.\n\nDay 1, Special Challenge 2: The AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge. The trail led to a dry riverbed – synonymous with one thing: very deep sand. The riders had to navigate an extremely sandy riverbed and complete a marked course while being timed. It soon became clear why it was called \"the AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge,\" as they blasted through the sand, revving their engines to their limit, struggling to stay on their bikes and avoid getting stuck in the river bed. This was certainly no warm-up exercise and the roaring of the engines could be heard for many kilometers away.\n\nRider Marion Linder (331) of the Female Team Germany, said: “This was a very demanding challenge. The sand was very deep, but we got a real taste of Africa. In fact I even got it between my teeth.”\n\nRider Francisco Leyva (112) of Team Mexico, after a phenomenal performance in the deep sand, was asked how many years of sand training the team had, and he said: “Four days. That’s all the time we got with this bike. We don’t know and we don’t care about the results. Me and my friends are smiling, and that’s the best outcome.”\n\nThe day’s final challenge took the riders on a detour through a phenomenal cluster of jeep tracks with challenging uphills covered by loose rocks and deep sand, leading them to the Ai Aiba Rock Painting Lodge. The camp, nestled amid imposing granite boulders at the foothills of the Erongo Mountain range, is rich in history. These ancient rock formations are the eroded remains of a volcanic complex around 130 million years old and are famous for countless rock painting sites, making Ai Aiba a mystical exploration of nature.\n\nDuring today’s route, the riders had also the chance to take pictures for the third Special Challenge, the Photo Challenge. This year, their pictures will be judged by BMW officials, and the scores will count towards tomorrow’s results.\n\nCompetitors and crew were rewarded with a beautiful African sunset as they waited for the day’s results\n\nRider Ruhan De Villiers (233) Team South Africa: “This was a very nice first day. Nice gravel roads with sandy bits in between. I think the two challenges went well for us as a team, and from what I can see, it will only get more challenging from tomorrow. Definitely the last section on our way here, was the highlight of the day. Back home, I have an R 1200 GS Rallye, and I love the 1300. I think I will try to buy one when I return.”\n\nRider Karen Weckx (351), Female Team Benelux: “It was a fantastic day. It was tough, but it was fantastic. Beautiful scenery, beautiful tracks, especially in the afternoon, the more technical riding and that dry river crossing, I loved it. Our team did really well during the first challenge, but we struggled a lot in the second. So we’re curious about the results.”\n\nBMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024, Namibia.\n\nDay One overall standings:\n\n1. South Africa, 41 points\n\n3. International Team, 30\n\n10.

But we completed the trial without any mistakes and did a clean run, so we’re very excited to learn about the results.”\n\nRider Sunghee Kim (301) of Female Team South Korea, said: “Although it was an easy course, we had a little bit of hard time. But we didn’t drop the bike, which was great. And we feel very welcome,” quoting the name of the special challenge.\n\nLeaving behind this historic estate's lush, serene landscape along the Swakop River, known for its acacia woodlands, wildlife sightings, and scenic views, the riders headed west. The nearly 200-kilometer ride offered a real warm-up, with constantly changing terrain from hardpacked dirt to loose gravel and deep sand. The magnificence of Namibia began to unfold, with rock formations dating back nearly 700 million years. The riders experienced a sense of isolation, encountering little traffic along the way while staying alert for freely roaming cattle and wildlife crossings.\n\nNamibia’s rainy season typically begins in December and can last until April, but this past year, the last rain fell quite early, making the riding conditions extremely dusty. The lack of wind didn’t help, leaving both riders and motorcycles looking as though they’d been on an adventure of epic proportions. This added an element of danger, as the old Enduro saying warns: \"If there is dust and you can’t see the road, there will be a rock right in front of you.\" However, it was remarkable to see nature thriving despite the dry conditions, with trees growing on rocks, proving that even a little dirt is enough for a seed to sprout.\n\nAfter the long and dusty ride, the riders arrived in Omaruru, a charming town known for its vineyards, art scene, and cultural heritage. Omaruru is home to local wineries, such as Kristall Kellerei, Namibia's only wine estate, which produces unique wines from specially adapted grape varieties. The town also boasts art galleries and the Omaruru Artist's Trail, where local artists display and sell their work.\n\nAfter a much needed refueling and lunch break, the riders were ready for their first true taste of Africa. Just a few kilometers from their afternoon stop, the second special challenge awaited them.\n\nDay 1, Special Challenge 2: The AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge. The trail led to a dry riverbed – synonymous with one thing: very deep sand. The riders had to navigate an extremely sandy riverbed and complete a marked course while being timed. It soon became clear why it was called \"the AKRAPOVIČ Enduro Challenge,\" as they blasted through the sand, revving their engines to their limit, struggling to stay on their bikes and avoid getting stuck in the river bed. This was certainly no warm-up exercise and the roaring of the engines could be heard for many kilometers away.\n\nRider Marion Linder (331) of the Female Team Germany, said: “This was a very demanding challenge. The sand was very deep, but we got a real taste of Africa. In fact I even got it between my teeth.”\n\nRider Francisco Leyva (112) of Team Mexico, after a phenomenal performance in the deep sand, was asked how many years of sand training the team had, and he said: “Four days. That’s all the time we got with this bike. We don’t know and we don’t care about the results. Me and my friends are smiling, and that’s the best outcome.”\n\nThe day’s final challenge took the riders on a detour through a phenomenal cluster of jeep tracks with challenging uphills covered by loose rocks and deep sand, leading them to the Ai Aiba Rock Painting Lodge. The camp, nestled amid imposing granite boulders at the foothills of the Erongo Mountain range, is rich in history. These ancient rock formations are the eroded remains of a volcanic complex around 130 million years old and are famous for countless rock painting sites, making Ai Aiba a mystical exploration of nature.\n\nDuring today’s route, the riders had also the chance to take pictures for the third Special Challenge, the Photo Challenge. This year, their pictures will be judged by BMW officials, and the scores will count towards tomorrow’s results.\n\nCompetitors and crew were rewarded with a beautiful African sunset as they waited for the day’s results\n\nRider Ruhan De Villiers (233) Team South Africa: “This was a very nice first day. Nice gravel roads with sandy bits in between. I think the two challenges went well for us as a team, and from what I can see, it will only get more challenging from tomorrow. Definitely the last section on our way here, was the highlight of the day. Back home, I have an R 1200 GS Rallye, and I love the 1300. I think I will try to buy one when I return.”\n\nRider Karen Weckx (351), Female Team Benelux: “It was a fantastic day. It was tough, but it was fantastic. Beautiful scenery, beautiful tracks, especially in the afternoon, the more technical riding and that dry river crossing, I loved it. Our team did really well during the first challenge, but we struggled a lot in the second. So we’re curious about the results.”\n\nBMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024, Namibia.\n\nDay One overall standings:\n\n1. South Africa, 41 points\n\n3. International Team, 30\n\n10.

The 9th BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy began with a beautiful African sunrise. After breaking camp, the riders packed their gear into bags, which were later transported to the next camp. As is tradition, 2 or 3 teams were randomly selected to handle the task of loading the bags onto the transportation truck. After a hearty breakfast, the moment everyone had been eagerly anticipating arrived. Stefanie Grund, Senior Project Manager of the event, waved the checkered flag, signaling the start of this year's adventure riding event. At 7:45 am local time, Team Brazil, the International Female Team, and Female Team Japan crossed the start line to cheers from the crowd.\n\nThe competitors formed groups of 7-9 motorcycles and, guided by their appointed Marshals, embarked on the first day and first Special Challenge. Only a few kilometers away from the Midgard Country Estate Lodge, still within its perimeter, the riders faced their first Special Challenge.\n\nDay 1, Special Challenge 1: The Namibia Welcome Trial. Near the ruins of an abandoned copper mine, the participants lined up their bikes at the starting point. The first rider’s departure marked the start of the timing for the challenge, with the other two riders (or one for a female team) following after a 5-second interval. Navigating a narrow, short trail through marked gates, the riders tackled sand, steps, drops, and tight turns. At the end, they parked their bikes side by side and rushed to the mine’s closed entrance to ring a bell. The timer stopped when the third rider hit the bell – an ideal warm-up for both the teams and the Marshals.\n\nAlthough the trial seemed easy initially, many riders were caught by surprise by its narrow passes. Rider Yasuhiro Maehara (212) from Team Japan said before the start of the challenge, “I think it’s very easy, and we’re really excited to get in there!” After completing the challenge with only a few deductions, he added, “I’m sorry. It was not so easy. I had to put my foot down a few times. The short corner and the deep sand caught me off-guard.”\n\nRider Dev Venkatesh (202) of Team India, said: “This was the best welcome for a special challenge for me. It is the first time I ride the 1300 GS off-road and it felt incredible. Smooth like butter. The challenge was short but very technical. You don’t have room for improvement, you have to stick to your lines. But we completed the trial without any mistakes and did a clean run, so we’re very excited to learn about the results.”\n\nRider Sunghee Kim (301) of Female Team South Korea, said: “Although it was an easy course, we had a little bit of hard time.

The BMW M135 vehicles were used, which thanks to technical refinements can be used as M Mixed Reality vehicles.\n\nThis includes very precise GPS positioning on the road surface in order to transfer position and movement to the virtual world. Every acceleration, every turn and every braking manoeuvre is transmitted to the virtual world without latency thanks to precise sensor technology and signal processing. Not only the movements of the vehicle are transmitted, but also those of the driver.\n\nThe technology for this is already integrated into the standardised in-vehicle systems of all BMW and BMW M automobiles. These systems are so precise that no additional sensors are required.\n\nAnother key element is the VR headset that the driver wears to experience the digital world. This headset must be connected to the vehicle's internal systems in order to synchronise movements and data in real time. Thanks to this equipment, various BMW M models can be used for BMW M Mixed Reality, regardless of the drive system. This includes vehicles with a conventional combustion engine such as the BMW M2 or BMW M4 as well as models with a fully electric powertrain such as the BMW i5 M60.

The BMW Group is expanding its revolutionary driving experience with BMW M Mixed Reality, which breaks down the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds through state-of-the-art VR/MR technologies. The vehicle itself becomes the controller - a unique 3D interaction between driver, vehicle and environment.\n\n\"Mixed reality\" refers to the fusion of of physical and digital worlds into a seamless experience. BMW M first presented mixed reality technology at the Web Summit in Lisbon in November 2022 and has been continuously developing it ever since.\n\nWith BMW M Mixed Reality, fans and first movers can immerse themselves in a digital world while physically sitting at the wheel of a BMW M vehicle and controlling it.\n\nFirst-ever multisensory multiplayer\n\nThe possibilities of virtual reality are boundless: On a secret mission, you enter the BMW M Garage and from there, you ascend to the top of the BMW M Rooftop Circuit. Surrounded by skyscrapers, two BMW M Mixed Reality customers now race against each other virtually in a multiplayer mode A new feature is that spectators with personified avatars can virtually watch the race live from the BMW M Mixed Reality Bridge. They do not have to be physically present in the area where the multiplayers are driving. They can be virtually connected using devices like the Meta Quest or Apple Vision Pro.\n\nBMW M Mixed Reality will be presented again in Lisbon this year. For BMW M fans, BMW M Mixed Reality has been available in the singleplayer mode since autumn 2023 as part of the BMW M Driving Experience in Maisach, the world's first driving experience for customers.\n\nFor BMW M fans, BMW M Mixed Reality has been available in the singleplayer mode since fall 2023 as part of the BMW M Driving Experience in Maisach, the world's first driving experience for customers. The pilot project began this year at the BMW M Performance Driving School in California, USA.\n\nMerging reality and the virtual world\n\nThe new BMW M Mixed Reality Rooftop Circuit was also a highlight at the presentation of BMW M Mixed Reality. Drivers had to evade virtual obstacles and collect BMW M coins in a shimmering metropolis. The BMW M135 vehicles were used, which thanks to technical refinements can be used as M Mixed Reality vehicles.\n\nThis includes very precise GPS positioning on the road surface in order to transfer position and movement to the virtual world. Every acceleration, every turn and every braking manoeuvre is transmitted to the virtual world without latency thanks to precise sensor technology and signal processing. Not only the movements of the vehicle are transmitted, but also those of the driver.\n\nThe technology for this is already integrated into the standardised in-vehicle systems of all BMW and BMW M automobiles. These systems are so precise that no additional sensors are required.\n\nAnother key element is the VR headset that the driver wears to experience the digital world. This headset must be connected to the vehicle's internal systems in order to synchronise movements and data in real time. Thanks to this equipment, various BMW M models can be used for BMW M Mixed Reality, regardless of the drive system. This includes vehicles with a conventional combustion engine such as the BMW M2 or BMW M4 as well as models with a fully electric powertrain such as the BMW i5 M60. In the future, BMW M can also imagine offering the new BMW M5 with M Mixed Reality. The technology is flexible and can be adapted to different vehicle platforms to provide a consistent and immersive mixed reality experience.\n\nDigital innovations for the driving experience\n\nBMW Group Mixed Reality is an answer to what future virtual experiences in the automotive sector could look like. At the current stage of development, it enables perfect controllability in every driving situation. Drifting will also be possible in the future, although no date has yet been set for when customers will be able to have this experience.\n\nMINI also benefits from the BMW Group Mixed Reality umbrella: There are also plans to offer customers a multi-sensory mixed reality driving experience.\n\nIn addition, further applications in the field of vehicle development and professional training are already being investigated. For example, there is potential as a valuable addition to existing simulator driving in the dynamic driving area, without compromising driving safety, or in the development of driver assistance systems. On existing racetracks, a Professional Track Trainer could in the future display content such as the ideal line and braking points to drivers in order to train them to drive even more precisely. Current AR headset technology is not yet accurate enough for this ambitious use case.\n\nIn the event of enquiries please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nChristophe König, Head of BMW M GmbH and BMW M Motorsport Communications\n\nAlexandra Landers, Head of Product and Brand Communication BMW\n\nInternet: \n\nIn 2023, the BMW Group sold over 2.55 million passenger vehicles and more than 209,000 motorcycles worldwide.

Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) is firmly back in winning ways. At the penultimate round of the 2024 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Estoril, Portugal, he secured a dominant pole position and won both main races by a wide margin with his ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s BMW M 1000 RR. This brings him one step closer to the World Championship title. Only in the Superpole race did he narrowly miss victory, finishing second by just 0.003 seconds behind championship rival Nicolo Bulega (ITA / Ducati) – the closest finish in the 35-year history of WorldSBK. Razgatlioglu now heads into the season finale next weekend (18th to 20th October) at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, with a 46-point lead. A total of 62 points are still up for grabs.\n\nHis teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) secured a place in the second row in Superpole, with his best race result being a hard-fought fifth place in Sunday’s second main race.\n\nFor the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, Garrett Gerloff (USA) and Scott Redding (GBR) fought their way forward after a difficult Superpole session. Gerloff stormed to a sixth-place finish in the first main race, while Redding climbed from 19th on the grid in the Superpole race to finish in the top ten.\n\nReactions after the Estoril round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This weekend, we made a huge step toward the title. I’m incredibly proud of the entire team. You can feel that the pressure is building, and the team has done an outstanding job. On Toprak’s side, they remained calm, approaching each race with a lot of focus. Toprak rode extremely smartly. He had the championship in mind but kept pushing. For Mickey, it was a very tough and emotional weekend. He fought his way through the weekend very well and finished with a well-deserved top-five result. We are very proud of him. At the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, it was really unfortunate that Garrett had to retire in the last race. He was on his way to a top-five finish as well. On Scott’s side, we saw small steps in the right direction. He had a great Superpole race, where he secured a top-ten finish. I think we can head to Jerez with a lot of confidence now. We are excited for the season finale!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 1 / R01: 1 / SP Race: 2 / R02: 1): “I am really happy today, especially with race two. We did not manage three wins this weekend, but almost, as it was very close in the Superpole race. There, I also used the race tyre because I thought that the Q tyre would drop at the end. I had incredible pace with the race tyre but when I saw the chequered flag I had lost the race. I was surprised that the Q tyre didn’t drop while my tyre started to spin a lot. Nicolo had a big advantage in the last corner and I kept fighting and it was very close. But we got good points for the championship and I won both long races. They are always more difficult because you need to manage the tyre and your pace. I did a very good job. To get the wins again after the big injury is really good for me and now we will see what happens at Jerez. I am pretty relaxed because I have a good points lead. I will just try to enjoy Jerez. I am not feeling stressed because I just need good results there. I don’t need to win at Jerez – and maybe I will win there, too. I know that Ducati is very strong there but we improved a lot after the test and I am ready to fight. if I just need a second position in the last race, that’s okay but I am focusing on winning again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 6 / R01: 7 / SP Race: 13 / R02: 5): “It has been of course a difficult weekend after what happened this week. I want to thank the entire team and BMW for supporting me because it was tough but there was no pressure from them. I wanted to ride. Friday was a day to forget but yesterday was not so bad. In Superpole, I had a good feeling and I scored some good points in race one. But it was a difficult long race and I didn’t feel fantastic. The in today’s Superpole race, I didn’t have a good feeling at all. I tried really hard but it just didn’t work. So for race two it was about to calm down a bit and starting from P11 I managed to have a good start and a good race. I had a strong pace, it was a nice and long battle, especially at the end with Andrea Iannone. We are fighting for sixth in the championship so I really wanted to stay in front of him. The bike felt really good and it was nice to finish fifth in race two. Now I think everyone can’t wait to go to Jerez and to have a fantastic weekend there after we have seen what Toprak did this weekend, being pretty close to the ultimate dream of BMW, and I’ll be ready to support him as much as I can.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 17 / R01: 6 / SP Race: 11 / R02: DNF): “It has been a bit of a disappointing day today. I tried to do my best again to get into the top nine in the Superpole race to give me a better start position for the race two. I had a good race with Scott and Michael but in the end none of us finished in the top nine so I had to start from the back again. I had a really good start, I felt really good but then had a technical problem and wasn’t able to finish the race. It was unfortunate because I think it could have been a good day pointswise. But anyway, I only have a couple of days to prepare for the next one and I feel good.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 19 / R01: 12 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 11): “Sunday was not so bad, honestly. This morning in warm up, we had miserable track conditions so I just did an outlap and a start. The Superpole race was okay. I felt that I had good speed to get into the top ten. We were fighting a lot, especially over the last few laps. It was really nice so I enjoyed this race. In race two I pushed again to try to finish in the top ten. I didn’t feel as good as in the Superpole race but I felt a lot better than on the other days. I was fighting and in the middle of the race I had some good rhythm but then I destroyed the rear tyre a bit so the last corner was really taking a lot of my lap time away.

For Mickey, it was a very tough and emotional weekend. He fought his way through the weekend very well and finished with a well-deserved top-five result. We are very proud of him. At the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, it was really unfortunate that Garrett had to retire in the last race. He was on his way to a top-five finish as well. On Scott’s side, we saw small steps in the right direction. He had a great Superpole race, where he secured a top-ten finish. I think we can head to Jerez with a lot of confidence now. We are excited for the season finale!”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 1 / R01: 1 / SP Race: 2 / R02: 1): “I am really happy today, especially with race two. We did not manage three wins this weekend, but almost, as it was very close in the Superpole race. There, I also used the race tyre because I thought that the Q tyre would drop at the end. I had incredible pace with the race tyre but when I saw the chequered flag I had lost the race. I was surprised that the Q tyre didn’t drop while my tyre started to spin a lot. Nicolo had a big advantage in the last corner and I kept fighting and it was very close. But we got good points for the championship and I won both long races. They are always more difficult because you need to manage the tyre and your pace. I did a very good job. To get the wins again after the big injury is really good for me and now we will see what happens at Jerez. I am pretty relaxed because I have a good points lead. I will just try to enjoy Jerez. I am not feeling stressed because I just need good results there. I don’t need to win at Jerez – and maybe I will win there, too. I know that Ducati is very strong there but we improved a lot after the test and I am ready to fight. if I just need a second position in the last race, that’s okay but I am focusing on winning again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 6 / R01: 7 / SP Race: 13 / R02: 5): “It has been of course a difficult weekend after what happened this week. I want to thank the entire team and BMW for supporting me because it was tough but there was no pressure from them. I wanted to ride. Friday was a day to forget but yesterday was not so bad. In Superpole, I had a good feeling and I scored some good points in race one. But it was a difficult long race and I didn’t feel fantastic. The in today’s Superpole race, I didn’t have a good feeling at all. I tried really hard but it just didn’t work. So for race two it was about to calm down a bit and starting from P11 I managed to have a good start and a good race. I had a strong pace, it was a nice and long battle, especially at the end with Andrea Iannone. We are fighting for sixth in the championship so I really wanted to stay in front of him. The bike felt really good and it was nice to finish fifth in race two. Now I think everyone can’t wait to go to Jerez and to have a fantastic weekend there after we have seen what Toprak did this weekend, being pretty close to the ultimate dream of BMW, and I’ll be ready to support him as much as I can.”\n\nGarrett Gerloff, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 17 / R01: 6 / SP Race: 11 / R02: DNF): “It has been a bit of a disappointing day today. I tried to do my best again to get into the top nine in the Superpole race to give me a better start position for the race two. I had a good race with Scott and Michael but in the end none of us finished in the top nine so I had to start from the back again. I had a really good start, I felt really good but then had a technical problem and wasn’t able to finish the race. It was unfortunate because I think it could have been a good day pointswise. But anyway, I only have a couple of days to prepare for the next one and I feel good.”\n\nScott Redding, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 19 / R01: 12 / SP Race: 10 / R02: 11): “Sunday was not so bad, honestly. This morning in warm up, we had miserable track conditions so I just did an outlap and a start. The Superpole race was okay. I felt that I had good speed to get into the top ten. We were fighting a lot, especially over the last few laps. It was really nice so I enjoyed this race. In race two I pushed again to try to finish in the top ten. I didn’t feel as good as in the Superpole race but I felt a lot better than on the other days. I was fighting and in the middle of the race I had some good rhythm but then I destroyed the rear tyre a bit so the last corner was really taking a lot of my lap time away. But I’m reasonably happy because the beginning of the weekend was quite difficult and now we salvaged a better weekend.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

In 2025, BMW M Motorsport will enter its second season in the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and its third in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) with the BMW M Hybrid V8. To achieve its ambitious goals in both race series, BMW M Motorsport joins its forces in terms of driver line-up. Eight BMW M works drivers will share the driving duties for BMW M Team WRT in the FIA WEC and BMW M Team RLL in the IMSA series. New to the team is Formula 1 driver Kevin Magnussen (DEN). He will be joined by Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), René Rast (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) .\n\nIn the BMW M Team WRT line-up for the FIA WEC, there is one change compared to the debut season. In the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Magnussen will start alongside Marciello and Vanthoor. The crew of car #20 remains unchanged with Frijns, Rast, and van der Linde. Wittmann continues as a regular driver in the LMDh programme but switches from the FIA WEC to the IMSA series with BMW M Team RLL. Eng stays in North America and will enter his third season with the BMW M Hybrid V8 there. Van der Linde and Vanthoor will take on a dual role, competing as regular drivers in both the FIA WEC and the full IMSA season. Vanthoor and Eng will share the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, while van der Linde and Wittmann will drive the #25 sister car.\n\nDue to scheduling conflicts between the two racing series, only two drivers per car will participate in the FIA WEC event at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) in May. Vanthoor and van der Linde will simultaneously race in the IMSA event at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nFor the endurance races of the IMSA series at Daytona, Sebring, and Road Atlanta (all USA), the other four LMDh drivers will supplement the line-ups. Magnussen will compete in all three races in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, with Marciello joining as the fourth driver at Daytona. In car #25, Frijns will drive all three races, with Rast completing the Daytona quartet.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We have high goals for the upcoming season with our BMW M Hybrid V8 prototypes. To achieve these, we are striving for optimisations in all areas. For our driver line-up, this means focusing and specialising. The more time our drivers spend behind the wheel of the BMW M Hybrid V8, the better they will get to know its handling and the more feedback they can provide to our engineers. The goal is to intensify the development of the BMW M Hybrid V8 in collaboration with the specialists at the teams and at BMW M Motorsport. It also helps us in this regard, that some drivers compete in both championships, thereby further improving the exchange of information. We are convinced that this way joining our forces will bring us advantages. Of course, the schedule overlap in May is not ideal, but we have the regulatory option to compete in a 6-hour FIA WEC race with two drivers per car, which we will utilise. The fact that the season starts in January with the 24-hour race at Daytona is very beneficial for us. This allows us to have all eight drivers together for an extended period early in the season, helping us to optimally synchronise with each other.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 2025, BMW M Motorsport will enter its second season in the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and its third in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) with the BMW M Hybrid V8.

The Intercultural Innovation Hub showcases innovative projects that directly address these goals, and we are immensely proud of the collaboration between UNAOC and the private sector. Together, we continue to amplify the transformative work of social innovators globally, whose dedication and forward-thinking approaches are driving lasting positive change toward a more united and inclusive world,” said Miguel Ángel Moratinos, UN Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for UNAOC.\n\n“With the Intercultural Innovation Hub, we celebrate outstanding initiatives implemented by extraordinary individuals who are working to bridge intercultural divisions in innovative and impactful ways,” said Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG People and Real Estate, Labour Relations Director. “At the BMW Group, we believe that diversity not only enhances our company, but it is also the very foundation on which our success is built.

Kelvin van der Linde and Weerts, Klingmann and Al Zubair, as well as Bergström and Stadsbader are the WRT drivers participating in both cups, competing for points and titles in the overall GT World Europe standings. In the Sprint Cup, Leung will also have a works driver – again mainly Harper – by his side.\n\nLast season, six GT World Europe titles went to BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers. Team WRT won the overall team standings as well as the team standings in the Sprint Cup. The driver champion in the Silver Cup was Calan Williams (AUS), with the team title also going to WRT. In the Bronze Cup, Paradine Competition triumphed, as did the driver duo Harper/Leung in both the team and driver standings.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “It will be fantastic to see so many BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars on the starting grid of the GT World Challenge Europe. We have very strong pro crews with which we aim to compete for overall victories and titles. Additionally, there are pleasingly many customer teams taking on the challenge in one of the strongest GT racing series in the world and also aiming for titles in all classes. In its first races this season in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, our BMW M4 GT3 EVO immediately achieved victories and demonstrated its enormous potential. Hopefully, many more will follow throughout the season.”\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): “I am proud of the impressive line-up of BMW M Motorsport customer teams and drivers in the GT World Challenge Europe. We won several titles in different classes in 2024. We aim to build on this record and ideally even expand it. I can't wait to walk through the paddock and see the large number of BMW M Motorsport cars.

At 5:32 p.m., it happened. With a par putt for a 73rd round, one of Germany's greatest athletes concluded an almost unbelievable success story at the Golfclub München Eichenried. Bernhard Langer will not be hanging up his golf shoes, but his 513th start (42 wins) on the DP World Tour was also his last. The spectators, who again accompanied him by the thousands today, honoured the two-time Masters winner at the 18th green with Bavarian flags, minutes-long standing ovations, and many of his fellow players and companions paid their respects to the 67-year-old.\n\nAlthough the best German golfer in history will not be teeing off this weekend, it was a day of joy for him. “The start was already great. The first tee-off was already very emotional and incredible. There were people everywhere, in three to ten rows. As Marcel, Martin, and I walked down the first, it was a fantastic scene. We said, 'It's unbelievable what's happening here,’” said Langer. “The 18th was once again world-class. The Bavarian flags and the shouts were very emotional and incredibly great. It was an unbelievable atmosphere. I have never experienced anything like it, and it's a joy that I was able to experience this today, that people took the journey to see me one last time. The scene was more than grand.”\n\nIn total, 15,000 visitors came to the Golfclub München Eichenried on Friday and, besides saying goodbye to a sports legend, also witnessed excellent golf. Foremost from Ewen Ferguson, who carded a 64 to the clubhouse and took the lead with a total score of 13 under par. The Scotsman is two strokes ahead of Romain Langasque (FRA). Third place is shared by Bernd Wiesberger (AUT), 2018 Masters Champion Patrick Reed (USA), the previous day's leader David Micheluzzi (AUS), and the two Englishmen Matthew Southgate and Jordan Smith (all -8).\n\nLanger played yesterday and today with Marcel Siem (-2, T66) and Martin Kaymer (-3, T48). While Kaymer, the only German winner of the BMW International Open (2008), made the cut, Siem was just one stroke short of also being there for the weekend.\n\n“Playing with Martin and Marcel was the icing on the cake,” said Langer. “That the three best German golfers were allowed to play the last two rounds together was a great experience for us, a super feeling. That was probably the last time we played together in a professional tournament. It was really a lot of fun – I hope for the other two as well.”\n\nIn addition to Kaymer, German fans can look forward to Matti Schmid (-5, T24), Jannik de Bruyn (-4, T33), Jeremy Paul, and Freddy Schott (both -3, T48) in the final two rounds.\n\nThe two-time tournament winner Thomas Bjørn (DEN, 2000 & 2002) is so far playing an excellent BMW International Open and is tied for 8th place with 137 strokes (-7), as well as crowd favorite Andrew \"Beef\" Johnston and the 2022 BMW International Open Champion Li Haotong (CHN). However, defending champion Thriston Lawrence (RSA, -1, T80) is out.\n\nFor every eagle during the tournament week, the BMW Group, like last year, donates 1,000 euros to JOBLINGE and Kick ins Leben. The Munich organisations are committed to educational equity and equal opportunities for young people. To the 16 eagles from Thursday, 23 more were added today, so that the donation sum before the weekend is already at 39,000 euros.\n\nDue to a storm warning for Saturday afternoon, the third round will start tomorrow in three-player flights from 7.40 a.m. from Tee 1 and Tee 10.

At 5:32 p.m., it happened. With a par putt for a 73rd round, one of Germany's greatest athletes concluded an almost unbelievable success story at the Golfclub München Eichenried. Bernhard Langer will not be hanging up his golf shoes, but his 513th start (42 wins) on the DP World Tour was also his last. The spectators, who again accompanied him by the thousands today, honoured the two-time Masters winner at the 18th green with Bavarian flags, minutes-long standing ovations, and many of his fellow players and companions paid their respects to the 67-year-old.\n\nAlthough the best German golfer in history will not be teeing off this weekend, it was a day of joy for him. “The start was already great. The first tee-off was already very emotional and incredible. There were people everywhere, in three to ten rows. As Marcel, Martin, and I walked down the first, it was a fantastic scene. We said, 'It's unbelievable what's happening here,’” said Langer. “The 18th was once again world-class. The Bavarian flags and the shouts were very emotional and incredibly great. It was an unbelievable atmosphere. I have never experienced anything like it, and it's a joy that I was able to experience this today, that people took the journey to see me one last time. The scene was more than grand.”\n\nIn total, 15,000 visitors came to the Golfclub München Eichenried on Friday and, besides saying goodbye to a sports legend, also witnessed excellent golf. Foremost from Ewen Ferguson, who carded a 64 to the clubhouse and took the lead with a total score of 13 under par. The Scotsman is two strokes ahead of Romain Langasque (FRA). Third place is shared by Bernd Wiesberger (AUT), 2018 Masters Champion Patrick Reed (USA), the previous day's leader David Micheluzzi (AUS), and the two Englishmen Matthew Southgate and Jordan Smith (all -8).\n\nLanger played yesterday and today with Marcel Siem (-2, T66) and Martin Kaymer (-3, T48). While Kaymer, the only German winner of the BMW International Open (2008), made the cut, Siem was just one stroke short of also being there for the weekend.\n\n“Playing with Martin and Marcel was the icing on the cake,” said Langer. “That the three best German golfers were allowed to play the last two rounds together was a great experience for us, a super feeling. That was probably the last time we played together in a professional tournament. It was really a lot of fun – I hope for the other two as well.”\n\nIn addition to Kaymer, German fans can look forward to Matti Schmid (-5, T24), Jannik de Bruyn (-4, T33), Jeremy Paul, and Freddy Schott (both -3, T48) in the final two rounds.\n\nThe two-time tournament winner Thomas Bjørn (DEN, 2000 & 2002) is so far playing an excellent BMW International Open and is tied for 8th place with 137 strokes (-7), as well as crowd favorite Andrew \"Beef\" Johnston and the 2022 BMW International Open Champion Li Haotong (CHN).

Focused uncompromisingly on riding dynamics, it delivers a far sportier experience than its predecessor thanks to a completely redesigned engine and chassis, while still retaining core BMW values such as touring capability and comfort.\"Christof Lischka, Head of Development BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R: the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is noticeably sportier both technically and visually, featuring dynamic styling for an aggressive, athletic design. Four attractive model variants.\n\nThe goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 R was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the dynamic roadster with boxer engine. Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 R remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 1300 R is offered in Snapper Rocks metallic, with additional variants including the Exclusive variant in Racing blue metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium Option 719 Kilauea in Blackstorm metallic.\n\nSporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun and touring comfort.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 R significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new BMW R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. Optional Comfort handlebars are also available.\n\nA range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height, while a newly developed luggage system with electrified cases and a clever tank bag makes the bike ideal for comfortable touring and holiday trips.\n\nFor many years, BMW’s roadsters with boxer engine have enjoyed an excellent reputation among female customers and restarters in particular. This is thanks to their good accessibility and low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 R again placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of well below 790 mm. In addition to the standard seat, several others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor touring and holiday rides, the new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with a newly developed case system and case holders from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment ex works. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 R has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 R has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences. The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 R can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 R has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 R has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 R also features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels. The reduced rotational masses result in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimised handling qualities.\n\nNew electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA), with dynamic adjustment of the damping, spring rate and load compensation as optional equipment. The world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.\n\nWith its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear, the standard electronic Dynamic ESA itself offers a high level of riding safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. This makes the new BMW R 1300 R the first series production motorcycle with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring rest. With DSA, the rider benefits from even more refined handling and increased banking freedom.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 R comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nStandard full LED headlight in dynamic octagonal design and state-of-the-art LED lighting throughout. Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 R comes as standard with a newly designed LED headlight in a dynamic octagonal shape, featuring a distinctive light icon.\n\nWith the optional Adaptive Turning Light, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimised for cornering, depending on the banking position, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimising the light pattern, the dipped beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW) for safe and comfortable motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R can be equipped with the Riding Assistant for even safer and more comfortable motorcycling. This includes Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW).\n\nFor the first time, navigation preparation now features electric unlocking for maximum operating comfort as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThis item of ex works optional equipment allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a mount cradle. For the first time, this holder no longer requires a key – it unlocks electrically for maximum convenience.\n\nOptional equipment and Original BMW Motorrad Accessories for the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nAn extensive program of optional equipment and optional accessories is available for further customisation of the new BMW R 1300 R.\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW R 1300 R:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The BMW R 1300 R: The new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is significantly sportier, both technically and visually, delivering a more dynamic riding experience."}]}

The “Rain” and “Road” riding modes allow riding characteristics to be adapted to most road conditions. The “Eco” riding mode also makes it possible to use the innovative BMW ShiftCam technology primarily in such a way that the maximum range can be achieved with a single tank of fuel. On request the new R 1300 R can also be fitted with the optional equipment item “Riding Modes Pro” ex works: among other things, this comprises the additional riding modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”. With the riding mode pre-selection the rider can use the riding mode button to make an individual selection. In this way, a preferred and easily manageable number of riding modes can be configured and selected while riding.\n\nEngine drag torque control (MSR) is on board even in standard trim. This can be used to safely avoid unstable riding conditions that can occur during coasting or downshifting due to excessive brake slip at the rear wheel. In these cases, MSR instantly opens the throttle valves to such an extent that drag torque is equalised and the motorcycle stabilises.\n\nAutomated shift assistant (ASA) with fully automated clutch operation and manual or automated shifting for an enhanced motorcycling experience as optional equipment.\n\nWith the automated shift assistant (ASA), BMW Motorrad offers an innovative technical solution to make motorcycling easier and more comfortable. True to the motto “Simplify your Ride”, automated clutch operation and gear changes puts the riding experience even more front and centre – without sacrificing the dynamic of the shifting process.\n\nCompletely newly developed chassis with sheet metal main frame made of steel and aluminium rear frame.\n\nThe chassis of the new BMW R 1300 R has been completely redesigned. The centrepiece is the new sheet metal main frame made of steel, which in addition to a significant optimisation of the installation space for even more compact packaging also offers higher levels of stiffness than the predecessor model. In the course of the redesign, the rear frame was also completely reconceived. In place of the previous tubular steel construction, the new R 1300 R now has a rear frame made of die-cast aluminium.\n\nIn combination with a drive unit that is now much more compact, the new design of the chassis achieved a significant concentration of mass towards the overall centre of gravity, which is reflected in noticeable handling benefits. At the same time, the new R 1300 R is even more precise and stable when braking, requires noticeably less effort to ride, and offers an even more satisfyingly precise response of the suspension elements.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic fork and revised EVO Paralever rear suspension for even greater handling precision. New wheels more than 1.4 kg lighter.\n\nIn the new BMW R 1300 R, front wheel guide is handled by a new upside-down telescopic fork with an inner tube diameter of 47 mm. The rear wheel guide of the new R 1300 R has also been redesigned. The hallmark of the Evo Paralever is a significantly stiffer connection via the suspension in the frame and a continuous swinging arm quick-release axle.\n\nThe new R 1300 R also features new 17-inch aluminium cast wheels with hollow-spoke design. All in all they weigh in at more than 1.4 kg less than the existing wheels. The reduced rotational masses result in both improved acceleration and brake response as well as optimised handling qualities.\n\nNew electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA), with dynamic adjustment of the damping, spring rate and load compensation as optional equipment. The world’s first series production motorcycle telescopic fork with adjustable spring rate.\n\nWith its dynamic adjustment of the damping and adjustable spring rest at the rear, the standard electronic Dynamic ESA itself offers a high level of riding safety and riding fun on a wide variety of terrains.\n\nThe electronic Dynamic Suspension Adjustment (DSA) now goes one step further, combining the dynamic adjustment of the front and rear damping with a corresponding adjustment of the spring rate (“spring stiffness”) – depending on the selected riding mode, riding condition and manoeuvres. This makes the new BMW R 1300 R the first series production motorcycle with an upside-down telescopic fork that allows adjustment of the spring rate. Automatic load compensation is provided by the adjustable spring rest. With DSA, the rider benefits from even more refined handling and increased banking freedom.\n\nA high-performance braking system in conjunction with Integral ABS Pro comes as standard. Sport brake as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe R 1300 R comes as standard with a twin disc brake featuring two radially mounted four-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single disc brake with two-piston floating calliper at the rear in conjunction with BMW Motorrad Integral ABS Pro. The new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with the sport brake system as optional equipment ex works. In addition to a sportier look with titanium-coloured brake callipers, it offers a slight increase in braking performance.\n\nStandard full LED headlight in dynamic octagonal design and state-of-the-art LED lighting throughout. Headlight Pro with adaptive turning light as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW Motorrad is regarded as the pioneer par excellence when it comes to motorcycling safety and related innovations. Accordingly, the new R 1300 R comes as standard with a newly designed LED headlight in a dynamic octagonal shape, featuring a distinctive light icon.\n\nWith the optional Adaptive Turning Light, the dipped beam of the standard full LED headlight is optimised for cornering, depending on the banking position, by activating additional LED elements. In this way, the bend is almost fully illuminated because the light moves to where the motorcycle is heading. By optimising the light pattern, the dipped beam light ensures an even wider and more homogeneous illumination of the road.\n\nRiding Assistant with Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW) for safe and comfortable motorcycling as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R can be equipped with the Riding Assistant for even safer and more comfortable motorcycling. This includes Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Front Collision Warning (FCW).\n\nFor the first time, navigation preparation now features electric unlocking for maximum operating comfort as optional equipment ex works.\n\nThis item of ex works optional equipment allows quick and secure attachment and operation of a navigation device or smartphone using a mount cradle.

Focused uncompromisingly on riding dynamics, it delivers a far sportier experience than its predecessor thanks to a completely redesigned engine and chassis, while still retaining core BMW values such as touring capability and comfort.\"Christof Lischka, Head of Development BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW R 1300 R: the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine is noticeably sportier both technically and visually, featuring dynamic styling for an aggressive, athletic design. Four attractive model variants.\n\nThe goal behind developing the new BMW R 1300 R was to achieve both a visual and technical enhancement of the dynamic roadster with boxer engine. Alongside its more aggressive, sportier design, equipment features such as the Performance variant – including a sport suspension, short hand levers, milled and adjustable footrests, DTC-Shift, two additional sport screens, sport seat, engine spoiler and sport tyres – allow customers to dial up the bike’s dynamic potential even further. At the same time, the BMW R 1300 R remains a capable companion for everyday use and touring, and with options such as seat heating, Riding Assistant, a windscreen, and a variety of luggage choices, the bike can be perfectly tailored to individual needs of this type.\n\nThe basic version of the BMW R 1300 R is offered in Snapper Rocks metallic, with additional variants including the Exclusive variant in Racing blue metallic, the sport-focused Performance variant in Lightwhite uni, and the premium Option 719 Kilauea in Blackstorm metallic.\n\nSporty ergonomics and equipment for both dynamic riding fun and touring comfort.\n\nThe BMW Motorrad developers set out to make the new BMW R 1300 R significantly more dynamic and sporty than its predecessor – a goal the new dynamic roadster with boxer engine fulfils not only in terms of design, engine and chassis: equal importance was also placed on ergonomics, with a focus on creating a sportier, more active riding position.\n\nAccordingly, the ergonomic triangle formed by handlebars, footrests and seat on the new BMW R 1300 R has been designed to position the rider noticeably further forward over the front wheel thanks to slightly rear-set footrests and flatter handlebars. This results in particular in improved feedback from the front end, especially during sporty riding, and therefore even greater controllability. At the same time, the sporty seating position still allows for relaxed touring and cruising, even with a passenger. Optional Comfort handlebars are also available.\n\nA range of seat variants ensures an optimum seat height, while a newly developed luggage system with electrified cases and a clever tank bag makes the bike ideal for comfortable touring and holiday trips.\n\nFor many years, BMW’s roadsters with boxer engine have enjoyed an excellent reputation among female customers and restarters in particular. This is thanks to their good accessibility and low seat height. For this reason, the development of the new R 1300 R again placed particular focus on achieving a seat height of well below 790 mm. In addition to the standard seat, several others are available as individual items of optional equipment ex works.\n\nFor touring and holiday rides, the new BMW R 1300 R can be fitted with a newly developed case system and case holders from the BMW Motorrad Original Accessories range, or with preparation for the luggage system fitted as optional equipment ex works. The cases have a capacity of 26 and 29 litres respectively. Both are electrified and can be unlocked using the central locking system. They also both feature interior lighting, and the left-hand case includes a USB-C charging port. The tank bag is also new. For the first time, it is completely strapless and attaches to the bike via a tank ring.\n\nRugged boxer engine with top figures for power and torque along with optimised running smoothness and efficiency.\n\nThe boxer engine in the new BMW R 1300 R has a capacity of exactly 1 300 cc while the ratio between bore and stroke is 106.5 to 73 mm (predecessor: 102.5 to 76 mm). This increase in capacity derives from an enlarged cylinder bore and a new crankshaft with reduced stroke. It has an output of 107 kW (145 hp) (predecessor: 100 kW (136 hp), still at 7 750 rpm, and develops a maximum torque of 149 Nm at 6 500 rpm (predecessor: 143 Nm at 6 250 rpm), making it by far the most powerful serial production BMW boxer engine to date. Its maximum engine speed is 9 000 rpm.\n\nThree riding modes are included as standard, allowing the bike to adapt ideally to any road conditions. Riding Modes Pro with the additional modes “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro”, along with riding mode pre-selection as optional equipment ex works. Engine drag torque control (MSR) as standard.\n\nIn standard trim, the new R 1300 R has three riding modes for adaptation to individual rider preferences.

Mission title defense accomplished: Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) is once again the World Champion in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) for 2025! With third place in the second main race of the dramatic season finale in Jerez de la Frontera (ESP), ‘El Turco’ secured the crown. This marks his second consecutive World Championship title as a BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory rider with the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team – and the third WorldSBK title of his career (2021, 2024, 2025).\n\nAfter his outstanding championship win in 2024, Razgatlioglu entered the 2025 season as the clear favourite. However, following a winter testing phase during which the BMW M 1000 RR had to be adapted at short notice due to regulation changes, the season started off more challenging than expected. Despite scoring a hat-trick at the second round in Portimão (POR), there were also setbacks, and Razgatlioglu found himself in the role of the chaser behind Ducati rider Nicolò Bulega (ITA).\n\nBut by mid-season in June, ‘El Turco’, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team turned the tide. In Misano (ITA), Donington Park (GBR), the new Balaton Park Circuit (HUN), and Magny-Cours (FRA), he won every race – achieving four consecutive hat-tricks and taking the championship lead. He then celebrated his first-ever victory at MotorLand Aragón (ESP), equaling his own record from 2024 of 13 consecutive wins. After further victories and podium finishes, he ultimately secured the 2025 title with 616 points – 13 points ahead of Bulega.\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) wrapped up his final weekend as a WorldSBK rider with more strong Top 10 finishes. After five years with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (2021–2025), he will remain part of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family. Already on Tuesday in Jerez de la Frontera, he will be back on the BMW M 1000 RR, working with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team to prepare for the 2026 WorldSBK season.\n\nReactions after the season finale.\n\nMarkus Flasch, CEO of BMW Motorrad: “Congratulations to Toprak and the entire team! This season, everyone has shown what true champions are made of. The first races weren’t easy, but for everyone – especially for Toprak – the attitude was clear: stand up, straighten your crown, and keep going. And what a way they kept going! The winning streak that began in Misano was simply breathtaking. Even on the nerve-racking final Sunday here in Jerez, after the unfortunate retirement in the Superpole Race through no fault of his own, everyone stayed completely focused and prepared everything perfectly so that Toprak could seal the deal in race two. The reward is Toprak’s well-deserved second World Championship title on our BMW M 1000 RR. We are incredibly proud of him and of everyone in the team, in Munich and Berlin, whose hard work made this achievement possible.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am very happy and smiling. To get the title was very important for me. This was my last year with BMW and in the Superbike Paddock. It is a great gift to BMW before I leave for MotoGP. In the end we are World Champions. At the beginning of the season, we were not so strong but we improved with every race. Thanks to the entire team and BMW for all this hard work. It is not me being the World Champion, it is us. Looking back onto this final weekend: Everything went very well yesterday especially and today I came to the track more relaxed. I just needed to finish the Superpole Race within the top seven but we crashed in turn five. I know this is racing and everybody wants to pass. It is that he (Nicolò Bulega) just hit me and I crashed. After that I just stayed calm and focused on race two because I needed to do a good job there. I just focused on achieving the best possible position. I started the race not pushing too hard but I worked my way to the front step by step and in the end, we were on the podium. To be World Champion again is a great feeling and I want to thank everyone who was part of this journey.”\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I am very happy – and speechless. It is such a great day. I think that after the Superpole Race, we all aged by ten years. The job the team did was amazing. The bike was pretty damaged and to work under that pressure to get it ready for race two was incredible. Everybody stayed calm, and I think this was in the end the key for us to win the title. The second title in a row – we are happy for Toprak, for the team, for BMW Motorrad. Toprak wrote history for BMW. It was wild ride together and we are sad that it’s over but we will cheer for him next year. And we are also so thankful for everything that Mickey has done for us. We had difficult years, also with injuries but he was always loyal to us. And he has played an important part in winning these two title in both years. We are really looking forward to continue working with him. What we are going to do, we will announce soon. But for now – we are going to have a big party tonight, and from tomorrow on we fully focus on the 2026 WorldSBK season with Danilo Petrucci and Miguel Oliveira.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I can‘t describe how I feel because it was an incredible day. A few hours with a lot of emotions, ups and downs, everything happened. But at the end for sure to see Toprak back on the podium, celebrating the second world championship for us, for BMW, makes me very proud and the whole project, the whole team, everybody involved. So it’s a fantastic day to complete a fantastic. At the end the key for any success in sport is always focus and teamwork. We listened to the riders, we looked into our package and tried to be focused to learn from the situation when we were not fast enough to beat our competitors. And with the focus of the riders, of the crew and all our technicians in Munich, we managed to turn the page. Thank you to Toprak, who is an incredible person on and off the track, thank you to Mickey, who did so much for us since he joined in 2021, and thank you to the entire team! A very personal thank-you also goes to my wife Katharina and my kids, who are always a source of support for me.”\n\nShaun Muir, Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “My feelings are really tough to put into words. We woke up feeling super, super positive, but as we always know anything can happen in racing and it actually did in the sprint race. I’ve just got to put my hands together and praise the good work the guys did. The entire team stayed focused. In the end Toprak is a three-times World Champion, and two times with BMW. I am absolutely over the moon, proud as you can be, of everyone involved and the lot of hard work everybody did.\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a nice weekend. I have for sure some mixed feelings about my races, especially race two I didn’t enjoy as much as I wish I did. But you know it’s racing and I think after today we have a lot of things to be happy about with the team. It has been a strange season. The start of the season was a bit weird with the last minute changes in regulations and stuff like that. Especially my side, I struggled quite a lot with the bike honestly. Also at one point, mentally it was difficult and I just could not find any progress. That has been tough. But we always kept working, the team always kept working and I think towards the end of the year I did the Suzuka 8 Hours, got my confidence back and then when I came back I had the speed again and I felt more confident with the bike. I think Toprak showed again how special he is and he so deserves the title. He and the entire team deserve the title. Time went fast, and I enjoyed my time in WorldSBK. I have six wins here and podiums. Now I have exactly one day off and on Tuesday I will start with the test team to improve the package for next year for Danilo and Miguel.”\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 21°, humidity: 59%, conditions: dry.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 29°, track temperature: 30°, humidity: 41%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 2, 1:38.737\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 21°, humidity: 60%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nBimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 2, 1:37.659 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 27°, track temperature: 30°, humidity: 49%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 3, 1:38.693\n\nFinal riders’ classification (R12/12, after 36 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFinal manufacturers’ classification (R12/12, after 36 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Toprak Razgatlioglu clinches his second consecutive World Championship title with BMW Motorrad Motorsport in the FIM Superbike World Championship. +++ Title decided in a thrilling season finale Sunday in Jerez de la Frontera. +++ Markus Flasch: “Congratulations to Toprak and the entire team!

At the beginning of the season, we were not so strong but we improved with every race. Thanks to the entire team and BMW for all this hard work. It is not me being the World Champion, it is us. Looking back onto this final weekend: Everything went very well yesterday especially and today I came to the track more relaxed. I just needed to finish the Superpole Race within the top seven but we crashed in turn five. I know this is racing and everybody wants to pass. It is that he (Nicolò Bulega) just hit me and I crashed. After that I just stayed calm and focused on race two because I needed to do a good job there. I just focused on achieving the best possible position. I started the race not pushing too hard but I worked my way to the front step by step and in the end, we were on the podium. To be World Champion again is a great feeling and I want to thank everyone who was part of this journey.”\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I am very happy – and speechless. It is such a great day. I think that after the Superpole Race, we all aged by ten years. The job the team did was amazing. The bike was pretty damaged and to work under that pressure to get it ready for race two was incredible. Everybody stayed calm, and I think this was in the end the key for us to win the title. The second title in a row – we are happy for Toprak, for the team, for BMW Motorrad. Toprak wrote history for BMW. It was wild ride together and we are sad that it’s over but we will cheer for him next year. And we are also so thankful for everything that Mickey has done for us. We had difficult years, also with injuries but he was always loyal to us. And he has played an important part in winning these two title in both years. We are really looking forward to continue working with him. What we are going to do, we will announce soon. But for now – we are going to have a big party tonight, and from tomorrow on we fully focus on the 2026 WorldSBK season with Danilo Petrucci and Miguel Oliveira.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I can‘t describe how I feel because it was an incredible day. A few hours with a lot of emotions, ups and downs, everything happened. But at the end for sure to see Toprak back on the podium, celebrating the second world championship for us, for BMW, makes me very proud and the whole project, the whole team, everybody involved. So it’s a fantastic day to complete a fantastic. At the end the key for any success in sport is always focus and teamwork. We listened to the riders, we looked into our package and tried to be focused to learn from the situation when we were not fast enough to beat our competitors. And with the focus of the riders, of the crew and all our technicians in Munich, we managed to turn the page. Thank you to Toprak, who is an incredible person on and off the track, thank you to Mickey, who did so much for us since he joined in 2021, and thank you to the entire team! A very personal thank-you also goes to my wife Katharina and my kids, who are always a source of support for me.”\n\nShaun Muir, Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “My feelings are really tough to put into words. We woke up feeling super, super positive, but as we always know anything can happen in racing and it actually did in the sprint race. I’ve just got to put my hands together and praise the good work the guys did. The entire team stayed focused. In the end Toprak is a three-times World Champion, and two times with BMW. I am absolutely over the moon, proud as you can be, of everyone involved and the lot of hard work everybody did.\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a nice weekend. I have for sure some mixed feelings about my races, especially race two I didn’t enjoy as much as I wish I did. But you know it’s racing and I think after today we have a lot of things to be happy about with the team. It has been a strange season. The start of the season was a bit weird with the last minute changes in regulations and stuff like that. Especially my side, I struggled quite a lot with the bike honestly. Also at one point, mentally it was difficult and I just could not find any progress. That has been tough. But we always kept working, the team always kept working and I think towards the end of the year I did the Suzuka 8 Hours, got my confidence back and then when I came back I had the speed again and I felt more confident with the bike. I think Toprak showed again how special he is and he so deserves the title. He and the entire team deserve the title. Time went fast, and I enjoyed my time in WorldSBK. I have six wins here and podiums. Now I have exactly one day off and on Tuesday I will start with the test team to improve the package for next year for Danilo and Miguel.”\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 21°, humidity: 59%, conditions: dry.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 29°, track temperature: 30°, humidity: 41%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 2, 1:38.737\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 21°, humidity: 60%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nBimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 2, 1:37.659 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 27°, track temperature: 30°, humidity: 49%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 3, 1:38.693\n\nFinal riders’ classification (R12/12, after 36 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFinal manufacturers’ classification (R12/12, after 36 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "He did it again: Toprak Razgatlioglu is the 2025 WorldSBK World Champion!"}]}

This season, everyone has shown what true champions are made of.” +++Jerez de la Frontera. Mission title defense accomplished: Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) is once again the World Champion in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) for 2025! With third place in the second main race of the dramatic season finale in Jerez de la Frontera (ESP), ‘El Turco’ secured the crown. This marks his second consecutive World Championship title as a BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory rider with the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team – and the third WorldSBK title of his career (2021, 2024, 2025).\n\nAfter his outstanding championship win in 2024, Razgatlioglu entered the 2025 season as the clear favourite. However, following a winter testing phase during which the BMW M 1000 RR had to be adapted at short notice due to regulation changes, the season started off more challenging than expected. Despite scoring a hat-trick at the second round in Portimão (POR), there were also setbacks, and Razgatlioglu found himself in the role of the chaser behind Ducati rider Nicolò Bulega (ITA).\n\nBut by mid-season in June, ‘El Turco’, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team turned the tide. In Misano (ITA), Donington Park (GBR), the new Balaton Park Circuit (HUN), and Magny-Cours (FRA), he won every race – achieving four consecutive hat-tricks and taking the championship lead. He then celebrated his first-ever victory at MotorLand Aragón (ESP), equaling his own record from 2024 of 13 consecutive wins. After further victories and podium finishes, he ultimately secured the 2025 title with 616 points – 13 points ahead of Bulega.\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) wrapped up his final weekend as a WorldSBK rider with more strong Top 10 finishes. After five years with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (2021–2025), he will remain part of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family. Already on Tuesday in Jerez de la Frontera, he will be back on the BMW M 1000 RR, working with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team to prepare for the 2026 WorldSBK season.\n\nReactions after the season finale.\n\nMarkus Flasch, CEO of BMW Motorrad: “Congratulations to Toprak and the entire team! This season, everyone has shown what true champions are made of. The first races weren’t easy, but for everyone – especially for Toprak – the attitude was clear: stand up, straighten your crown, and keep going. And what a way they kept going! The winning streak that began in Misano was simply breathtaking. Even on the nerve-racking final Sunday here in Jerez, after the unfortunate retirement in the Superpole Race through no fault of his own, everyone stayed completely focused and prepared everything perfectly so that Toprak could seal the deal in race two. The reward is Toprak’s well-deserved second World Championship title on our BMW M 1000 RR. We are incredibly proud of him and of everyone in the team, in Munich and Berlin, whose hard work made this achievement possible.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am very happy and smiling.

The fifth event of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team to Most in the Czech Republic. There, reigning world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) on the BMW M 1000 RR proved to be – at least almost – unbeatable. ‘El Turco’ was the fastest in all practice sessions, secured pole position, won race one and the Superpole race, clocked the fastest lap in all three races, and set new lap records. In the second main race, it looked like he would complete the hat-trick until just a few metres from the finish. Only shortly before the finish line was long-time rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) able to overtake, and Razgatlioglu had to settle for second place by a mere 0.027 seconds. Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) had double bad luck at Most. In Superpole, he was among the many riders whose fastest lap was cancelled due to a yellow flag, leaving him 15th on the grid. At the start of race one, he was involved in a multi-rider crash through no fault of his own and had to retire. On Sunday, van der Mark finished 13th and 14th.\n\nReactions after the Most round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “What a weekend! We’re extremely proud of the entire team – those at the track, at home, and in the test team. Everyone has worked very hard since Cremona, and that has put us in a position to take pole position and two wins. We only missed out on race two by a few hundredths of a second. Of course, that hurt, but overall, the performance Toprak showed this weekend was incredible. What he delivered on the bike was simply outstanding. All in all, we now head into the next races at Misano with a positive outlook. We’ve managed to reduce the points gap in both the riders’ and manufacturers’ standings. Mickey was strong in the practice sessions, but unfortunately unlucky in Superpole, which meant he had to start from the back and couldn’t fight his way forward properly. Now we go to Misano knowing that we can fight again and that we’re right in the mix. We’re looking forward to Italy and will give everything to close the gap even further.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was once again an intense weekend here at Most, which is practically a home race for us. It’s just a few hours’ drive from Munich, and there were many fans from Germany here. Friday’s practice sessions were run under very tricky mixed conditions. Still, Toprak managed them very solidly and showed very strong race pace during a simulation in FP2. That the BMW M 1000 RR has this kind of pace was confirmed on Saturday and Sunday. In Superpole, Toprak translated the bike’s performance into a perfect lap time. What followed were three extremely strong races from him. Mickey showed good performance in free practice. His weekend was heavily affected by the complicated qualifying, with his final fast lap being deleted due to yellow flags. That meant he had no chance to start further up the grid. His starting position made all his races difficult, and he couldn’t show his or the bike’s full potential. We’ll see him come back stronger at Misano. Overall, it was a successful weekend for us with two wins and a second place – only 0.027 seconds behind. We’ve shown that we can continue to fight with Ducati and Nicolò Bulega for the World Championship, even though they still seem to have an advantage on the straights after the latest fuel flow regulation changes. So we leave Most with one eye smiling – and one eye crying, because the hat-trick just didn’t happen.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The weekend started amazingly for me. We took pole and won the first two races. But in the second main race, I had some bad luck. It was not a technical problem but in the last few sectors on the final lap the bike felt strange. On the straight, I felt some cut and we lost P1. Anyway, it was a hard effort by everyone and we did a really good weekend. I’m just a bit unhappy that we did not do three wins but only two. Overall, it was not bad, we collected important points for the championship and everything else, we will see at the next race.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I started the weekend quite well. In FP1 and FP2, we had a strong pace and good lap times. My feeling with the bike was good, also in FP3 I felt confident. In Superpole, they unfortunately took my lap away because of the yellow flag. So I was starting from P15 which isn’t ideal on this track where it is hard to pass and the differences are so small. In the first race, I was just unlucky in turn 1, being taken out by someone elses crash. It was a big shame but it happens. In the Superpole race, I tried to get into the top nine so I had to pass but unfortunately could not make it. So I started from 15th again. I had a good start and strong first couple of corners but then I struggled a lot with the bike. It was so hard to ride and I couldn’t maintain a good pace. At the end, I lost a few positions again. It was very strange. We had a good start to the weekend but then difficult races. Now I’m looking forward to Misano to make some progress there.”\n\nAir temperature: 14°, track temperature: 24°, humidity: 48%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAir temperature: 16°, track temperature: 27°, humidity: 43%, conditions: dry, laps: 22.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 10, 1:31.109 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 12°, track temperature: 22°, humidity: 56%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:30.201 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 14°, track temperature: 22°, humidity: 51%, conditions: dry, laps: 22.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nGYTR GRT Yamaha WorldSBK Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:30.379\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R05/12, after 15 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R05/12, after 15 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fifth event of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team to Most in the Czech Republic.

There, reigning world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) on the BMW M 1000 RR proved to be – at least almost – unbeatable. ‘El Turco’ was the fastest in all practice sessions, secured pole position, won race one and the Superpole race, clocked the fastest lap in all three races, and set new lap records. In the second main race, it looked like he would complete the hat-trick until just a few metres from the finish. Only shortly before the finish line was long-time rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati) able to overtake, and Razgatlioglu had to settle for second place by a mere 0.027 seconds. Teammate Michael van der Mark (NED) had double bad luck at Most. In Superpole, he was among the many riders whose fastest lap was cancelled due to a yellow flag, leaving him 15th on the grid. At the start of race one, he was involved in a multi-rider crash through no fault of his own and had to retire. On Sunday, van der Mark finished 13th and 14th.\n\nReactions after the Most round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrrad Motorsport: “What a weekend! We’re extremely proud of the entire team – those at the track, at home, and in the test team. Everyone has worked very hard since Cremona, and that has put us in a position to take pole position and two wins. We only missed out on race two by a few hundredths of a second. Of course, that hurt, but overall, the performance Toprak showed this weekend was incredible. What he delivered on the bike was simply outstanding. All in all, we now head into the next races at Misano with a positive outlook. We’ve managed to reduce the points gap in both the riders’ and manufacturers’ standings. Mickey was strong in the practice sessions, but unfortunately unlucky in Superpole, which meant he had to start from the back and couldn’t fight his way forward properly. Now we go to Misano knowing that we can fight again and that we’re right in the mix. We’re looking forward to Italy and will give everything to close the gap even further.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was once again an intense weekend here at Most, which is practically a home race for us. It’s just a few hours’ drive from Munich, and there were many fans from Germany here. Friday’s practice sessions were run under very tricky mixed conditions. Still, Toprak managed them very solidly and showed very strong race pace during a simulation in FP2. That the BMW M 1000 RR has this kind of pace was confirmed on Saturday and Sunday. In Superpole, Toprak translated the bike’s performance into a perfect lap time. What followed were three extremely strong races from him. Mickey showed good performance in free practice. His weekend was heavily affected by the complicated qualifying, with his final fast lap being deleted due to yellow flags. That meant he had no chance to start further up the grid. His starting position made all his races difficult, and he couldn’t show his or the bike’s full potential. We’ll see him come back stronger at Misano. Overall, it was a successful weekend for us with two wins and a second place – only 0.027 seconds behind. We’ve shown that we can continue to fight with Ducati and Nicolò Bulega for the World Championship, even though they still seem to have an advantage on the straights after the latest fuel flow regulation changes. So we leave Most with one eye smiling – and one eye crying, because the hat-trick just didn’t happen.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The weekend started amazingly for me. We took pole and won the first two races. But in the second main race, I had some bad luck. It was not a technical problem but in the last few sectors on the final lap the bike felt strange. On the straight, I felt some cut and we lost P1. Anyway, it was a hard effort by everyone and we did a really good weekend. I’m just a bit unhappy that we did not do three wins but only two. Overall, it was not bad, we collected important points for the championship and everything else, we will see at the next race.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I started the weekend quite well. In FP1 and FP2, we had a strong pace and good lap times. My feeling with the bike was good, also in FP3 I felt confident. In Superpole, they unfortunately took my lap away because of the yellow flag. So I was starting from P15 which isn’t ideal on this track where it is hard to pass and the differences are so small. In the first race, I was just unlucky in turn 1, being taken out by someone elses crash. It was a big shame but it happens. In the Superpole race, I tried to get into the top nine so I had to pass but unfortunately could not make it. So I started from 15th again. I had a good start and strong first couple of corners but then I struggled a lot with the bike. It was so hard to ride and I couldn’t maintain a good pace. At the end, I lost a few positions again. It was very strange. We had a good start to the weekend but then difficult races. Now I’m looking forward to Misano to make some progress there.”\n\nAir temperature: 14°, track temperature: 24°, humidity: 48%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAir temperature: 16°, track temperature: 27°, humidity: 43%, conditions: dry, laps: 22.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 10, 1:31.109 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 12°, track temperature: 22°, humidity: 56%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:30.201 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 14°, track temperature: 22°, humidity: 51%, conditions: dry, laps: 22.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nGYTR GRT Yamaha WorldSBK Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:30.379\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R05/12, after 15 of 36 races).\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R05/12, after 15 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "WorldSBK at Most: Toprak Razgatlioglu (almost) unbeatable."}]}

With the publication of its Environmental Impact Statement 2024, all BMW Group operations in Parsdorf are now part of the European environmental register, EMAS. In addition to the BMW Group Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) and test-parts logistics, the pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf has been included in the environmental impact statement and EMAS registration for the first time. EMAS stands for the “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme”, which claims to be the most stringent environmental management system in the world. “We are very pleased with the EMAS registration of all our operations in Parsdorf, which underlines that our processes operate at a very high level – both economically and environmentally,” says Hansjörg Schilp, director of the CMCC and pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf. “The entire team has done an outstanding job.”\n\nEMAS: Strict requirements and high environmental standards\n\nTo be listed in the EMAS Register, companies must fulfil strict requirements and adhere to rigorous environmental standards. EMAS is a globally recognised framework that enables organisations to manage and continuously improve their environmental impact. A key element of the EMAS environmental management system is the international environmental management standard ISO 14001. EMAS also focuses on measurable improvements, transparency and legal certainty. Auditing aims to support companies in continuously improving their environmental performance – for example, by using energy and material more efficiently and reducing emissions, wastewater and waste from their sites. Beyond these direct environmental impacts, EMAS also addresses and evaluates indirect aspects, including the sustainability of products, procurement and supply chains, contractor practices and the environmental impact of employees commuting to work. (Source: \n\nEfficient operations and concepts for the circular economy\n\nThe validated environmental impact statement and the resulting inclusion in the EMAS Register by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) for Munich and Upper Bavaria underscore the rigorous environmental standards upheld by the BMW Group in Parsdorf. Battery cell production at the CMCC, one of the three Parsdorf facilities, is powered entirely by electricity from 100% renewable energy sources. Hot water for process ventilation is generated using waste heat recovered from various primary processes, and all three Parsdorf facilities utilise heat pumps in their operations. “On our pilot lines for battery cells and high-voltage batteries, we are focusing on reducing the use of critical raw materials and energy, avoiding solvents and developing innovative circular economy approaches,” explains Schilp. Raw materials represent a significant cost factor for battery cells and high-voltage batteries. Efficient and responsible use of these resources is therefore necessary and also makes economic sense. The BMW Group is gaining valuable insights in this area in Parsdorf. Residual materials from the production process are collected and, wherever technically feasible, reintegrated into the value-creation cycle at the BMW Group’s Competence Centres through direct recycling. This innovative procedure enables residual materials from battery cell production, as well as whole battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled into their components.\n\nTransparent reporting: Environmental impact statement now online\n\nThe environmental impact statement for the BMW Group’s Parsdorf operations (CMCC, pilot plant for high-voltage batteries and test-parts logistics) has been independently reviewed by TÜV SÜD Umweltgutachter GmbH and is now available online at: \n\nHow the cell is created: Production steps for sample manufacturing at the CMCC\n\nCell manufacturing at the CMCC in Parsdorf begins with electrode production: Here, the base material, comprising, for example, graphite for the anode and nickel oxides for the cathode, with binders and solvents, is metered and mixed in a precisely measured ratio. This creates the so-called “slurry” – which means wafer-thin metal foils are coated and then compressed after drying. In technical jargon, this is referred to as “calendering”. The highest level of precision is required: The foil is just a few micrometres thick – in other words, thinner than the threads of a spider web – while the coating is in the micrometre range. During cell assembly, the coated foils, referred to in the jargon as calendered electrodes, are coiled into so-called “jelly rolls” using the separator and inserted into the cell housing. The cells are filled with electrolyte, then charged for the first time and finally checked for functionality and quality.\n\nParsdorf pioneers: How the BMW Group builds Gen6 high-voltage batteries\n\nParsdorf is also home to the BMW Group’s largest pilot plant for Gen6 high-voltage batteries, where production processes are developed and tested before large-scale production begins at the series plants in Debrecen (Hungary), Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). More than 350 employees have been building initial high-voltage battery prototypes here since 2023. In the meantime, these batteries have also been delivered to the vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where they were installed in test vehicles for the Neue Klasse. For series production, the BMW Group sources battery cells for its high-voltage batteries from leading cell manufacturers, who produce the cells to the company's specifications. The highest technical standards apply. Upon receipt of goods, additional measurements – such as voltage checks – are carried out. Next comes cell clustering, where the battery cells are connected to coolers. This step ensures optimal insulation and cooling of the cells. The cell clusters and cell contact system are then laser-cleaned and welded with pinpoint precision. The in-line inspection continuously monitors each weld seam in real time. An innovative foaming process follows, ensuring that all elements are protected as a mechanical unit. The foam thus guarantees the safety, stability and durability of the high-voltage battery. The housing is then closed, sealed and riveted. In the final assembly step, the Energy Master – the central control unit – is installed onto the high-voltage battery. A permanently elastic sealing adhesive is applied to ensure a reliable seal. Finally, each high-voltage battery undergoes a 100% end-of-line inspection to ensure quality, safety and function."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Parsdorf high-voltage battery pilot plant included for first time +++ BMW Group meets strict requirements +++ Environmental impact statement now online +++"}]}

This innovative procedure enables residual materials from battery cell production, as well as whole battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled into their components.\n\nTransparent reporting: Environmental impact statement now online\n\nThe environmental impact statement for the BMW Group’s Parsdorf operations (CMCC, pilot plant for high-voltage batteries and test-parts logistics) has been independently reviewed by TÜV SÜD Umweltgutachter GmbH and is now available online at: \n\nHow the cell is created: Production steps for sample manufacturing at the CMCC\n\nCell manufacturing at the CMCC in Parsdorf begins with electrode production: Here, the base material, comprising, for example, graphite for the anode and nickel oxides for the cathode, with binders and solvents, is metered and mixed in a precisely measured ratio. This creates the so-called “slurry” – which means wafer-thin metal foils are coated and then compressed after drying. In technical jargon, this is referred to as “calendering”. The highest level of precision is required: The foil is just a few micrometres thick – in other words, thinner than the threads of a spider web – while the coating is in the micrometre range. During cell assembly, the coated foils, referred to in the jargon as calendered electrodes, are coiled into so-called “jelly rolls” using the separator and inserted into the cell housing. The cells are filled with electrolyte, then charged for the first time and finally checked for functionality and quality.\n\nParsdorf pioneers: How the BMW Group builds Gen6 high-voltage batteries\n\nParsdorf is also home to the BMW Group’s largest pilot plant for Gen6 high-voltage batteries, where production processes are developed and tested before large-scale production begins at the series plants in Debrecen (Hungary), Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). More than 350 employees have been building initial high-voltage battery prototypes here since 2023. In the meantime, these batteries have also been delivered to the vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where they were installed in test vehicles for the Neue Klasse. For series production, the BMW Group sources battery cells for its high-voltage batteries from leading cell manufacturers, who produce the cells to the company's specifications. The highest technical standards apply. Upon receipt of goods, additional measurements – such as voltage checks – are carried out. Next comes cell clustering, where the battery cells are connected to coolers. This step ensures optimal insulation and cooling of the cells. The cell clusters and cell contact system are then laser-cleaned and welded with pinpoint precision. The in-line inspection continuously monitors each weld seam in real time. An innovative foaming process follows, ensuring that all elements are protected as a mechanical unit. The foam thus guarantees the safety, stability and durability of the high-voltage battery. The housing is then closed, sealed and riveted. In the final assembly step, the Energy Master – the central control unit – is installed onto the high-voltage battery. A permanently elastic sealing adhesive is applied to ensure a reliable seal. Finally, each high-voltage battery undergoes a 100% end-of-line inspection to ensure quality, safety and function."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The BMW Group is using its presence at the \"Fleet Europe Days\" on 22 and 23 October in Luxembourg to show fleet operators ways to decarbonise their fleets. In addition to fully electrified vehicles, the focus will be on fuels based on renewable raw materials, so-called Carbon Neutral Fuels (CNF).\n\nTheir advantage: the potential to save CO2. With more than 250 million existing vehicles in Europe, their CO2 footprint can be improved if the proportion of renewable fuels is increased. A new technical solution used by the BMW Group is proof that all BMW diesels in a fleet are fuelled exclusively with HVO100. Refuelling data from the vehicle is compared with data from the fleet operator's payment system. This means that the fuel used by the vehicle can be traced seamlessly. An important step towards a \"CNF only-fleet\" for fleet customers. Dr. Martin Kaufmann, Head of Powertrain Development at the BMW Group: \"Our goal is always to have more environmentally friendly and efficient vehicles on the road.

On 26th/27th April, the DTM kicks off its new season at Oschersleben (GER). In preparation for the first two races, the official DTM test day took place at the same location this week. Schubert Motorsport gathered valuable experience with its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs and BMW M factory drivers René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER). At the end of the two sessions on Wednesday, more than 250 test laps were recorded.\n\nThe focus of the tests for the team and both drivers was to familiarise themselves as much as possible with the EVO version of the BMW M4 GT3 in combination with the new Pirelli tyres that are used in the DTM. Rast completed 129 laps in the #33 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, which featured a new design from BMW M Motorsport partner RoboMarkets, and recorded a personal best time of 1:23.394 minutes. Wittmann completed 132 laps in his “Green Machine”, the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in Schaeffler colours, achieving a best time of 1:23.091 minutes. Schubert Motorsport enters the DTM season as the defending champion in the team standings and traditionally plays its home game at the Motorsport Arena Oschersleben.\n\nBMW M Motorsport and Endless are expanding their partnership.\n\nThe development of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO included a focus on optimising the brakes, with valuable assistance from brake specialist Endless, who has been collaborating with BMW M Motorsport since 2020. The partnership, previously limited to individual racing series such as the DTM and the Intercontinental GT Challenge, is now extended to the entire GT3 main programme. Endless will, among other things, appear for the first time as a partner of BMW M Motorsport in the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The test day was crucial for Schubert Motorsport and the drivers to gain experience with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The focus was on completing as many laps as possible and working through the extensive test programme. The Pirelli tyres are new to everyone, and it's particularly important to test how they perform on a long run. We will only find out where we stand in terms of lap times compared to the competition during the race weekend. Generally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, we aim to achieve victories and titles in the biggest GT racing series and at the most important single events worldwide. Endless, as a brake specialist with outstanding expertise, assists us in this endeavour. Together, we have worked on optimising our GT3 car, and we have already celebrated our first successes. I am very pleased that we were able to further expand our partnership with a view to the coming years and join forces worldwide.”\n\nLucas Nylund (CEO Endless Brake Technology Europe): “Since we started to collaborate with BMW M Motorsport in 2020, we have always felt very welcome within the BMW M Motorsport family as the supplier of high-quality racing brake technology, and we are happy to match the high expectations of BMW M Motorsport on all parts of their GT3 cars. To extend our partnership with BMW M Motorsport is a fantastic opportunity which we are very proud of, and we are looking forward to continuing our shared success story and to work even closer together with BMW M Motorsport by supporting their global GT3 programme. We would like to thank Andreas Roos, the drivers, the engineers, and the entire staff at BMW M Motorsport for their trust in Endless and for the further expanded partnership for the coming years. We will do our very best to achieve even more victories and to further continue our long-lasting success story.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “The anticipation for the DTM season is high, and the official test drives are always a great start to the intensive phase. We completed a full test programme, and I was able to spend a lot of time in the car. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt good. Compared to its predecessor, it offers a larger operating window, which will hopefully help us to better adapt the car to the specific challenges that the DTM presents than last year. We are currently experimenting in this area so that we can benefit from it from the first race weekend onwards.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I drove the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time and used the test day to get accustomed to the car. Even though there are few external changes, there are quite a few new features under the hood. Lap times have not yet played a role for us. That will be the focus in a few weeks when we compete in our first races at Oschersleben.

In preparation for the first two races, the official DTM test day took place at the same location this week. Schubert Motorsport gathered valuable experience with its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs and BMW M factory drivers René Rast and Marco Wittmann (both GER). At the end of the two sessions on Wednesday, more than 250 test laps were recorded.\n\nThe focus of the tests for the team and both drivers was to familiarise themselves as much as possible with the EVO version of the BMW M4 GT3 in combination with the new Pirelli tyres that are used in the DTM. Rast completed 129 laps in the #33 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, which featured a new design from BMW M Motorsport partner RoboMarkets, and recorded a personal best time of 1:23.394 minutes. Wittmann completed 132 laps in his “Green Machine”, the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in Schaeffler colours, achieving a best time of 1:23.091 minutes. Schubert Motorsport enters the DTM season as the defending champion in the team standings and traditionally plays its home game at the Motorsport Arena Oschersleben.\n\nBMW M Motorsport and Endless are expanding their partnership.\n\nThe development of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO included a focus on optimising the brakes, with valuable assistance from brake specialist Endless, who has been collaborating with BMW M Motorsport since 2020. The partnership, previously limited to individual racing series such as the DTM and the Intercontinental GT Challenge, is now extended to the entire GT3 main programme. Endless will, among other things, appear for the first time as a partner of BMW M Motorsport in the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The test day was crucial for Schubert Motorsport and the drivers to gain experience with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The focus was on completing as many laps as possible and working through the extensive test programme. The Pirelli tyres are new to everyone, and it's particularly important to test how they perform on a long run. We will only find out where we stand in terms of lap times compared to the competition during the race weekend. Generally, with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, we aim to achieve victories and titles in the biggest GT racing series and at the most important single events worldwide. Endless, as a brake specialist with outstanding expertise, assists us in this endeavour. Together, we have worked on optimising our GT3 car, and we have already celebrated our first successes. I am very pleased that we were able to further expand our partnership with a view to the coming years and join forces worldwide.”\n\nLucas Nylund (CEO Endless Brake Technology Europe): “Since we started to collaborate with BMW M Motorsport in 2020, we have always felt very welcome within the BMW M Motorsport family as the supplier of high-quality racing brake technology, and we are happy to match the high expectations of BMW M Motorsport on all parts of their GT3 cars. To extend our partnership with BMW M Motorsport is a fantastic opportunity which we are very proud of, and we are looking forward to continuing our shared success story and to work even closer together with BMW M Motorsport by supporting their global GT3 programme. We would like to thank Andreas Roos, the drivers, the engineers, and the entire staff at BMW M Motorsport for their trust in Endless and for the further expanded partnership for the coming years. We will do our very best to achieve even more victories and to further continue our long-lasting success story.”\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “The anticipation for the DTM season is high, and the official test drives are always a great start to the intensive phase. We completed a full test programme, and I was able to spend a lot of time in the car. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO felt good. Compared to its predecessor, it offers a larger operating window, which will hopefully help us to better adapt the car to the specific challenges that the DTM presents than last year. We are currently experimenting in this area so that we can benefit from it from the first race weekend onwards.”\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO): “I drove the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time and used the test day to get accustomed to the car.

BMW Group Plants Dingolfing and Regensburg will obtain electricity generated from renewable energy directly from their own roofs. Dingolfing’s rooftop PV system, with a capacity of 11.1 MWp, will be one of the most powerful in Germany. To achieve this objective, the premium automotive manufacturer is renting roof space at its two plant sites in Eastern Bavaria to Sunrock Holding Deutschland GmbH, which will generate electricity using photovoltaics and make it available to the plants under direct supply contracts from 2025 onwards.\n\nNicole Haft-Zboril, head of BMW Group Real Estate Management, underlined that: “With this project, we are not only creating one of Germany's biggest rooftop photovoltaic systems – we are also promoting the generation of renewable energy directly on site at BMW Group plant locations.”\n\nIn Dingolfing, photovoltaic modules cover more than 100,000 square metres of hall roof space, with an additional area of over 25,000 square metres installed in Regensburg. Together, the systems are designed to achieve an output of 14 MWp. The annual renewable electricity output is estimated at 11.3 GWh for Dingolfing and 2.9 GWh for Regensburg, which corresponds to the annual electricity needs of several thousand single-family homes.\n\nGeorg Brenninkmeijer, managing director of Sunrock Germany, said: “It is such an honour for us to collaborate with a renowned automotive company like BMW. In a sector with high energy demands, like many other industries, it is crucial to develop localised solutions to ensure a sustainable energy supply. We are delighted to start installing the PV systems in Dingolfing and Regensburg soon, which will supply the two BMW Group plants with locally produced green solar power in the future.”\n\nThe planned photovoltaic systems are scheduled to be commissioned and start supplying electricity in Regensburg as early as spring 2025, with Dingolfing targeting autumn of next year. Work will get underway at both locations in the coming months.

What a spectacular finale at the “6 Hours of Imola”, the second race of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season! Thanks to a tactical masterclass by BMW M Team WRT, the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), finished in second place. The crew of car #20 celebrated their first-ever podium in the FIA WEC – despite an early collision with another car and a repair in the pits. In the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, starting from pole position, battled for the win. After a penalty and a fantastic comeback at the end, drivers Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) celebrated a second-place finish on the podium .\n\nThe 6-hour Imola race was turbulent for all BMW M Motorsport crews. The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 started from 13th place but steadily moved up the order on the tight course. However, Rast collided with another car during an overtaking attempt, which was not his fault, severely damaging the rear wing. This required a complete rear section change during the subsequent pit stop, which the BMW M Team WRT crew accomplished in an extremely short time, thus limiting the time lost. Nevertheless, the journey from ninth place to the podium was long. To gain positions on the track, the team decided to shorten the penultimate refuelling stop, allowing them to take the lead. Van der Linde drove laps at qualifying pace to build enough time to overtake most competitors during their later final stops and cross the finish line in second place. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, with Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), started from third place and maintained that until the final hour of the race. However, the crew fell back due to performance issues and finished in sixth place.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO fought for the win right up to the finish line after an emotional rollercoaster. Al Harthy started from pole position and defended the lead during his double stint. Subsequent shifts in positions due to different strategies saw Rossi battling for first place with a Ferrari. During an overtaking attempt, he hit his opponent at the rear, for which the team received a stop-and-go penalty. That was followed by an impressive comeback by final driver van der Linde, who made up place after place and even closed the gap to the leading Porsche in the final laps. In a spectacular duel, he tried everything to snatch the victory but ultimately had to settle for second place. It was the second podium for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the second race of the season. The #31 crew with Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS), who had finished third in Qatar, experienced a troubled race this time and finished twelfth after several incidents and penalties.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to Team WRT, the drivers, and everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport on the double podium at Imola! The #20 crew did a fantastic job and, thanks to flawless performances by the drivers and perfect strategy, earned their deserved first podium in the FIA WEC. Car number 15 was performing very well for a long time after a strong qualifying, but unfortunately, it then lost performance. We need to investigate this. The podium for the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the LMGT3 class is also impressive. A podium finish in both classes and a generally strong performance of our cars – this gives us confidence for the upcoming races, where we will try to secure the first win of the year.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A great race weekend with a second place in both the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes! Additionally, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 finished sixth after encountering some issues towards the end of the race. We will investigate and find out exactly what happened. We also had various problems with car #31. It's unfortunate that it fell so far back because, by mid-race, the crew had moved up from twelfth at the start to second place. It's also frustrating for car #46, which led a large part of the race and had the speed to win – if it hadn't been for the penalty. Anyway, a double podium in the FIA WEC is always very satisfying. Next up is our home race at Spa-Francorchamps. Let's see what we can achieve there.”\n\nRené Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 2nd place): “A fantastic result – finally a podium! We didn't expect this after finishing 13th in qualifying, which didn't go as planned. But in the race, we showed how good our car and our team are. We made almost no mistakes, stayed calm, and executed well. In the end, a bit of luck was also involved, but we had so much bad luck in the last races that we now deserve to celebrate.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 6th place): “I'm happy for the #20 crew that they made it to the podium. They had a lot of bad luck last season. On our side of the garage, we can't be satisfied. Things were going well for a long time, but as the race progressed, we lost performance. Now we need to look at and understand how this happened. We all know how fast Dries is in the car. When I handed over to him, I thought it could be our day but then the problem occurred.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place LMGT3 class): “I have mixed feelings because a podium is a good result, but we could have won. It's very unfortunate because the team did a fantastic job, the car was very fast, and we managed the tyres well. Ahmad and especially Kelvin at the end drove brilliantly. Kelvin fought until the end and brought the podium home. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and hit the Ferrari in front of me during an overtaking attempt. The subsequent penalty cost us the win. I am sorry for that.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 12th place LMGT3 class): “There are races where everything just goes wrong. This was one of those races. We had a great car with great speed, but we just couldn't capitalise on it. That's hard to accept because it doesn't happen every time that you have such a strong package available. We made too many mistakes – and luck was also not on our side but the championship is still open. We now need to focus on the next race.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What a spectacular finale at the “6 Hours of Imola”, the second race of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season!

However, the crew fell back due to performance issues and finished in sixth place.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO fought for the win right up to the finish line after an emotional rollercoaster. Al Harthy started from pole position and defended the lead during his double stint. Subsequent shifts in positions due to different strategies saw Rossi battling for first place with a Ferrari. During an overtaking attempt, he hit his opponent at the rear, for which the team received a stop-and-go penalty. That was followed by an impressive comeback by final driver van der Linde, who made up place after place and even closed the gap to the leading Porsche in the final laps. In a spectacular duel, he tried everything to snatch the victory but ultimately had to settle for second place. It was the second podium for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the second race of the season. The #31 crew with Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy, and Yasser Shahin (AUS), who had finished third in Qatar, experienced a troubled race this time and finished twelfth after several incidents and penalties.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Congratulations to Team WRT, the drivers, and everyone involved at BMW M Motorsport on the double podium at Imola! The #20 crew did a fantastic job and, thanks to flawless performances by the drivers and perfect strategy, earned their deserved first podium in the FIA WEC. Car number 15 was performing very well for a long time after a strong qualifying, but unfortunately, it then lost performance. We need to investigate this. The podium for the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the LMGT3 class is also impressive. A podium finish in both classes and a generally strong performance of our cars – this gives us confidence for the upcoming races, where we will try to secure the first win of the year.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A great race weekend with a second place in both the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes! Additionally, the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 finished sixth after encountering some issues towards the end of the race. We will investigate and find out exactly what happened. We also had various problems with car #31. It's unfortunate that it fell so far back because, by mid-race, the crew had moved up from twelfth at the start to second place. It's also frustrating for car #46, which led a large part of the race and had the speed to win – if it hadn't been for the penalty. Anyway, a double podium in the FIA WEC is always very satisfying. Next up is our home race at Spa-Francorchamps. Let's see what we can achieve there.”\n\nRené Rast (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, 2nd place): “A fantastic result – finally a podium! We didn't expect this after finishing 13th in qualifying, which didn't go as planned. But in the race, we showed how good our car and our team are. We made almost no mistakes, stayed calm, and executed well. In the end, a bit of luck was also involved, but we had so much bad luck in the last races that we now deserve to celebrate.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 6th place): “I'm happy for the #20 crew that they made it to the podium. They had a lot of bad luck last season. On our side of the garage, we can't be satisfied. Things were going well for a long time, but as the race progressed, we lost performance. Now we need to look at and understand how this happened. We all know how fast Dries is in the car. When I handed over to him, I thought it could be our day but then the problem occurred.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place LMGT3 class): “I have mixed feelings because a podium is a good result, but we could have won. It's very unfortunate because the team did a fantastic job, the car was very fast, and we managed the tyres well. Ahmad and especially Kelvin at the end drove brilliantly. Kelvin fought until the end and brought the podium home. Unfortunately, I made a mistake and hit the Ferrari in front of me during an overtaking attempt. The subsequent penalty cost us the win. I am sorry for that.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 12th place LMGT3 class): “There are races where everything just goes wrong. This was one of those races. We had a great car with great speed, but we just couldn't capitalise on it. That's hard to accept because it doesn't happen every time that you have such a strong package available. We made too many mistakes – and luck was also not on our side but the championship is still open. We now need to focus on the next race.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "FIA WEC, BMW M Motorsport, LMDh, GT Racing, Customer Racing"}]}

Thanks to a tactical masterclass by BMW M Team WRT, the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), finished in second place.Imola. What a spectacular finale at the “6 Hours of Imola”, the second race of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) season! Thanks to a tactical masterclass by BMW M Team WRT, the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), finished in second place. The crew of car #20 celebrated their first-ever podium in the FIA WEC – despite an early collision with another car and a repair in the pits. In the LMGT3 class, the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, starting from pole position, battled for the win. After a penalty and a fantastic comeback at the end, drivers Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) celebrated a second-place finish on the podium .\n\nThe 6-hour Imola race was turbulent for all BMW M Motorsport crews. The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 started from 13th place but steadily moved up the order on the tight course. However, Rast collided with another car during an overtaking attempt, which was not his fault, severely damaging the rear wing. This required a complete rear section change during the subsequent pit stop, which the BMW M Team WRT crew accomplished in an extremely short time, thus limiting the time lost. Nevertheless, the journey from ninth place to the podium was long. To gain positions on the track, the team decided to shorten the penultimate refuelling stop, allowing them to take the lead. Van der Linde drove laps at qualifying pace to build enough time to overtake most competitors during their later final stops and cross the finish line in second place. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, with Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), started from third place and maintained that until the final hour of the race.

BMW M Motorsport embarks on the most spectacular racing week of the year with the slogan “BMW M is back at Le Mans”. Exactly 25 years after the victory of the BMW V12 LMR, the start of the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the Hypercar class marks the return of the BMW brand to the top category at the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 will play a very special role as it competes as the 20th BMW Art Car. Designed by the internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu, the car will be a highlight in the paddock. In the LMGT3 class of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC), two BMW M4 GT3s will compete for victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe.\n\nIn the Hypercar class, BMW M Team WRT and six BMW M works drivers face what is probably the toughest competition in current motorsport. 23 Hypercars from nine manufacturers are registered for the endurance highlight of the year. In the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) will take turns driving. The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car will be raced by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). The design of the 20th BMW Art Car by Julie Mehretu was unveiled on May 21 at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (FRA). It was created based on one of the artist’s works as a “performative painting.” More details can be found in the BMW M Motorsport Media Guide: \n\nIn the LMGT3 category, Team WRT fields two BMW M4 GT3s in new liveries. The #31 BMW M4 GT3 will be driven by the winners of the 6 Hours of Imola (ITA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR). The #46 car will be shared by Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA).\n\nHistory of BMW at Le Mans.\n\nOn the occasion of the comeback in the top class after 25 years, BMW is also celebrating its history at Le Mans. Legendary vehicles such as the BMW V12 LMR winning car from 1999 and the BMW 3.0 CSL Art Car by Alexander Calder from 1975 can be admired by the more than 300,000 expected fans.\n\nBMW’s first successful start at Le Mans took place back in 1939 with a BMW 328 Touring Coupé. It won its class and finished fifth overall. It wasn’t until the 1970s that BMW once again made waves at Le Mans, especially with the invention of the BMW Art Cars by Jochen Neerpasch and Hervé Poulain. The Calder Art Car debuted in 1975. That was followed by the BMW 3.0 CSL by Frank Stella in 1976, the BMW 320i Turbo by Roy Lichtenstein in 1977, and the BMW M1 by Andy Warhol in 1979. Other BMW Art Cars at Le Mans included the BMW V12 LMR by Jenny Holzer in 1999 and the BMW M3 GT2 by Jeff Koons in 2010.\n\nBMW M Motorsport achieved its greatest sporting successes in the 1990s. Above all stands the overall victory for Yannick Dalmas (FRA), Pierluigi Martini (ITA), and Joachim Winkelhock (GER) in the #15 BMW V12 LMR in 1999. By 1995, a car powered by a BMW engine had already won, namely the BMW McLaren F1 GTR. Most recently, BMW M Motorsport competed in 2018 and 2019 with the BMW M8 GTE.\n\nThe following link contains video interviews with preview statements from all Hypercar drivers, as well as from Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, and Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \n\nFurther quotes before the 24 Hours of Le Mans:\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “It is the fourth time that we go to Le Mans, but it will be our debut in the top class. Just to be there, defending the colours of a top manufacturer such as BMW, and bringing the largest entry we have ever brought to Le Mans, makes us proud of what we have achieved as a team. Still, this is a reflection that keeps our minds busy for no more than a couple of minutes. The really important thing is the competition ahead of us. In Hypercar, it is difficult to tell what our ambitions can be. We have had a start of the season that was eventful and promising at the same time. It’s difficult to make predictions until we’re on track at Le Mans. That’s when we’ll know where we stand. Concerning the LMGT3 the objective is to make up the points lost at Spa. We won on strategy at Imola but were very unlucky at Spa. We had an ideal plan to arrive at Le Mans leading the standings, and this is not the case, so the objective is to close the gap here. We have a competitive car and great drivers, so we’ll aim at making a perfect and faultless race. We all know that in 24-hour races that generally pays off.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3): “I have unfinished business with Le Mans, as I always had bad luck there during my time with BMW M Motorsport and could never finish the race. I want to change that this time, of course. Our BMW M4 GT3 has shown very strong pace in the first FIA WEC races of the season, even though we unfortunately couldn’t convert that into points recently at Spa-Francorchamps. I think, with an experienced team like WRT, we can go into the 24 Hours of Le Mans with high expectations.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3): “The big moment has arrived, and it will be my first time at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the most famous race in the world. I am very happy and proud to be associated with BMW and Team WRT for this big race. I have known the track since last year, having participated in the Road to Le Mans race, and I like the Circuit de La Sarthe a lot. We’ll be there for a long week and we are ready. We had some good performances in the first races of the season, but now we need to understand our level, speed, and competitiveness at Le Mans. We hope to be strong and I cannot wait to live this experience!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW M Motorsport embarks on the most spectacular racing week of the year with the slogan “BMW M is back at Le Mans”.

Designed by the internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu, the car will be a highlight in the paddock. In the LMGT3 class of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC), two BMW M4 GT3s will compete for victory at the Circuit de la Sarthe.\n\nIn the Hypercar class, BMW M Team WRT and six BMW M works drivers face what is probably the toughest competition in current motorsport. 23 Hypercars from nine manufacturers are registered for the endurance highlight of the year. In the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) will take turns driving. The #20 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car will be raced by Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). The design of the 20th BMW Art Car by Julie Mehretu was unveiled on May 21 at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (FRA). It was created based on one of the artist’s works as a “performative painting.” More details can be found in the BMW M Motorsport Media Guide: \n\nIn the LMGT3 category, Team WRT fields two BMW M4 GT3s in new liveries. The #31 BMW M4 GT3 will be driven by the winners of the 6 Hours of Imola (ITA), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR). The #46 car will be shared by Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA).\n\nHistory of BMW at Le Mans.\n\nOn the occasion of the comeback in the top class after 25 years, BMW is also celebrating its history at Le Mans. Legendary vehicles such as the BMW V12 LMR winning car from 1999 and the BMW 3.0 CSL Art Car by Alexander Calder from 1975 can be admired by the more than 300,000 expected fans.\n\nBMW’s first successful start at Le Mans took place back in 1939 with a BMW 328 Touring Coupé. It won its class and finished fifth overall. It wasn’t until the 1970s that BMW once again made waves at Le Mans, especially with the invention of the BMW Art Cars by Jochen Neerpasch and Hervé Poulain. The Calder Art Car debuted in 1975. That was followed by the BMW 3.0 CSL by Frank Stella in 1976, the BMW 320i Turbo by Roy Lichtenstein in 1977, and the BMW M1 by Andy Warhol in 1979. Other BMW Art Cars at Le Mans included the BMW V12 LMR by Jenny Holzer in 1999 and the BMW M3 GT2 by Jeff Koons in 2010.\n\nBMW M Motorsport achieved its greatest sporting successes in the 1990s. Above all stands the overall victory for Yannick Dalmas (FRA), Pierluigi Martini (ITA), and Joachim Winkelhock (GER) in the #15 BMW V12 LMR in 1999. By 1995, a car powered by a BMW engine had already won, namely the BMW McLaren F1 GTR. Most recently, BMW M Motorsport competed in 2018 and 2019 with the BMW M8 GTE.\n\nThe following link contains video interviews with preview statements from all Hypercar drivers, as well as from Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, and Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \n\nFurther quotes before the 24 Hours of Le Mans:\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “It is the fourth time that we go to Le Mans, but it will be our debut in the top class. Just to be there, defending the colours of a top manufacturer such as BMW, and bringing the largest entry we have ever brought to Le Mans, makes us proud of what we have achieved as a team. Still, this is a reflection that keeps our minds busy for no more than a couple of minutes. The really important thing is the competition ahead of us. In Hypercar, it is difficult to tell what our ambitions can be. We have had a start of the season that was eventful and promising at the same time. It’s difficult to make predictions until we’re on track at Le Mans. That’s when we’ll know where we stand. Concerning the LMGT3 the objective is to make up the points lost at Spa. We won on strategy at Imola but were very unlucky at Spa. We had an ideal plan to arrive at Le Mans leading the standings, and this is not the case, so the objective is to close the gap here. We have a competitive car and great drivers, so we’ll aim at making a perfect and faultless race. We all know that in 24-hour races that generally pays off.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3): “I have unfinished business with Le Mans, as I always had bad luck there during my time with BMW M Motorsport and could never finish the race. I want to change that this time, of course. Our BMW M4 GT3 has shown very strong pace in the first FIA WEC races of the season, even though we unfortunately couldn’t convert that into points recently at Spa-Francorchamps. I think, with an experienced team like WRT, we can go into the 24 Hours of Le Mans with high expectations.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3): “The big moment has arrived, and it will be my first time at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the most famous race in the world. I am very happy and proud to be associated with BMW and Team WRT for this big race. I have known the track since last year, having participated in the Road to Le Mans race, and I like the Circuit de La Sarthe a lot. We’ll be there for a long week and we are ready. We had some good performances in the first races of the season, but now we need to understand our level, speed, and competitiveness at Le Mans. We hope to be strong and I cannot wait to live this experience!”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

As it transitions from natural gas to renewable energy, the BMW Group is gradually electrifying its paint shops as part of its efforts to decarbonise vehicle production. A recently concluded pilot project at Plant Regensburg demonstrates how this transition can be simplified and accelerated. The key lies in the installation of a thermal oil system. Using thermal oil as a heat transfer medium enables heat generation to be decoupled from the rest of the system’s components. This allows the energy supply to the coating lines to be adapted flexibly at any time.\n\n“One advantage of switching to thermal oil is the flexibility to choose the energy source for heat generation in our paint shops. For example, thermal oil can be heated using electricity, geothermal energy, solar thermal energy – or even a hydrogen-powered heating system. The ability to change fuels quickly at any time makes our paint shops more resilient. If an energy source becomes scarce or unavailable, we can respond at short notice,” explains Samuel Flieger, project manager for technical planning in the Regensburg paint shop.\n\nThis means paint shops can already be set up to run on renewable energy – even if gas-free heating is not yet an option. The power grid is not currently equipped at all locations to handle the high energy demands of a fully electrified paint shop, largely due to its extremely energy-intensive drying processes. A thermal oil-based system can also be operated with gas as an interim solution.\n\nTesting successfully concluded in Regensburg\n\nThe Regensburg pilot project team took advantage of the production downtime over the New Year period to install the thermal oil technology. Within just a few days, they replaced the gas-powered drying equipment used for one of the three top coat lines with an electrically heated thermal oil system – complete with an innovative electric-powered eRTO exhaust air unit.\n\nThe key innovation lies in using the new electric heating unit to transfer heat to the thermal oil, instead of directly heating the air around the car bodies in the drying chamber after paint application. The heated oil circulates in a closed loop and, in a second step, heats the air in the drying chamber via heat exchangers. The circulating thermal oil reaches temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius. Unlike water, it remains stable even at these high temperatures.\n\nRetrofitting boosts energy efficiency\n\nWherever waste heat is generated, it is recovered and reused as process heat. This reduces the temperature of the exhaust air released through the hall's roof. As a result of these retrofitting measures, the drying equipment’s total energy consumption has been reduced by approximately 40 percent. Switching to thermal oil heating, combined with the system's improved energy efficiency, will reduce the carbon footprint of BMW Group Plant Regensburg’s paint shop by approximately 480 tons of CO2e per year.\n\nBMW Group Plants Regensburg and Wackersdorf The BMW Group vehicle plant in Regensburg has been in operation since 1986 and is one of more than 30 BMW Group production locations worldwide. Every workday, around 1,400 vehicles of the BMW X1 and BMW X2 models roll off the production line at Plant Regensburg, destined for customers around the globe. Different types of drive trains are flexibly manufactured on a single production line – ranging from vehicles with internal combustion engines to plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models.\n\nBMW Group Plant Regensburg was recognised as “FACTORY OF THE YEAR” 2024 in the category “excellent large-series assembly” of the prestigious industrial competition. As it implements the so-called BMW iFACTORY, the BMW Group is focused on digitalisation of the Regensburg plant site to create a digital and intelligently connected factory.

Employees of the future Plant Debrecen have moved into the central Communication Centre, where they are joining forces for the final stretch before the official series launch of the NEUE KLASSE. Debrecen Plant Director Hans-Peter Kemser is pleased with construction progress: “In just a few months, pre-series production will get underway here in Debrecen, setting new standards – not just for the vehicles themselves, but also for processes here at the plant. The Communication Centre will support us by creating short lines of communication and enabling a good exchange of information between all technologies at any time.” The architecture also supports the concept of the BMW iFACTORY, which will be fully implemented in Debrecen.\n\nWhile non-production employees are already settling into their workplaces on-site, production staff are preparing for their future roles at Plant Debrecen within the company’s global production network. This will ensure a smooth start to pre-series production in 2024 and the successful series launch of the first NEUE KLASSE model in 2025.\n\nModel of Leipzig central building further optimised\n\nInspired by the central building at BMW Group Plant Leipzig, the Communication Centre in Debrecen will also link the production technologies of the body shop, paint shop and assembly. In Debrecen, this underlying principle was further developed with the creation of a central building where the network idea is paramount. The open architecture provides both meeting spaces and sequestered workplaces. The two-storey Communication Centre is about 19,000 square metres in size; around half of this area will be office space.\n\nThe three main production areas are situated around the administrative area. The Communication Centre is not just where colleagues come together, but also people and products: From the body shop, which is adjacent to the office building on the right, unpainted car bodies will make their way on a conveyor belt, visible above people's heads, through the Communication Centre to the paint shop, located centrally behind it. From there, the painted bodies will be transported back through the office building to the vehicle assembly, which is to the left. This means that everyone who does not work directly in production can still see the product at all times.\n\nThe multifunctional staff restaurant can also be used for meetings outside of mealtimes. This is located on the ground floor as well, along with the central marketplace and health centre. A state-of-the-art laboratory also found home in the Communication Center's ground floor area in 1,300 square meters. The colleagues of the laboratory will be responsible for the premium quality of the colors of the Neue Klasse models.

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection, the BMW Art Car World Tour is taking place on all five continents with numerous accompanying activities and kicks off in Europe and Asia. The official start of the world tour was celebrated yesterday as part of the “(R) EVOLUTION OF ART” event at the BMW Group Niederlassung Wien. A total of five BMW Art Cars will be shown in Vienna at the Museum of Applied Arts and at the SPARK Art Fair from March 20-23: the cars by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Jeff Koons. The latest and 20th BMW Art Car – the BMW M Hybrid V8 by renowned American painter Julie Mehretu – will embark on an Asian tour and be displayed at Art Basel in Hong Kong on March 28-30.\n\n“We are honored to be able to host the start of the BMW Art Car World Tour in Vienna,” says Dr. Josef Reiter, Managing Director of BMW Group Niederlassung Wien. “As the BMW Group in Austria, we see it as our responsibility to promote art and culture. The (R) EVOLUTION OF ART event is part of our commitment to provide creative impulses and inspire dialogue between artists, their works of art and audiences. We believe that innovation and creativity are inextricably linked — just as in the development of our cars. Art appeals to emotions — just like a BMW.

BMW, distributed by Borusan Otomotiv in Türkiye, is exhibiting the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA at the 19th edition of Contemporary Istanbul, open for General Admission between October 24-27th, 2024, with a Preview Day on October 23rd. The installation, which had its world premiere at the Frieze Los Angeles art fair, will be on view for art enthusiasts at Tersane Istanbul.\n\nThe BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA combines the innovative color-changing technology developed by BMW with the traditional art of renowned South African artist Esther Mahlangu. The first woman and the first African artist to participate in the BMW Art Car project, Mahlangu’s signature colors and patterns are generated in constantly changing compositions on the surface of the vehicle through sections of attached film that can be electronically animated. This technology transforms the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA from just a vehicle into a dynamic work of art.\n\nThe BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA uses the BMW Group's latest color-changing technology. The E Ink film technology, which is sensitive to electrical charges, enables the surface of the vehicle to display a variety of ever-changing colors. This technology expands Mahlangu's art with a dynamic dimension, offering viewers a continuously evolving visual experience. Inspired by Mahlangu during the idea phase, Dr. Stella Clarke, Research Engineer Open Innovations at the BMW Group and the implementer of E Ink technology, brought the concept of a color-changing car to life and was working with the artist on the project.\n\nThis visual experience is accompanied by a sound performance composed by Renzo Vitale, BMW Group's Creative Director for Sound. Vitale incorporates sounds from Mahlangu’s homeland culture and the sounds from feather brushes she uses for painting to create a soundscape in harmony with the visuality of the work. Thus, the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA stands out as an installation that appeals to both the visual and auditory senses.\n\nThis project once again demonstrates the importance that BMW places on art and technology. The BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA offers a unique experience that will appeal to both art lovers and technology enthusiasts alike.\n\nBorusan Otomotiv CEO Hakan Tiftik stated that BMW, distributed by Borusan Otomotiv in Türkiye, has been a long-standing supporter of Contemporary Istanbul, one of the leading contemporary art events in the country. Tiftik said, “Borusan Group, the parent company of Borusan Otomotiv, has been a prominent follower and supporter of cultural and artistic events since its foundation. The owner of Borusan Contemporary Art Collection, one of the foremost collections in Türkiye, Borusan Group continues its activities in the field of contemporary art under the roof of “Borusan Contemporary” at the Perili Köşk building, the headquarters of Borusan Holding. We are excited to participate in this year’s Contemporary Istanbul with the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, which reflects the BMW brand’s commitment to supporting numerous events across various art disciplines. Featuring Esther Mahlangu’s original art, the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, showcases one of the most advanced color-changing technologies to automotive and art enthusiasts. We are also pleased to welcome the implementer of this technology, Dr. Stella Clarke, who worked with Mahlangu on the project, in Istanbul.”\n\n\"The Electric AI Canvas\" was the highlight of last year’s fairBringing together world-renowned artists and original works with art enthusiasts at Contemporary Istanbul, BMW Türkiye showcased the all-electric new BMW i5 model with the \"The Electric AI Canvas\" installation last year. Inspired by the new BMW i5, \"The Electric AI Canvas\" was designed with custom artificial intelligence generated animations, created using AI models trained with a dataset of works from renowned contemporary artists. Esther Mahlangu was among the artists involved in transforming the new BMW i5 into a work of art.\n\nAbout Esther Mahlangu Esther Mahlangu is a highly regarded artist known for reinterpreting traditional South African Ndebele art and culture in modern forms. In 1991, she became the first woman and the first African artist to participate in the BMW Art Car Project, designing the BMW 525i. Mahlangu's vibrant and geometric patterns are combined with innovative color-changing technology in the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, creating a work of contemporary art that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i5 eDrive40:Power consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 18.9 - 15.9 kWh/100 kmElectric range in WLTP cycle: 497 – 582 km"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW, distributed by Borusan Otomotiv in Türkiye, is exhibiting the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA at the 19th edition of Contemporary Istanbul, open for General Admission between October 24-27th, 2024, with a Preview Day on October 23rd.

The installation, which had its world premiere at the Frieze Los Angeles art fair, will be on view for art enthusiasts at Tersane Istanbul.Munich/Istanbul. BMW, distributed by Borusan Otomotiv in Türkiye, is exhibiting the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA at the 19th edition of Contemporary Istanbul, open for General Admission between October 24-27th, 2024, with a Preview Day on October 23rd. The installation, which had its world premiere at the Frieze Los Angeles art fair, will be on view for art enthusiasts at Tersane Istanbul.\n\nThe BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA combines the innovative color-changing technology developed by BMW with the traditional art of renowned South African artist Esther Mahlangu. The first woman and the first African artist to participate in the BMW Art Car project, Mahlangu’s signature colors and patterns are generated in constantly changing compositions on the surface of the vehicle through sections of attached film that can be electronically animated. This technology transforms the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA from just a vehicle into a dynamic work of art.\n\nThe BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA uses the BMW Group's latest color-changing technology. The E Ink film technology, which is sensitive to electrical charges, enables the surface of the vehicle to display a variety of ever-changing colors. This technology expands Mahlangu's art with a dynamic dimension, offering viewers a continuously evolving visual experience. Inspired by Mahlangu during the idea phase, Dr. Stella Clarke, Research Engineer Open Innovations at the BMW Group and the implementer of E Ink technology, brought the concept of a color-changing car to life and was working with the artist on the project.\n\nThis visual experience is accompanied by a sound performance composed by Renzo Vitale, BMW Group's Creative Director for Sound. Vitale incorporates sounds from Mahlangu’s homeland culture and the sounds from feather brushes she uses for painting to create a soundscape in harmony with the visuality of the work. Thus, the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA stands out as an installation that appeals to both the visual and auditory senses.\n\nThis project once again demonstrates the importance that BMW places on art and technology. The BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA offers a unique experience that will appeal to both art lovers and technology enthusiasts alike.\n\nBorusan Otomotiv CEO Hakan Tiftik stated that BMW, distributed by Borusan Otomotiv in Türkiye, has been a long-standing supporter of Contemporary Istanbul, one of the leading contemporary art events in the country. Tiftik said, “Borusan Group, the parent company of Borusan Otomotiv, has been a prominent follower and supporter of cultural and artistic events since its foundation. The owner of Borusan Contemporary Art Collection, one of the foremost collections in Türkiye, Borusan Group continues its activities in the field of contemporary art under the roof of “Borusan Contemporary” at the Perili Köşk building, the headquarters of Borusan Holding. We are excited to participate in this year’s Contemporary Istanbul with the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, which reflects the BMW brand’s commitment to supporting numerous events across various art disciplines. Featuring Esther Mahlangu’s original art, the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, showcases one of the most advanced color-changing technologies to automotive and art enthusiasts. We are also pleased to welcome the implementer of this technology, Dr. Stella Clarke, who worked with Mahlangu on the project, in Istanbul.”\n\n\"The Electric AI Canvas\" was the highlight of last year’s fairBringing together world-renowned artists and original works with art enthusiasts at Contemporary Istanbul, BMW Türkiye showcased the all-electric new BMW i5 model with the \"The Electric AI Canvas\" installation last year. Inspired by the new BMW i5, \"The Electric AI Canvas\" was designed with custom artificial intelligence generated animations, created using AI models trained with a dataset of works from renowned contemporary artists. Esther Mahlangu was among the artists involved in transforming the new BMW i5 into a work of art.\n\nAbout Esther Mahlangu Esther Mahlangu is a highly regarded artist known for reinterpreting traditional South African Ndebele art and culture in modern forms. In 1991, she became the first woman and the first African artist to participate in the BMW Art Car Project, designing the BMW 525i. Mahlangu's vibrant and geometric patterns are combined with innovative color-changing technology in the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, creating a work of contemporary art that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i5 eDrive40:Power consumption combined in WLTP cycle: 18.9 - 15.9 kWh/100 kmElectric range in WLTP cycle: 497 – 582 km"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA at Contemporary Istanbul.

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nSporting elegance to the power of 4. The epitome of driving pleasure in the premium midsize class.\n\nWhen it comes to the premium segment of the midsize class, the number 4 stands for the perfect combination of driving pleasure and elegantly sporty design. These have been hallmark brand values of BMW since its earliest days, and the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible embody them even more intently than ever. The precisely modified exterior design of the two models underscores their dynamic character and exclusive style. Modern touches and new equipment features bring a premium ambience of renewed sophistication to the interior. Here, the cutting-edge cockpit design, including the BMW Curved Display, provides the ideal stage for the latest evolution of BMW iDrive with QuickSelect, which is based on the new BMW Operating System 8.5.\n\nNew exterior paint finishes and light-alloy wheels, headlights with an extremely striking design for the light sources and the now optionally available Laserlight rear lights mark out the latest advances in the exterior of the two models. Step inside the sporting two-door models and the key new features of the cabin are immediately apparent: the revised design of the steering wheels and instrument panel, the seat coverings, the interior trim elements and the now optionally available CraftedClarity glass applications for selected controls. Alongside the introduction of the new BMW iDrive with QuickSelect as standard, customers can now also choose to add an Augmented View display for the BMW Maps navigation system as an option on their new BMW 4 Series.\n\nProduction of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible will remain at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, which is also the birthplace of many other executive class and luxury segment cars from the brand, as well as the BMW 8 Series sports car and the high-performance BMW M4 models. Its worldwide market launch will get underway in March 2024.\n\nGlobal segment leaders sharpen the sporting profile of the BMW brand.\n\nThe evolution of the BMW 4 Series range is anchored in the product substance that has helped it achieve such outstanding popularity across all the major car markets. In a market dominated by German premium carmakers, the coupé and convertible enjoy clear leads in their respective segments both globally and in their key individual markets.\n\nThe most important sales markets for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are the USA, Germany and China. Since the market launch of the current model generation of the BMW 4 Series Coupé, the US market has recorded the strongest demand. The BMW 4 Series Convertible has also been most popular in the USA to date.\n\nThis sales success has been accompanied by an extraordinarily high level of customer satisfaction. In customer surveys, both the BMW 4 Series Coupé and BMW 4 Series Convertible achieve excellent approval ratings. Customers placed particular emphasis on the dynamic driving characteristics and emotionally rich design of both models, as well as a premium feel characterised by high material and build quality. By attracting such positive responses from customers, the BMW 4 Series models have made a significant contribution to further enhancing the brand’s profile as a maker of dynamically exceptional and elegantly sporty premium cars.\n\nDistinct characters with a shared focus on driving pleasure.\n\nFor the past two model generations, BMW has grouped its premium midsize coupés and convertibles into their own model range. This has highlighted their particularly intense focus on delivering the driving pleasure for which the brand is renowned. The differentiation between the new BMW 4 Series models and the BMW 3 Series in terms of design can be found not only in their proportions and lines, but also their distinctive front-end visuals. Wider tracks and specific tuning for their chassis technology lay the groundwork for superlative dynamic prowess. Within the BMW 4 Series range, the coupé and convertible models represent distinct characters whose individual vehicle concepts target different priorities.\n\nThe BMW 4 Series Coupé combines its dynamically flowing lines and elegantly stretched proportions with a body optimised for extra handling agility and boasting exceptional torsional rigidity, plus a chassis tuned squarely for dynamic excellence. The individual-seat character of the two rear seats helps to ensure that the passengers in the second row also enjoy an intense driving experience. The folding function of the three-section split rear seat bench increases the versatility of the interior when it comes to accommodating items for leisure activities and longer trips away.\n\nMeanwhile, passengers in the BMW 4 Series Convertible’s four seats can sample the sporty driving experience characteristic of the 4 Series together with the joy of open-top motoring. A particularly stylish sense of elegance, for which the car’s low-slung silhouette is principally responsible, also comes as standard. A highlight feature specific to the BMW 4 Series Convertible is its panel bow soft-top roof, which combines the solidity of a retractable hardtop with the classical aesthetic of a fabric hood. The roof’s electric drive mechanism can be activated while travelling at up to 50 km/h (31 mph); the opening/closing process takes 18 seconds.\n\nTaking steps to further reduce the company’s carbon footprint.\n\nHighly efficient engines, intelligent lightweight design and optimised aerodynamic attributes make a significant contribution to enhancing driving pleasure in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, at the same time as lowering fuel consumption and emissions. Meanwhile, the 48V mild hybrid technology deployed on certain models sharpens power delivery and improves efficiency. As well as the bonnet, front side panels and doors, numerous chassis components are also made from aluminium. And with a Cd as low as 0.25 in the case of the coupé and as low as 0.27 for the convertible, the two models can claim an impressive drag coefficient.\n\nIn the interests of creating an even more sustainable overall concept, growing importance is attached to the use of secondary raw materials –alongside further optimised use of materials and energy-optimised production methods. For the BMW brand, the twin goals of increasing sustainability and achieving premium standards are inextricably linked, rather than competing factors.\n\nExterior design. Striking visual cues point the way to captivating dynamics.\n\nSporting potency and elegance are the key themes reflected with authenticity in the design of the BMW 4 Series models. Precise modifications to their exterior visuals enable the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible to express their unique characters even more clearly. The new features sharpen the profile of the two models and provide eye-catching pointers to their captivating dynamics, exclusivity and technological advances.\n\nWith their distinctive lines and clean surface treatment in the brand’s modern design language, the coupé and convertible members of the BMW 4 Series line-up exude driving pleasure and inimitable style. The features of the optional M Sport package add further punch to the cars’ dynamic appearance. They include a diffuser element in the lower section of the rear bumper, which is now painted in Black high-gloss. In addition, the exhaust tailpipes integrated into the rear apron on the left and right have grown from 90 millimetres to 100 millimetres in diameter. As an extension to the M Sport package, customers can also order their cars with the M Sport package Pro and M Carbon exterior package.\n\nNewly designed headlights, innovative Laserlight rear lights.\n\nDesign cues specific to the BMW 4 Series include the visually powerful front end shaped by slim LED headlights and a vertically arranged BMW kidney grille. The air intakes of the strikingly forward-angled grille have a mesh structure, both in standard form and if the M Sport package is specified. Their surround now comes in matt chrome.\n\nThe new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible also feature visually and functionally upgraded headlights. The LED units in their inner workings, which provide all the light functions, have been redesigned and have a new structure. Low and high beam are generated from a single LED module. And a pair of vertical and subtly arrow-shaped LED units house the side light, daytime driving light and turn signal indicator functions. The technically focused look of the new light sources gives the headlights a high-quality and progressive appearance.\n\nAdaptive LED Headlights with non-dazzling matrix high beam are available as an option. They can be identified by blue inlays and include urban lights and a cornering light function. The prism structure of the LED units for the urban lights provides a striking contrast against the uniform illumination of the daytime driving light units.\n\nAlso offered as part of the M Sport package Pro and if the Adaptive LED Headlights are specified are M Shadowline lights with dark inner accents. If the optional Comfort Access is fitted, the headlights generate a Welcome Light Animation once the driver and vehicle key come within three metres of the car.\n\nExamples of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible specified with Adaptive LED Headlights are also fitted with super-expressive Laserlight rear lights. This model-specific version of an innovative lighting effect employs a technology first seen in the BMW M4 CSL high-performance special edition produced in a limited run of 1,000 examples. Here, laser diodes each illuminate a fibre optic bundle, giving the rear units an intricate light graphic. The precise lines of the three-dimensional Laserlight gives these rear lights – which are making their debut in a volume-produced car – an exclusive and unmistakable design.\n\nNew exterior paint shades and light-alloy wheels.\n\nCustomers can give the outside of their new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible a personal touch with a choice of two solid and eight metallic paint finishes. Cape York Green metallic and Fire Red metallic are new additions to the range. And a wide variety of BMW Individual paint finishes and BMW Individual special paint finishes are also offered.\n\nAttractive new additions can also be found in the selection of optional light-alloy wheels. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are both offered for the first time with three new 19-inch variants. The new M light-alloy wheels in double-spoke design can be ordered in either Jet Black or a bi-colour finish. And the new BMW Individual light-alloy wheels also have a Y-spoke design and are finished in Midnight Grey.\n\nInterior and equipment. Progressive style and an aura of carefully honed refinement.\n\nStandard-fitted sport seats and newly designed steering wheels feed into the intensity of the driving experience in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible. The large BMW Curved Display brings a fresh and particularly modern interpretation of the driver focus for which the brand is renowned. High-quality, meticulously crafted materials and a new operating concept for ventilation and climate control systems add to the cockpit’s premium allure. The modifications carried out to the interior of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible ensure those on board can enjoy driving pleasure with progressive style and long-distance comfort in an ambience of carefully honed refinement.\n\nAmong the cutting-edge new features is a version of the optionally available seat surfaces that is making its debut in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and is produced using more sustainable methods. Added to which, new interior trim strips are available for both the coupé and convertible. And standard specification now also includes ambient lighting and electrically folding exterior mirrors. The range of optional equipment has been restructured to enable particularly targeted individualisation.\n\nNew steering wheels with standard gearshift paddles.\n\nThe latest-generation steering wheels available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible stand out with their modern and sporty design. As standard, the driver will find in front of them a newly designed sports leather steering wheel with a polygonal rim and two spokes. The M Sport package now brings an M leather steering wheel in three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim and a discreet centre marking.\n\nBoth versions of the newly designed steering wheels have illuminated multifunction buttons and gearshift paddles. Now fitted as standard, the paddles enable particularly swift manual interventions in the gear selection process and underscore the sharper sporting profile of the new BMW 4 Series models.\n\nDetail revisions for the instrument panel, digital climate control.\n\nThe introduction of the upgraded BMW iDrive with QuickSelect also brings improved operation of the ventilation and climate control functions in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and in the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. This is a prime example of advanced digitalisation at work and enables a further reduction in the number of physical buttons and controls in the cockpit. Temperature selection, intensity of ventilation and – if the relevant features are specified – seat and steering wheel heating can now be adjusted by touch via the BMW Curved Display or by voice command with the help of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. New adjustment controls for the air vent grilles in the centre of the instrument panel and on the driver’s and front passenger side of the cockpit allow the direction of airflow to be adjusted using rotating and tilting movements. Specifying optional Sensatec trim for the instrument panel means customers will now find a further refined surface structure which further highlights the interior’s modern premium ambience.\n\nThe standard ambient lighting in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible now also includes contour lighting integrated into the trim around the central seam vents. Like the lighting for the footwells, the storage compartment in the front section of the centre console and the door openers, this can be adjusted for colour and brightness according to personal preference. Users can choose from nine colours. The functionality of the interior lighting also includes an atmospheric Welcome and Goodbye Animation and light signals indicating an open door or incoming phone call.\n\nPremiere for M Performtex seat covers in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé.\n\nThe standard-fit sport seats combine with interior surfaces in Sensatec perforated. The Vernasca leather trim with decorative quilting available as an option for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and for the new BMW 4 Series Convertible is now also offered in the new bi-colour variant Black/Red. And both models can also be specified with BMW Individual Merino leather trim in three colours.\n\nWhen ordered with the M Sport package or in M Performance form, the new BMW 4 Series Coupé comes with seat surfaces in black M Performtex. Making its debut in a BMW model, this velours covering combines high material quality and a sporty design with low weight and a sustainability-optimised production method.\n\nNew interior trim strips, exclusive touches with CraftedClarity.\n\nThe selection of available interior trim strips has also been extensively revised, with Dark Graphite matt now standard specification for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible. The M Sport package includes interior trim strips in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite. Also on the options list are Fineline Light open-pored and Grey Blue Ash open-pored fine-wood trim, and M interior trim carbon fibre.\n\nThe use of extremely high-quality materials also allows distinctive touches to be included in other areas of the interior to enhance its modern premium character. Electroplated applications for the control panel in the doors, which includes the window controls and locking switch, are available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. And customers can also specify CraftedClarity glass applications – another new addition to the options list. These give the gear selector lever, BMW iDrive Controller and Start/Stop button a particular air of exclusivity, both visually and in how they feel to the touch.\n\nPowertrain and driving experience.Powerful, efficient and supremely assured.\n\nThe line-up of powertrains for the new BMW 4 Series range comprises powerful and highly efficient petrol and diesel engines featuring BMW TwinPower Turbo technology and electrification in the form of 48V mild hybrid technology. All the drive units deliver an exceptional blend of sporting driving pleasure and fuel economy, all are part of the current modular generation of Efficient Dynamics engines and all are mated to an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission as standard. The shift paddles on the steering wheel, which also come as standard in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, allow quick manual interventions in the gear selection process, adding to the dynamic driving experience.\n\nStraight-six engines can be found under the bonnet of the M Performance versions in both model series (see separate chapter), as well as in the new BMW 430d xDrive Coupé and BMW 430d Convertible, whose diesel unit has an output of 210 kW/286 hp. The line-up also includes two four-cylinder petrol engines developing 135 kW/184 hp and 180 kW/245 hp respectively and a 140 kW/190 hp four-cylinder diesel. The engine’s power is fed to the road via either classical rear-wheel drive or the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system, depending on the model variant.\n\nMild hybrid technology optimises power delivery and efficiency.\n\nAll the six-cylinder in-line engines available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, as well as the four-cylinder diesel unit, come with 48V mild hybrid technology for sharper power delivery and greater efficiency. The auxiliary electric drive takes the form of a 48V starter generator and makes output of 8 kW/11 hp instantly available in response to the slightest movement of the accelerator. This electric boost enhances the drive system’s dynamic response when accelerating off the line and putting in mid-range bursts of speed. The electric drive unit also assists the engine when travelling at a constant speed, allowing it to operate within an efficiency-optimised load range as often as possible.\n\nThe mild hybrid system additionally allows the use of electric power recuperated via Brake Energy Regeneration and stored in a 48V battery. The energy harvested efficiently in this way is not only used for the auxiliary electric drive, but also fed to the 12V electrical system with the help of a voltage transformer. This allows the vehicle’s electrical consumers to be operated even more efficiently.\n\nBespoke chassis technology for a sporty driving experience.\n\nExcellent body rigidity, intelligent lightweight design, 50 : 50 weight distribution and optimised aerodynamic properties provide an ideal basis for endowing the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible with remarkably agile and dynamic handling abilities. This is further helped by sophisticated chassis technology that has been tuned precisely for the weight spread at hand.\n\nLift-related dampers refine the balance between captivating sporting prowess and superb long-distance comfort. Various options are available for customising the car’s character, including M Sport suspension, adaptive M suspension with variable sport steering, and M Sport brakes.\n\nWide variety of systems for automated driving and parking.\n\nThe range of systems for automated driving and parking is just as extensive. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are fitted as standard with the front collision warning system with brake intervention, Cruise Control with brake function, Speed Limit Info with no-overtaking indicator, manual Speed Limit Assist and Lane Departure Warning with lane return. The standout optional extra is the Driving Assistant Professional package comprising the Steering and Lane Control Assistant, Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function, automatic Speed Limit Assist, route speed control and traffic light recognition.\n\nPark Distance Control with sensors at both the front and rear is also part of standard specification. The Parking Assistant, likewise standard, enables automated manoeuvring into and out of parking spaces, as well as featuring a Reversing Assist Camera and the Reversing Assistant. There is also the option of the Parking Assistant Plus with Park View, Panorama View and Remote 3D View functions.\n\nThe M Performance models in the new BMW 4 Series range. Distinctive characters top the model range.\n\nThe new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible range is spearheaded by elite sporting models cast in the familiar M mould. The performance cars from BMW M GmbH showcase the dynamic potential woven into the vehicle concepts of the BMW 4 Series range to highly impressive effect. Extremely powerful six-cylinder in-line engines, a bespoke chassis set-up and signature M design cues both inside and out mark them out as a proposition apart.\n\nThe M Performance models in the BMW 4 Series are available with both petrol and diesel engines, each with a displacement of 3.0 litres. The M-typical performance attributes of these straight-six units are underpinned by, among other things, the latest M TwinPower Turbo technology – which is tailored individually to the engine at hand. Another shared feature is the 48V mild hybrid technology, whose output of 8 kW/11 hp produces an electric boost effect that gives the engines even sharper response.\n\nThe six-cylinder in-line petrol engine in the BMW M440i xDrive Coupé and BMW M440i xDrive Convertible generates maximum output of 275 kW/374 hp and peak torque of 500 Nm (369 lb-ft). The BMW M440d xDrive Coupé and BMW M440d xDrive Convertible, meanwhile, are powered by a straight-six diesel unit that produces maximum output of 250 kW/340 hp and peak torque of 700 Nm (516 lb-ft). M Sport suspension with variable sport steering can be found on the standard equipment list for the range-topping models, along with an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission with an ultra-sharp shift action, M Sport brakes and the M Sport differential.\n\nNew-look BMW kidney grille, black tailpipe finishers as standard.\n\nAn array of select design flourishes announces the dynamic character of the M Performance models even more vividly. For instance, the new edition of these models features a BMW kidney grille with a surround in Black high-gloss and horizontally arranged bars adorned by an M logo. All the front apron elements that were previously finished in Cerium Grey now come in Black high-gloss. As a result, the models’ appearance when viewed from the front recalls the design of the BMW M4 high-performance sports cars to an even greater extent.\n\nAt the rear end of the M Performance models, trapezoidal tailpipe trim signals the presence of the ultra-potent power unit under the bonnet. They are now in Black high-gloss as standard, meaning that all elements of the M High-gloss Shadowline trim option are already included in the standard specification of these models.\n\nExclusive touches: M exterior mirror caps, carbon fibre diffuser.\n\nAnother design element from the BMW M4 range has been incorporated into the flanks of the latest M Performance models from the BMW 4 Series, with M exterior mirrors in twin-stalk design included as a standard feature.\n\nThe optional M Carbon exterior package comprises exterior mirror caps and inserts for the outer air intakes made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The new BMW 4 Series Coupé also sports a carbon-fibre Gurney lip rear spoiler. This optional extra also adds a carbon-fibre diffuser in the lower section of the rear apron that is exclusive to the M Performance models.\n\nHeightened sports car ambience in the cabin.\n\nSport seats trimmed in the new M Performtex upholstery for Coupé models and Vernasca leather for the Convertible, interior trim elements in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite, M door sill trim, M pedals, an M driver’s footrest and M-specific graphics for the BMW Curved Display characterise the distinctive aura inside the M Performance models. M Sport seats trimmed in Vernasca leather can be specified as an option for the range-topping versions of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and are available in a choice of Black with blue contrast quilting or the new Black/Coral Red bi-colour finish.\n\nA new version of the M leather steering wheel turns up the sports car feel inside the flagship models another notch. Its flat-bottomed rim, red centre marker and contrast stitching in BMW M GmbH colours help to make the driving experience aboard the M Performance models in the new BMW 4 Series range even more engaging.\n\nDisplay and control/operation system, connectivity. The new BMW Operating System 8.5 and innovative digital services.\n\nThe advances made in terms of digitalisation in the latest edition of the BMW 4 Series are also clear to see. This is mainly thanks to the upgraded BMW iDrive display and control/operation system with QuickSelect based on BMW Operating System 8.5. In order to provide intuitive, easy control of numerous functions along with access to innovative digital services, the latest-generation BMW iDrive system fitted in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the new BMW 4 Series Convertible features a new-look home screen and QuickSelect rapid access tech, bringing an improved menu structure that takes its cue from consumer electronics devices.\n\nThe enhanced BMW iDrive featuring QuickSelect is packaged together with the BMW Curved Display and BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, meaning it has been carefully geared to operation using the touchscreen and natural language. The control/operation system in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible additionally comprises multifunction buttons on the steering wheel and, as an option, the BMW Head-Up Display. The new BMW iDrive helps to deliver a focused, assured driving experience by showing the right information in the right place.\n\nBMW iDrive with QuickSelect: functions shown on a single level and selectable with rapid-access tech.\n\nThe new BMW Operating System 8.5 home screen continuously displays the navigation system’s map view or other individually configurable graphics on the control display. On the same level, widgets appear in a vertical arrangement on the driver’s side of the display. Drivers can switch between them with a vertical swipe of the finger. The QuickSelect feature allows the function selected in this way to be activated directly without having to enter a submenu. And once the relevant settings have been chosen, a quick tap on the home icon at the lower edge of the control display is all it takes to return to the home screen. Icons for direct access to the climate control menu, All Apps menu and, if activated, Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ can also now be found next to the home icon.\n\nThe new flat menu structure makes it much easier to activate the desired functions and settings. The digital content – just like the hardware in the form of the BMW Curved Display – is designed to enhance the driver focus for which BMW is renowned.\n\nBMW Maps navigation system now with Augmented View.\n\nThe cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system forms part of the standard BMW Live Cockpit Plus. Following the introduction of BMW Operating System 8.5 in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, the system now makes it even easier to input destinations and can offer additional information while driving.\n\nAnother new feature is the Augmented View function which, like the BMW Head-Up Display, is available by specifying the optional BMW Live Cockpit Professional. This supplements the navigation system’s map display by showing a live video stream of the driver’s view on the control display or instrument cluster and augmenting it with tips and information to match the context. At confusing junctions, for instance, an animated directional arrow is integrated into the video image to help the driver take the best turn-off for the planned route. The Augmented View function can also come to the driver’s aid when searching for a parking spot by showing supplementary information.\n\nPersonalisation using the BMW ID and My BMW App.\n\nDrivers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible will also find it easier to use their BMW ID to personalise the user experience. In future, signing in to the vehicle by using a smartphone to scan a QR code is all it will take to import the customer’s personal profile, load synchronisable settings and automatically link the key detected in the vehicle with the BMW ID.\n\nThe vehicle is also added to the My BMW App without the customer having to do anything. Available free of charge from the app stores for both iOS and Android, the My BMW App acts as a universal digital interface that provides information at any time on the vehicle’s status, for example, its remaining range and any servicing and maintenance requirements. Depending on the car’s specification, it also enables remote operation of functions such as locating the vehicle, locking and unlocking the doors or monitoring the car’s immediate vicinity and interior with Remote View. The My BMW app can additionally be used to send destination addresses from a smartphone to the vehicle’s navigation system. The My Trips feature including Efficiency Trainer and monthly review provides the user with data and evaluations for distances travelled, fuel consumption and average speed.\n\nOptimum connectivity with Personal eSIM and 5G mobile standard.\n\nCustomers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the news BMW 4 Series Convertible can activate the Personal eSIM as standard, in addition to the vehicle’s built-in mobile SIM. This enables the vehicle to use the 5G mobile communications standard. The Personal eSIM allows the customer to use the communications and connectivity functions covered by their mobile contract from their car with ease – even in situations where they don’t have their smartphone with them. This also includes data streaming via the WiFi hotspot.\n\nA low-radiation connection to the vehicle’s exterior antenna is used for making phone calls and streaming data via the Personal eSIM. All phone functions can be operated with the BMW iDrive system or the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The Personal eSIM can be used in all countries where BMW Connected Drive services are available. It extends the customer’s existing mobile phone contract, which may result in additional costs.\n\nParking fees and fuel bills can be paid directly from the vehicle.\n\nIn many European countries, the BMW ID allows drivers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and BMW 4 Series Convertible to pay parking fees directly from their vehicle. The vehicle automatically detects whether the service is available upon arrival in a parking zone and displays the payment function if the zone is covered by one of the linked providers. The parking booking can be paid quickly and simply using the credit card registered in the My BMW App. The booking ends automatically when the vehicle exits the parking space again.\n\nAnd drivers in Germany also have the option of settling fuel bills digitally from their car as soon as they have refuelled at participating filling stations. As with the parking fee payment service, this is done using the credit card information first registered in the vehicle apps.\n\nBMW M Performance Parts.Fuelled by proven expertise in the world of motor sport.\n\nMore than ever, the inimitable combination of driving pleasure and elegantly sporty design presented by the new BMW 4 Series models sets them apart from the crowd in the premium segment of the midsize class. The vehicle concept underpinning the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible offers extraordinary potential for delivering superior driving characteristics. And now the latest upgrades for the exterior and interior are available to showcase their dynamic character with even greater intensity.

These have been hallmark brand values of BMW since its earliest days, and the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible embody them even more intently than ever.Sporting elegance to the power of 4. The epitome of driving pleasure in the premium midsize class.\n\nWhen it comes to the premium segment of the midsize class, the number 4 stands for the perfect combination of driving pleasure and elegantly sporty design. These have been hallmark brand values of BMW since its earliest days, and the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible embody them even more intently than ever. The precisely modified exterior design of the two models underscores their dynamic character and exclusive style. Modern touches and new equipment features bring a premium ambience of renewed sophistication to the interior. Here, the cutting-edge cockpit design, including the BMW Curved Display, provides the ideal stage for the latest evolution of BMW iDrive with QuickSelect, which is based on the new BMW Operating System 8.5.\n\nNew exterior paint finishes and light-alloy wheels, headlights with an extremely striking design for the light sources and the now optionally available Laserlight rear lights mark out the latest advances in the exterior of the two models. Step inside the sporting two-door models and the key new features of the cabin are immediately apparent: the revised design of the steering wheels and instrument panel, the seat coverings, the interior trim elements and the now optionally available CraftedClarity glass applications for selected controls. Alongside the introduction of the new BMW iDrive with QuickSelect as standard, customers can now also choose to add an Augmented View display for the BMW Maps navigation system as an option on their new BMW 4 Series.\n\nProduction of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible will remain at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, which is also the birthplace of many other executive class and luxury segment cars from the brand, as well as the BMW 8 Series sports car and the high-performance BMW M4 models. Its worldwide market launch will get underway in March 2024.\n\nGlobal segment leaders sharpen the sporting profile of the BMW brand.\n\nThe evolution of the BMW 4 Series range is anchored in the product substance that has helped it achieve such outstanding popularity across all the major car markets. In a market dominated by German premium carmakers, the coupé and convertible enjoy clear leads in their respective segments both globally and in their key individual markets.\n\nThe most important sales markets for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are the USA, Germany and China. Since the market launch of the current model generation of the BMW 4 Series Coupé, the US market has recorded the strongest demand. The BMW 4 Series Convertible has also been most popular in the USA to date.\n\nThis sales success has been accompanied by an extraordinarily high level of customer satisfaction. In customer surveys, both the BMW 4 Series Coupé and BMW 4 Series Convertible achieve excellent approval ratings. Customers placed particular emphasis on the dynamic driving characteristics and emotionally rich design of both models, as well as a premium feel characterised by high material and build quality. By attracting such positive responses from customers, the BMW 4 Series models have made a significant contribution to further enhancing the brand’s profile as a maker of dynamically exceptional and elegantly sporty premium cars.\n\nDistinct characters with a shared focus on driving pleasure.\n\nFor the past two model generations, BMW has grouped its premium midsize coupés and convertibles into their own model range. This has highlighted their particularly intense focus on delivering the driving pleasure for which the brand is renowned. The differentiation between the new BMW 4 Series models and the BMW 3 Series in terms of design can be found not only in their proportions and lines, but also their distinctive front-end visuals. Wider tracks and specific tuning for their chassis technology lay the groundwork for superlative dynamic prowess. Within the BMW 4 Series range, the coupé and convertible models represent distinct characters whose individual vehicle concepts target different priorities.\n\nThe BMW 4 Series Coupé combines its dynamically flowing lines and elegantly stretched proportions with a body optimised for extra handling agility and boasting exceptional torsional rigidity, plus a chassis tuned squarely for dynamic excellence. The individual-seat character of the two rear seats helps to ensure that the passengers in the second row also enjoy an intense driving experience. The folding function of the three-section split rear seat bench increases the versatility of the interior when it comes to accommodating items for leisure activities and longer trips away.\n\nMeanwhile, passengers in the BMW 4 Series Convertible’s four seats can sample the sporty driving experience characteristic of the 4 Series together with the joy of open-top motoring. A particularly stylish sense of elegance, for which the car’s low-slung silhouette is principally responsible, also comes as standard. A highlight feature specific to the BMW 4 Series Convertible is its panel bow soft-top roof, which combines the solidity of a retractable hardtop with the classical aesthetic of a fabric hood. The roof’s electric drive mechanism can be activated while travelling at up to 50 km/h (31 mph); the opening/closing process takes 18 seconds.\n\nTaking steps to further reduce the company’s carbon footprint.\n\nHighly efficient engines, intelligent lightweight design and optimised aerodynamic attributes make a significant contribution to enhancing driving pleasure in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, at the same time as lowering fuel consumption and emissions. Meanwhile, the 48V mild hybrid technology deployed on certain models sharpens power delivery and improves efficiency. As well as the bonnet, front side panels and doors, numerous chassis components are also made from aluminium. And with a Cd as low as 0.25 in the case of the coupé and as low as 0.27 for the convertible, the two models can claim an impressive drag coefficient.\n\nIn the interests of creating an even more sustainable overall concept, growing importance is attached to the use of secondary raw materials –alongside further optimised use of materials and energy-optimised production methods. For the BMW brand, the twin goals of increasing sustainability and achieving premium standards are inextricably linked, rather than competing factors.\n\nExterior design. Striking visual cues point the way to captivating dynamics.\n\nSporting potency and elegance are the key themes reflected with authenticity in the design of the BMW 4 Series models. Precise modifications to their exterior visuals enable the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible to express their unique characters even more clearly. The new features sharpen the profile of the two models and provide eye-catching pointers to their captivating dynamics, exclusivity and technological advances.\n\nWith their distinctive lines and clean surface treatment in the brand’s modern design language, the coupé and convertible members of the BMW 4 Series line-up exude driving pleasure and inimitable style. The features of the optional M Sport package add further punch to the cars’ dynamic appearance. They include a diffuser element in the lower section of the rear bumper, which is now painted in Black high-gloss. In addition, the exhaust tailpipes integrated into the rear apron on the left and right have grown from 90 millimetres to 100 millimetres in diameter. As an extension to the M Sport package, customers can also order their cars with the M Sport package Pro and M Carbon exterior package.\n\nNewly designed headlights, innovative Laserlight rear lights.\n\nDesign cues specific to the BMW 4 Series include the visually powerful front end shaped by slim LED headlights and a vertically arranged BMW kidney grille. The air intakes of the strikingly forward-angled grille have a mesh structure, both in standard form and if the M Sport package is specified. Their surround now comes in matt chrome.\n\nThe new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible also feature visually and functionally upgraded headlights. The LED units in their inner workings, which provide all the light functions, have been redesigned and have a new structure. Low and high beam are generated from a single LED module. And a pair of vertical and subtly arrow-shaped LED units house the side light, daytime driving light and turn signal indicator functions. The technically focused look of the new light sources gives the headlights a high-quality and progressive appearance.\n\nAdaptive LED Headlights with non-dazzling matrix high beam are available as an option. They can be identified by blue inlays and include urban lights and a cornering light function. The prism structure of the LED units for the urban lights provides a striking contrast against the uniform illumination of the daytime driving light units.\n\nAlso offered as part of the M Sport package Pro and if the Adaptive LED Headlights are specified are M Shadowline lights with dark inner accents. If the optional Comfort Access is fitted, the headlights generate a Welcome Light Animation once the driver and vehicle key come within three metres of the car.\n\nExamples of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible specified with Adaptive LED Headlights are also fitted with super-expressive Laserlight rear lights. This model-specific version of an innovative lighting effect employs a technology first seen in the BMW M4 CSL high-performance special edition produced in a limited run of 1,000 examples. Here, laser diodes each illuminate a fibre optic bundle, giving the rear units an intricate light graphic. The precise lines of the three-dimensional Laserlight gives these rear lights – which are making their debut in a volume-produced car – an exclusive and unmistakable design.\n\nNew exterior paint shades and light-alloy wheels.\n\nCustomers can give the outside of their new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible a personal touch with a choice of two solid and eight metallic paint finishes. Cape York Green metallic and Fire Red metallic are new additions to the range. And a wide variety of BMW Individual paint finishes and BMW Individual special paint finishes are also offered.\n\nAttractive new additions can also be found in the selection of optional light-alloy wheels. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are both offered for the first time with three new 19-inch variants. The new M light-alloy wheels in double-spoke design can be ordered in either Jet Black or a bi-colour finish. And the new BMW Individual light-alloy wheels also have a Y-spoke design and are finished in Midnight Grey.\n\nInterior and equipment. Progressive style and an aura of carefully honed refinement.\n\nStandard-fitted sport seats and newly designed steering wheels feed into the intensity of the driving experience in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible. The large BMW Curved Display brings a fresh and particularly modern interpretation of the driver focus for which the brand is renowned. High-quality, meticulously crafted materials and a new operating concept for ventilation and climate control systems add to the cockpit’s premium allure. The modifications carried out to the interior of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible ensure those on board can enjoy driving pleasure with progressive style and long-distance comfort in an ambience of carefully honed refinement.\n\nAmong the cutting-edge new features is a version of the optionally available seat surfaces that is making its debut in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and is produced using more sustainable methods. Added to which, new interior trim strips are available for both the coupé and convertible. And standard specification now also includes ambient lighting and electrically folding exterior mirrors. The range of optional equipment has been restructured to enable particularly targeted individualisation.\n\nNew steering wheels with standard gearshift paddles.\n\nThe latest-generation steering wheels available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible stand out with their modern and sporty design. As standard, the driver will find in front of them a newly designed sports leather steering wheel with a polygonal rim and two spokes. The M Sport package now brings an M leather steering wheel in three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim and a discreet centre marking.\n\nBoth versions of the newly designed steering wheels have illuminated multifunction buttons and gearshift paddles. Now fitted as standard, the paddles enable particularly swift manual interventions in the gear selection process and underscore the sharper sporting profile of the new BMW 4 Series models.\n\nDetail revisions for the instrument panel, digital climate control.\n\nThe introduction of the upgraded BMW iDrive with QuickSelect also brings improved operation of the ventilation and climate control functions in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and in the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. This is a prime example of advanced digitalisation at work and enables a further reduction in the number of physical buttons and controls in the cockpit. Temperature selection, intensity of ventilation and – if the relevant features are specified – seat and steering wheel heating can now be adjusted by touch via the BMW Curved Display or by voice command with the help of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. New adjustment controls for the air vent grilles in the centre of the instrument panel and on the driver’s and front passenger side of the cockpit allow the direction of airflow to be adjusted using rotating and tilting movements. Specifying optional Sensatec trim for the instrument panel means customers will now find a further refined surface structure which further highlights the interior’s modern premium ambience.\n\nThe standard ambient lighting in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible now also includes contour lighting integrated into the trim around the central seam vents. Like the lighting for the footwells, the storage compartment in the front section of the centre console and the door openers, this can be adjusted for colour and brightness according to personal preference. Users can choose from nine colours. The functionality of the interior lighting also includes an atmospheric Welcome and Goodbye Animation and light signals indicating an open door or incoming phone call.\n\nPremiere for M Performtex seat covers in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé.\n\nThe standard-fit sport seats combine with interior surfaces in Sensatec perforated. The Vernasca leather trim with decorative quilting available as an option for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and for the new BMW 4 Series Convertible is now also offered in the new bi-colour variant Black/Red. And both models can also be specified with BMW Individual Merino leather trim in three colours.\n\nWhen ordered with the M Sport package or in M Performance form, the new BMW 4 Series Coupé comes with seat surfaces in black M Performtex. Making its debut in a BMW model, this velours covering combines high material quality and a sporty design with low weight and a sustainability-optimised production method.\n\nNew interior trim strips, exclusive touches with CraftedClarity.\n\nThe selection of available interior trim strips has also been extensively revised, with Dark Graphite matt now standard specification for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible. The M Sport package includes interior trim strips in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite. Also on the options list are Fineline Light open-pored and Grey Blue Ash open-pored fine-wood trim, and M interior trim carbon fibre.\n\nThe use of extremely high-quality materials also allows distinctive touches to be included in other areas of the interior to enhance its modern premium character. Electroplated applications for the control panel in the doors, which includes the window controls and locking switch, are available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. And customers can also specify CraftedClarity glass applications – another new addition to the options list. These give the gear selector lever, BMW iDrive Controller and Start/Stop button a particular air of exclusivity, both visually and in how they feel to the touch.\n\nPowertrain and driving experience.Powerful, efficient and supremely assured.\n\nThe line-up of powertrains for the new BMW 4 Series range comprises powerful and highly efficient petrol and diesel engines featuring BMW TwinPower Turbo technology and electrification in the form of 48V mild hybrid technology. All the drive units deliver an exceptional blend of sporting driving pleasure and fuel economy, all are part of the current modular generation of Efficient Dynamics engines and all are mated to an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission as standard. The shift paddles on the steering wheel, which also come as standard in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, allow quick manual interventions in the gear selection process, adding to the dynamic driving experience.\n\nStraight-six engines can be found under the bonnet of the M Performance versions in both model series (see separate chapter), as well as in the new BMW 430d xDrive Coupé and BMW 430d Convertible, whose diesel unit has an output of 210 kW/286 hp. The line-up also includes two four-cylinder petrol engines developing 135 kW/184 hp and 180 kW/245 hp respectively and a 140 kW/190 hp four-cylinder diesel. The engine’s power is fed to the road via either classical rear-wheel drive or the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system, depending on the model variant.\n\nMild hybrid technology optimises power delivery and efficiency.\n\nAll the six-cylinder in-line engines available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, as well as the four-cylinder diesel unit, come with 48V mild hybrid technology for sharper power delivery and greater efficiency. The auxiliary electric drive takes the form of a 48V starter generator and makes output of 8 kW/11 hp instantly available in response to the slightest movement of the accelerator. This electric boost enhances the drive system’s dynamic response when accelerating off the line and putting in mid-range bursts of speed. The electric drive unit also assists the engine when travelling at a constant speed, allowing it to operate within an efficiency-optimised load range as often as possible.\n\nThe mild hybrid system additionally allows the use of electric power recuperated via Brake Energy Regeneration and stored in a 48V battery. The energy harvested efficiently in this way is not only used for the auxiliary electric drive, but also fed to the 12V electrical system with the help of a voltage transformer. This allows the vehicle’s electrical consumers to be operated even more efficiently.\n\nBespoke chassis technology for a sporty driving experience.\n\nExcellent body rigidity, intelligent lightweight design, 50 : 50 weight distribution and optimised aerodynamic properties provide an ideal basis for endowing the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible with remarkably agile and dynamic handling abilities. This is further helped by sophisticated chassis technology that has been tuned precisely for the weight spread at hand.\n\nLift-related dampers refine the balance between captivating sporting prowess and superb long-distance comfort. Various options are available for customising the car’s character, including M Sport suspension, adaptive M suspension with variable sport steering, and M Sport brakes.\n\nWide variety of systems for automated driving and parking.\n\nThe range of systems for automated driving and parking is just as extensive. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are fitted as standard with the front collision warning system with brake intervention, Cruise Control with brake function, Speed Limit Info with no-overtaking indicator, manual Speed Limit Assist and Lane Departure Warning with lane return.

There is also the option of the Parking Assistant Plus with Park View, Panorama View and Remote 3D View functions.\n\nThe M Performance models in the new BMW 4 Series range. Distinctive characters top the model range.\n\nThe new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible range is spearheaded by elite sporting models cast in the familiar M mould. The performance cars from BMW M GmbH showcase the dynamic potential woven into the vehicle concepts of the BMW 4 Series range to highly impressive effect. Extremely powerful six-cylinder in-line engines, a bespoke chassis set-up and signature M design cues both inside and out mark them out as a proposition apart.\n\nThe M Performance models in the BMW 4 Series are available with both petrol and diesel engines, each with a displacement of 3.0 litres. The M-typical performance attributes of these straight-six units are underpinned by, among other things, the latest M TwinPower Turbo technology – which is tailored individually to the engine at hand. Another shared feature is the 48V mild hybrid technology, whose output of 8 kW/11 hp produces an electric boost effect that gives the engines even sharper response.\n\nThe six-cylinder in-line petrol engine in the BMW M440i xDrive Coupé and BMW M440i xDrive Convertible generates maximum output of 275 kW/374 hp and peak torque of 500 Nm (369 lb-ft). The BMW M440d xDrive Coupé and BMW M440d xDrive Convertible, meanwhile, are powered by a straight-six diesel unit that produces maximum output of 250 kW/340 hp and peak torque of 700 Nm (516 lb-ft). M Sport suspension with variable sport steering can be found on the standard equipment list for the range-topping models, along with an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission with an ultra-sharp shift action, M Sport brakes and the M Sport differential.\n\nNew-look BMW kidney grille, black tailpipe finishers as standard.\n\nAn array of select design flourishes announces the dynamic character of the M Performance models even more vividly. For instance, the new edition of these models features a BMW kidney grille with a surround in Black high-gloss and horizontally arranged bars adorned by an M logo. All the front apron elements that were previously finished in Cerium Grey now come in Black high-gloss. As a result, the models’ appearance when viewed from the front recalls the design of the BMW M4 high-performance sports cars to an even greater extent.\n\nAt the rear end of the M Performance models, trapezoidal tailpipe trim signals the presence of the ultra-potent power unit under the bonnet. They are now in Black high-gloss as standard, meaning that all elements of the M High-gloss Shadowline trim option are already included in the standard specification of these models.\n\nExclusive touches: M exterior mirror caps, carbon fibre diffuser.\n\nAnother design element from the BMW M4 range has been incorporated into the flanks of the latest M Performance models from the BMW 4 Series, with M exterior mirrors in twin-stalk design included as a standard feature.\n\nThe optional M Carbon exterior package comprises exterior mirror caps and inserts for the outer air intakes made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The new BMW 4 Series Coupé also sports a carbon-fibre Gurney lip rear spoiler. This optional extra also adds a carbon-fibre diffuser in the lower section of the rear apron that is exclusive to the M Performance models.\n\nHeightened sports car ambience in the cabin.\n\nSport seats trimmed in the new M Performtex upholstery for Coupé models and Vernasca leather for the Convertible, interior trim elements in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite, M door sill trim, M pedals, an M driver’s footrest and M-specific graphics for the BMW Curved Display characterise the distinctive aura inside the M Performance models. M Sport seats trimmed in Vernasca leather can be specified as an option for the range-topping versions of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and are available in a choice of Black with blue contrast quilting or the new Black/Coral Red bi-colour finish.\n\nA new version of the M leather steering wheel turns up the sports car feel inside the flagship models another notch. Its flat-bottomed rim, red centre marker and contrast stitching in BMW M GmbH colours help to make the driving experience aboard the M Performance models in the new BMW 4 Series range even more engaging.\n\nDisplay and control/operation system, connectivity. The new BMW Operating System 8.5 and innovative digital services.\n\nThe advances made in terms of digitalisation in the latest edition of the BMW 4 Series are also clear to see. This is mainly thanks to the upgraded BMW iDrive display and control/operation system with QuickSelect based on BMW Operating System 8.5. In order to provide intuitive, easy control of numerous functions along with access to innovative digital services, the latest-generation BMW iDrive system fitted in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the new BMW 4 Series Convertible features a new-look home screen and QuickSelect rapid access tech, bringing an improved menu structure that takes its cue from consumer electronics devices.\n\nThe enhanced BMW iDrive featuring QuickSelect is packaged together with the BMW Curved Display and BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, meaning it has been carefully geared to operation using the touchscreen and natural language.

The new BMW iDrive helps to deliver a focused, assured driving experience by showing the right information in the right place.\n\nBMW iDrive with QuickSelect: functions shown on a single level and selectable with rapid-access tech.\n\nThe new BMW Operating System 8.5 home screen continuously displays the navigation system’s map view or other individually configurable graphics on the control display. On the same level, widgets appear in a vertical arrangement on the driver’s side of the display. Drivers can switch between them with a vertical swipe of the finger. The QuickSelect feature allows the function selected in this way to be activated directly without having to enter a submenu. And once the relevant settings have been chosen, a quick tap on the home icon at the lower edge of the control display is all it takes to return to the home screen. Icons for direct access to the climate control menu, All Apps menu and, if activated, Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ can also now be found next to the home icon.\n\nThe new flat menu structure makes it much easier to activate the desired functions and settings. The digital content – just like the hardware in the form of the BMW Curved Display – is designed to enhance the driver focus for which BMW is renowned.\n\nBMW Maps navigation system now with Augmented View.\n\nThe cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system forms part of the standard BMW Live Cockpit Plus. Following the introduction of BMW Operating System 8.5 in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, the system now makes it even easier to input destinations and can offer additional information while driving.\n\nAnother new feature is the Augmented View function which, like the BMW Head-Up Display, is available by specifying the optional BMW Live Cockpit Professional. This supplements the navigation system’s map display by showing a live video stream of the driver’s view on the control display or instrument cluster and augmenting it with tips and information to match the context. At confusing junctions, for instance, an animated directional arrow is integrated into the video image to help the driver take the best turn-off for the planned route. The Augmented View function can also come to the driver’s aid when searching for a parking spot by showing supplementary information.\n\nPersonalisation using the BMW ID and My BMW App.\n\nDrivers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible will also find it easier to use their BMW ID to personalise the user experience. In future, signing in to the vehicle by using a smartphone to scan a QR code is all it will take to import the customer’s personal profile, load synchronisable settings and automatically link the key detected in the vehicle with the BMW ID.\n\nThe vehicle is also added to the My BMW App without the customer having to do anything. Available free of charge from the app stores for both iOS and Android, the My BMW App acts as a universal digital interface that provides information at any time on the vehicle’s status, for example, its remaining range and any servicing and maintenance requirements. Depending on the car’s specification, it also enables remote operation of functions such as locating the vehicle, locking and unlocking the doors or monitoring the car’s immediate vicinity and interior with Remote View. The My BMW app can additionally be used to send destination addresses from a smartphone to the vehicle’s navigation system. The My Trips feature including Efficiency Trainer and monthly review provides the user with data and evaluations for distances travelled, fuel consumption and average speed.\n\nOptimum connectivity with Personal eSIM and 5G mobile standard.\n\nCustomers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the news BMW 4 Series Convertible can activate the Personal eSIM as standard, in addition to the vehicle’s built-in mobile SIM. This enables the vehicle to use the 5G mobile communications standard. The Personal eSIM allows the customer to use the communications and connectivity functions covered by their mobile contract from their car with ease – even in situations where they don’t have their smartphone with them. This also includes data streaming via the WiFi hotspot.\n\nA low-radiation connection to the vehicle’s exterior antenna is used for making phone calls and streaming data via the Personal eSIM. All phone functions can be operated with the BMW iDrive system or the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The Personal eSIM can be used in all countries where BMW Connected Drive services are available. It extends the customer’s existing mobile phone contract, which may result in additional costs.\n\nParking fees and fuel bills can be paid directly from the vehicle.\n\nIn many European countries, the BMW ID allows drivers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and BMW 4 Series Convertible to pay parking fees directly from their vehicle. The vehicle automatically detects whether the service is available upon arrival in a parking zone and displays the payment function if the zone is covered by one of the linked providers. The parking booking can be paid quickly and simply using the credit card registered in the My BMW App. The booking ends automatically when the vehicle exits the parking space again.\n\nAnd drivers in Germany also have the option of settling fuel bills digitally from their car as soon as they have refuelled at participating filling stations. As with the parking fee payment service, this is done using the credit card information first registered in the vehicle apps.\n\nBMW M Performance Parts.Fuelled by proven expertise in the world of motor sport.\n\nMore than ever, the inimitable combination of driving pleasure and elegantly sporty design presented by the new BMW 4 Series models sets them apart from the crowd in the premium segment of the midsize class.

The epitome of driving pleasure in the premium midsize class.\n\nWhen it comes to the premium segment of the midsize class, the number 4 stands for the perfect combination of driving pleasure and elegantly sporty design. These have been hallmark brand values of BMW since its earliest days, and the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible embody them even more intently than ever. The precisely modified exterior design of the two models underscores their dynamic character and exclusive style. Modern touches and new equipment features bring a premium ambience of renewed sophistication to the interior. Here, the cutting-edge cockpit design, including the BMW Curved Display, provides the ideal stage for the latest evolution of BMW iDrive with QuickSelect, which is based on the new BMW Operating System 8.5.\n\nNew exterior paint finishes and light-alloy wheels, headlights with an extremely striking design for the light sources and the now optionally available Laserlight rear lights mark out the latest advances in the exterior of the two models. Step inside the sporting two-door models and the key new features of the cabin are immediately apparent: the revised design of the steering wheels and instrument panel, the seat coverings, the interior trim elements and the now optionally available CraftedClarity glass applications for selected controls. Alongside the introduction of the new BMW iDrive with QuickSelect as standard, customers can now also choose to add an Augmented View display for the BMW Maps navigation system as an option on their new BMW 4 Series.\n\nProduction of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible will remain at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, which is also the birthplace of many other executive class and luxury segment cars from the brand, as well as the BMW 8 Series sports car and the high-performance BMW M4 models. Its worldwide market launch will get underway in March 2024.\n\nGlobal segment leaders sharpen the sporting profile of the BMW brand.\n\nThe evolution of the BMW 4 Series range is anchored in the product substance that has helped it achieve such outstanding popularity across all the major car markets. In a market dominated by German premium carmakers, the coupé and convertible enjoy clear leads in their respective segments both globally and in their key individual markets.\n\nThe most important sales markets for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are the USA, Germany and China. Since the market launch of the current model generation of the BMW 4 Series Coupé, the US market has recorded the strongest demand. The BMW 4 Series Convertible has also been most popular in the USA to date.\n\nThis sales success has been accompanied by an extraordinarily high level of customer satisfaction. In customer surveys, both the BMW 4 Series Coupé and BMW 4 Series Convertible achieve excellent approval ratings. Customers placed particular emphasis on the dynamic driving characteristics and emotionally rich design of both models, as well as a premium feel characterised by high material and build quality. By attracting such positive responses from customers, the BMW 4 Series models have made a significant contribution to further enhancing the brand’s profile as a maker of dynamically exceptional and elegantly sporty premium cars.\n\nDistinct characters with a shared focus on driving pleasure.\n\nFor the past two model generations, BMW has grouped its premium midsize coupés and convertibles into their own model range. This has highlighted their particularly intense focus on delivering the driving pleasure for which the brand is renowned. The differentiation between the new BMW 4 Series models and the BMW 3 Series in terms of design can be found not only in their proportions and lines, but also their distinctive front-end visuals. Wider tracks and specific tuning for their chassis technology lay the groundwork for superlative dynamic prowess. Within the BMW 4 Series range, the coupé and convertible models represent distinct characters whose individual vehicle concepts target different priorities.\n\nThe BMW 4 Series Coupé combines its dynamically flowing lines and elegantly stretched proportions with a body optimised for extra handling agility and boasting exceptional torsional rigidity, plus a chassis tuned squarely for dynamic excellence. The individual-seat character of the two rear seats helps to ensure that the passengers in the second row also enjoy an intense driving experience. The folding function of the three-section split rear seat bench increases the versatility of the interior when it comes to accommodating items for leisure activities and longer trips away.\n\nMeanwhile, passengers in the BMW 4 Series Convertible’s four seats can sample the sporty driving experience characteristic of the 4 Series together with the joy of open-top motoring. A particularly stylish sense of elegance, for which the car’s low-slung silhouette is principally responsible, also comes as standard. A highlight feature specific to the BMW 4 Series Convertible is its panel bow soft-top roof, which combines the solidity of a retractable hardtop with the classical aesthetic of a fabric hood. The roof’s electric drive mechanism can be activated while travelling at up to 50 km/h (31 mph); the opening/closing process takes 18 seconds.\n\nTaking steps to further reduce the company’s carbon footprint.\n\nHighly efficient engines, intelligent lightweight design and optimised aerodynamic attributes make a significant contribution to enhancing driving pleasure in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, at the same time as lowering fuel consumption and emissions. Meanwhile, the 48V mild hybrid technology deployed on certain models sharpens power delivery and improves efficiency. As well as the bonnet, front side panels and doors, numerous chassis components are also made from aluminium. And with a Cd as low as 0.25 in the case of the coupé and as low as 0.27 for the convertible, the two models can claim an impressive drag coefficient.\n\nIn the interests of creating an even more sustainable overall concept, growing importance is attached to the use of secondary raw materials –alongside further optimised use of materials and energy-optimised production methods. For the BMW brand, the twin goals of increasing sustainability and achieving premium standards are inextricably linked, rather than competing factors.\n\nExterior design. Striking visual cues point the way to captivating dynamics.\n\nSporting potency and elegance are the key themes reflected with authenticity in the design of the BMW 4 Series models. Precise modifications to their exterior visuals enable the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible to express their unique characters even more clearly. The new features sharpen the profile of the two models and provide eye-catching pointers to their captivating dynamics, exclusivity and technological advances.\n\nWith their distinctive lines and clean surface treatment in the brand’s modern design language, the coupé and convertible members of the BMW 4 Series line-up exude driving pleasure and inimitable style. The features of the optional M Sport package add further punch to the cars’ dynamic appearance. They include a diffuser element in the lower section of the rear bumper, which is now painted in Black high-gloss. In addition, the exhaust tailpipes integrated into the rear apron on the left and right have grown from 90 millimetres to 100 millimetres in diameter. As an extension to the M Sport package, customers can also order their cars with the M Sport package Pro and M Carbon exterior package.\n\nNewly designed headlights, innovative Laserlight rear lights.\n\nDesign cues specific to the BMW 4 Series include the visually powerful front end shaped by slim LED headlights and a vertically arranged BMW kidney grille. The air intakes of the strikingly forward-angled grille have a mesh structure, both in standard form and if the M Sport package is specified. Their surround now comes in matt chrome.\n\nThe new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible also feature visually and functionally upgraded headlights. The LED units in their inner workings, which provide all the light functions, have been redesigned and have a new structure. Low and high beam are generated from a single LED module. And a pair of vertical and subtly arrow-shaped LED units house the side light, daytime driving light and turn signal indicator functions. The technically focused look of the new light sources gives the headlights a high-quality and progressive appearance.\n\nAdaptive LED Headlights with non-dazzling matrix high beam are available as an option. They can be identified by blue inlays and include urban lights and a cornering light function. The prism structure of the LED units for the urban lights provides a striking contrast against the uniform illumination of the daytime driving light units.\n\nAlso offered as part of the M Sport package Pro and if the Adaptive LED Headlights are specified are M Shadowline lights with dark inner accents. If the optional Comfort Access is fitted, the headlights generate a Welcome Light Animation once the driver and vehicle key come within three metres of the car.\n\nExamples of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible specified with Adaptive LED Headlights are also fitted with super-expressive Laserlight rear lights. This model-specific version of an innovative lighting effect employs a technology first seen in the BMW M4 CSL high-performance special edition produced in a limited run of 1,000 examples. Here, laser diodes each illuminate a fibre optic bundle, giving the rear units an intricate light graphic. The precise lines of the three-dimensional Laserlight gives these rear lights – which are making their debut in a volume-produced car – an exclusive and unmistakable design.\n\nNew exterior paint shades and light-alloy wheels.\n\nCustomers can give the outside of their new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible a personal touch with a choice of two solid and eight metallic paint finishes. Cape York Green metallic and Fire Red metallic are new additions to the range. And a wide variety of BMW Individual paint finishes and BMW Individual special paint finishes are also offered.\n\nAttractive new additions can also be found in the selection of optional light-alloy wheels. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are both offered for the first time with three new 19-inch variants. The new M light-alloy wheels in double-spoke design can be ordered in either Jet Black or a bi-colour finish. And the new BMW Individual light-alloy wheels also have a Y-spoke design and are finished in Midnight Grey.\n\nInterior and equipment. Progressive style and an aura of carefully honed refinement.\n\nStandard-fitted sport seats and newly designed steering wheels feed into the intensity of the driving experience in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible. The large BMW Curved Display brings a fresh and particularly modern interpretation of the driver focus for which the brand is renowned. High-quality, meticulously crafted materials and a new operating concept for ventilation and climate control systems add to the cockpit’s premium allure. The modifications carried out to the interior of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible ensure those on board can enjoy driving pleasure with progressive style and long-distance comfort in an ambience of carefully honed refinement.\n\nAmong the cutting-edge new features is a version of the optionally available seat surfaces that is making its debut in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and is produced using more sustainable methods. Added to which, new interior trim strips are available for both the coupé and convertible. And standard specification now also includes ambient lighting and electrically folding exterior mirrors. The range of optional equipment has been restructured to enable particularly targeted individualisation.\n\nNew steering wheels with standard gearshift paddles.\n\nThe latest-generation steering wheels available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible stand out with their modern and sporty design. As standard, the driver will find in front of them a newly designed sports leather steering wheel with a polygonal rim and two spokes. The M Sport package now brings an M leather steering wheel in three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim and a discreet centre marking.\n\nBoth versions of the newly designed steering wheels have illuminated multifunction buttons and gearshift paddles. Now fitted as standard, the paddles enable particularly swift manual interventions in the gear selection process and underscore the sharper sporting profile of the new BMW 4 Series models.\n\nDetail revisions for the instrument panel, digital climate control.\n\nThe introduction of the upgraded BMW iDrive with QuickSelect also brings improved operation of the ventilation and climate control functions in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and in the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. This is a prime example of advanced digitalisation at work and enables a further reduction in the number of physical buttons and controls in the cockpit. Temperature selection, intensity of ventilation and – if the relevant features are specified – seat and steering wheel heating can now be adjusted by touch via the BMW Curved Display or by voice command with the help of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. New adjustment controls for the air vent grilles in the centre of the instrument panel and on the driver’s and front passenger side of the cockpit allow the direction of airflow to be adjusted using rotating and tilting movements. Specifying optional Sensatec trim for the instrument panel means customers will now find a further refined surface structure which further highlights the interior’s modern premium ambience.\n\nThe standard ambient lighting in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible now also includes contour lighting integrated into the trim around the central seam vents. Like the lighting for the footwells, the storage compartment in the front section of the centre console and the door openers, this can be adjusted for colour and brightness according to personal preference. Users can choose from nine colours. The functionality of the interior lighting also includes an atmospheric Welcome and Goodbye Animation and light signals indicating an open door or incoming phone call.\n\nPremiere for M Performtex seat covers in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé.\n\nThe standard-fit sport seats combine with interior surfaces in Sensatec perforated. The Vernasca leather trim with decorative quilting available as an option for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and for the new BMW 4 Series Convertible is now also offered in the new bi-colour variant Black/Red. And both models can also be specified with BMW Individual Merino leather trim in three colours.\n\nWhen ordered with the M Sport package or in M Performance form, the new BMW 4 Series Coupé comes with seat surfaces in black M Performtex. Making its debut in a BMW model, this velours covering combines high material quality and a sporty design with low weight and a sustainability-optimised production method.\n\nNew interior trim strips, exclusive touches with CraftedClarity.\n\nThe selection of available interior trim strips has also been extensively revised, with Dark Graphite matt now standard specification for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible. The M Sport package includes interior trim strips in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite. Also on the options list are Fineline Light open-pored and Grey Blue Ash open-pored fine-wood trim, and M interior trim carbon fibre.\n\nThe use of extremely high-quality materials also allows distinctive touches to be included in other areas of the interior to enhance its modern premium character. Electroplated applications for the control panel in the doors, which includes the window controls and locking switch, are available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. And customers can also specify CraftedClarity glass applications – another new addition to the options list. These give the gear selector lever, BMW iDrive Controller and Start/Stop button a particular air of exclusivity, both visually and in how they feel to the touch.\n\nPowertrain and driving experience.Powerful, efficient and supremely assured.\n\nThe line-up of powertrains for the new BMW 4 Series range comprises powerful and highly efficient petrol and diesel engines featuring BMW TwinPower Turbo technology and electrification in the form of 48V mild hybrid technology. All the drive units deliver an exceptional blend of sporting driving pleasure and fuel economy, all are part of the current modular generation of Efficient Dynamics engines and all are mated to an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission as standard. The shift paddles on the steering wheel, which also come as standard in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, allow quick manual interventions in the gear selection process, adding to the dynamic driving experience.\n\nStraight-six engines can be found under the bonnet of the M Performance versions in both model series (see separate chapter), as well as in the new BMW 430d xDrive Coupé and BMW 430d Convertible, whose diesel unit has an output of 210 kW/286 hp. The line-up also includes two four-cylinder petrol engines developing 135 kW/184 hp and 180 kW/245 hp respectively and a 140 kW/190 hp four-cylinder diesel. The engine’s power is fed to the road via either classical rear-wheel drive or the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system, depending on the model variant.\n\nMild hybrid technology optimises power delivery and efficiency.\n\nAll the six-cylinder in-line engines available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, as well as the four-cylinder diesel unit, come with 48V mild hybrid technology for sharper power delivery and greater efficiency. The auxiliary electric drive takes the form of a 48V starter generator and makes output of 8 kW/11 hp instantly available in response to the slightest movement of the accelerator. This electric boost enhances the drive system’s dynamic response when accelerating off the line and putting in mid-range bursts of speed. The electric drive unit also assists the engine when travelling at a constant speed, allowing it to operate within an efficiency-optimised load range as often as possible.\n\nThe mild hybrid system additionally allows the use of electric power recuperated via Brake Energy Regeneration and stored in a 48V battery. The energy harvested efficiently in this way is not only used for the auxiliary electric drive, but also fed to the 12V electrical system with the help of a voltage transformer. This allows the vehicle’s electrical consumers to be operated even more efficiently.\n\nBespoke chassis technology for a sporty driving experience.\n\nExcellent body rigidity, intelligent lightweight design, 50 : 50 weight distribution and optimised aerodynamic properties provide an ideal basis for endowing the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible with remarkably agile and dynamic handling abilities. This is further helped by sophisticated chassis technology that has been tuned precisely for the weight spread at hand.\n\nLift-related dampers refine the balance between captivating sporting prowess and superb long-distance comfort. Various options are available for customising the car’s character, including M Sport suspension, adaptive M suspension with variable sport steering, and M Sport brakes.\n\nWide variety of systems for automated driving and parking.\n\nThe range of systems for automated driving and parking is just as extensive. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are fitted as standard with the front collision warning system with brake intervention, Cruise Control with brake function, Speed Limit Info with no-overtaking indicator, manual Speed Limit Assist and Lane Departure Warning with lane return. The standout optional extra is the Driving Assistant Professional package comprising the Steering and Lane Control Assistant, Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function, automatic Speed Limit Assist, route speed control and traffic light recognition.\n\nPark Distance Control with sensors at both the front and rear is also part of standard specification. The Parking Assistant, likewise standard, enables automated manoeuvring into and out of parking spaces, as well as featuring a Reversing Assist Camera and the Reversing Assistant. There is also the option of the Parking Assistant Plus with Park View, Panorama View and Remote 3D View functions.\n\nThe M Performance models in the new BMW 4 Series range. Distinctive characters top the model range.\n\nThe new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible range is spearheaded by elite sporting models cast in the familiar M mould. The performance cars from BMW M GmbH showcase the dynamic potential woven into the vehicle concepts of the BMW 4 Series range to highly impressive effect. Extremely powerful six-cylinder in-line engines, a bespoke chassis set-up and signature M design cues both inside and out mark them out as a proposition apart.\n\nThe M Performance models in the BMW 4 Series are available with both petrol and diesel engines, each with a displacement of 3.0 litres. The M-typical performance attributes of these straight-six units are underpinned by, among other things, the latest M TwinPower Turbo technology – which is tailored individually to the engine at hand. Another shared feature is the 48V mild hybrid technology, whose output of 8 kW/11 hp produces an electric boost effect that gives the engines even sharper response.\n\nThe six-cylinder in-line petrol engine in the BMW M440i xDrive Coupé and BMW M440i xDrive Convertible generates maximum output of 275 kW/374 hp and peak torque of 500 Nm (369 lb-ft). The BMW M440d xDrive Coupé and BMW M440d xDrive Convertible, meanwhile, are powered by a straight-six diesel unit that produces maximum output of 250 kW/340 hp and peak torque of 700 Nm (516 lb-ft). M Sport suspension with variable sport steering can be found on the standard equipment list for the range-topping models, along with an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission with an ultra-sharp shift action, M Sport brakes and the M Sport differential.\n\nNew-look BMW kidney grille, black tailpipe finishers as standard.\n\nAn array of select design flourishes announces the dynamic character of the M Performance models even more vividly. For instance, the new edition of these models features a BMW kidney grille with a surround in Black high-gloss and horizontally arranged bars adorned by an M logo. All the front apron elements that were previously finished in Cerium Grey now come in Black high-gloss. As a result, the models’ appearance when viewed from the front recalls the design of the BMW M4 high-performance sports cars to an even greater extent.\n\nAt the rear end of the M Performance models, trapezoidal tailpipe trim signals the presence of the ultra-potent power unit under the bonnet. They are now in Black high-gloss as standard, meaning that all elements of the M High-gloss Shadowline trim option are already included in the standard specification of these models.\n\nExclusive touches: M exterior mirror caps, carbon fibre diffuser.\n\nAnother design element from the BMW M4 range has been incorporated into the flanks of the latest M Performance models from the BMW 4 Series, with M exterior mirrors in twin-stalk design included as a standard feature.\n\nThe optional M Carbon exterior package comprises exterior mirror caps and inserts for the outer air intakes made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The new BMW 4 Series Coupé also sports a carbon-fibre Gurney lip rear spoiler. This optional extra also adds a carbon-fibre diffuser in the lower section of the rear apron that is exclusive to the M Performance models.\n\nHeightened sports car ambience in the cabin.\n\nSport seats trimmed in the new M Performtex upholstery for Coupé models and Vernasca leather for the Convertible, interior trim elements in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite, M door sill trim, M pedals, an M driver’s footrest and M-specific graphics for the BMW Curved Display characterise the distinctive aura inside the M Performance models. M Sport seats trimmed in Vernasca leather can be specified as an option for the range-topping versions of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and are available in a choice of Black with blue contrast quilting or the new Black/Coral Red bi-colour finish.\n\nA new version of the M leather steering wheel turns up the sports car feel inside the flagship models another notch. Its flat-bottomed rim, red centre marker and contrast stitching in BMW M GmbH colours help to make the driving experience aboard the M Performance models in the new BMW 4 Series range even more engaging.\n\nDisplay and control/operation system, connectivity. The new BMW Operating System 8.5 and innovative digital services.\n\nThe advances made in terms of digitalisation in the latest edition of the BMW 4 Series are also clear to see. This is mainly thanks to the upgraded BMW iDrive display and control/operation system with QuickSelect based on BMW Operating System 8.5. In order to provide intuitive, easy control of numerous functions along with access to innovative digital services, the latest-generation BMW iDrive system fitted in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the new BMW 4 Series Convertible features a new-look home screen and QuickSelect rapid access tech, bringing an improved menu structure that takes its cue from consumer electronics devices.\n\nThe enhanced BMW iDrive featuring QuickSelect is packaged together with the BMW Curved Display and BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, meaning it has been carefully geared to operation using the touchscreen and natural language. The control/operation system in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible additionally comprises multifunction buttons on the steering wheel and, as an option, the BMW Head-Up Display. The new BMW iDrive helps to deliver a focused, assured driving experience by showing the right information in the right place.\n\nBMW iDrive with QuickSelect: functions shown on a single level and selectable with rapid-access tech.\n\nThe new BMW Operating System 8.5 home screen continuously displays the navigation system’s map view or other individually configurable graphics on the control display. On the same level, widgets appear in a vertical arrangement on the driver’s side of the display. Drivers can switch between them with a vertical swipe of the finger. The QuickSelect feature allows the function selected in this way to be activated directly without having to enter a submenu. And once the relevant settings have been chosen, a quick tap on the home icon at the lower edge of the control display is all it takes to return to the home screen. Icons for direct access to the climate control menu, All Apps menu and, if activated, Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ can also now be found next to the home icon.\n\nThe new flat menu structure makes it much easier to activate the desired functions and settings. The digital content – just like the hardware in the form of the BMW Curved Display – is designed to enhance the driver focus for which BMW is renowned.\n\nBMW Maps navigation system now with Augmented View.\n\nThe cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system forms part of the standard BMW Live Cockpit Plus. Following the introduction of BMW Operating System 8.5 in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, the system now makes it even easier to input destinations and can offer additional information while driving.\n\nAnother new feature is the Augmented View function which, like the BMW Head-Up Display, is available by specifying the optional BMW Live Cockpit Professional. This supplements the navigation system’s map display by showing a live video stream of the driver’s view on the control display or instrument cluster and augmenting it with tips and information to match the context. At confusing junctions, for instance, an animated directional arrow is integrated into the video image to help the driver take the best turn-off for the planned route. The Augmented View function can also come to the driver’s aid when searching for a parking spot by showing supplementary information.\n\nPersonalisation using the BMW ID and My BMW App.\n\nDrivers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible will also find it easier to use their BMW ID to personalise the user experience. In future, signing in to the vehicle by using a smartphone to scan a QR code is all it will take to import the customer’s personal profile, load synchronisable settings and automatically link the key detected in the vehicle with the BMW ID.\n\nThe vehicle is also added to the My BMW App without the customer having to do anything. Available free of charge from the app stores for both iOS and Android, the My BMW App acts as a universal digital interface that provides information at any time on the vehicle’s status, for example, its remaining range and any servicing and maintenance requirements. Depending on the car’s specification, it also enables remote operation of functions such as locating the vehicle, locking and unlocking the doors or monitoring the car’s immediate vicinity and interior with Remote View. The My BMW app can additionally be used to send destination addresses from a smartphone to the vehicle’s navigation system. The My Trips feature including Efficiency Trainer and monthly review provides the user with data and evaluations for distances travelled, fuel consumption and average speed.\n\nOptimum connectivity with Personal eSIM and 5G mobile standard.\n\nCustomers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the news BMW 4 Series Convertible can activate the Personal eSIM as standard, in addition to the vehicle’s built-in mobile SIM. This enables the vehicle to use the 5G mobile communications standard. The Personal eSIM allows the customer to use the communications and connectivity functions covered by their mobile contract from their car with ease – even in situations where they don’t have their smartphone with them. This also includes data streaming via the WiFi hotspot.\n\nA low-radiation connection to the vehicle’s exterior antenna is used for making phone calls and streaming data via the Personal eSIM. All phone functions can be operated with the BMW iDrive system or the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The Personal eSIM can be used in all countries where BMW Connected Drive services are available. It extends the customer’s existing mobile phone contract, which may result in additional costs.\n\nParking fees and fuel bills can be paid directly from the vehicle.\n\nIn many European countries, the BMW ID allows drivers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and BMW 4 Series Convertible to pay parking fees directly from their vehicle. The vehicle automatically detects whether the service is available upon arrival in a parking zone and displays the payment function if the zone is covered by one of the linked providers. The parking booking can be paid quickly and simply using the credit card registered in the My BMW App. The booking ends automatically when the vehicle exits the parking space again.\n\nAnd drivers in Germany also have the option of settling fuel bills digitally from their car as soon as they have refuelled at participating filling stations. As with the parking fee payment service, this is done using the credit card information first registered in the vehicle apps.\n\nBMW M Performance Parts.Fuelled by proven expertise in the world of motor sport.\n\nMore than ever, the inimitable combination of driving pleasure and elegantly sporty design presented by the new BMW 4 Series models sets them apart from the crowd in the premium segment of the midsize class.

Customers placed particular emphasis on the dynamic driving characteristics and emotionally rich design of both models, as well as a premium feel characterised by high material and build quality. By attracting such positive responses from customers, the BMW 4 Series models have made a significant contribution to further enhancing the brand’s profile as a maker of dynamically exceptional and elegantly sporty premium cars.\n\nDistinct characters with a shared focus on driving pleasure.\n\nFor the past two model generations, BMW has grouped its premium midsize coupés and convertibles into their own model range. This has highlighted their particularly intense focus on delivering the driving pleasure for which the brand is renowned. The differentiation between the new BMW 4 Series models and the BMW 3 Series in terms of design can be found not only in their proportions and lines, but also their distinctive front-end visuals. Wider tracks and specific tuning for their chassis technology lay the groundwork for superlative dynamic prowess. Within the BMW 4 Series range, the coupé and convertible models represent distinct characters whose individual vehicle concepts target different priorities.\n\nThe BMW 4 Series Coupé combines its dynamically flowing lines and elegantly stretched proportions with a body optimised for extra handling agility and boasting exceptional torsional rigidity, plus a chassis tuned squarely for dynamic excellence. The individual-seat character of the two rear seats helps to ensure that the passengers in the second row also enjoy an intense driving experience. The folding function of the three-section split rear seat bench increases the versatility of the interior when it comes to accommodating items for leisure activities and longer trips away.\n\nMeanwhile, passengers in the BMW 4 Series Convertible’s four seats can sample the sporty driving experience characteristic of the 4 Series together with the joy of open-top motoring. A particularly stylish sense of elegance, for which the car’s low-slung silhouette is principally responsible, also comes as standard. A highlight feature specific to the BMW 4 Series Convertible is its panel bow soft-top roof, which combines the solidity of a retractable hardtop with the classical aesthetic of a fabric hood. The roof’s electric drive mechanism can be activated while travelling at up to 50 km/h (31 mph); the opening/closing process takes 18 seconds.\n\nTaking steps to further reduce the company’s carbon footprint.\n\nHighly efficient engines, intelligent lightweight design and optimised aerodynamic attributes make a significant contribution to enhancing driving pleasure in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, at the same time as lowering fuel consumption and emissions. Meanwhile, the 48V mild hybrid technology deployed on certain models sharpens power delivery and improves efficiency. As well as the bonnet, front side panels and doors, numerous chassis components are also made from aluminium. And with a Cd as low as 0.25 in the case of the coupé and as low as 0.27 for the convertible, the two models can claim an impressive drag coefficient.\n\nIn the interests of creating an even more sustainable overall concept, growing importance is attached to the use of secondary raw materials –alongside further optimised use of materials and energy-optimised production methods. For the BMW brand, the twin goals of increasing sustainability and achieving premium standards are inextricably linked, rather than competing factors.\n\nExterior design. Striking visual cues point the way to captivating dynamics.\n\nSporting potency and elegance are the key themes reflected with authenticity in the design of the BMW 4 Series models. Precise modifications to their exterior visuals enable the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible to express their unique characters even more clearly. The new features sharpen the profile of the two models and provide eye-catching pointers to their captivating dynamics, exclusivity and technological advances.\n\nWith their distinctive lines and clean surface treatment in the brand’s modern design language, the coupé and convertible members of the BMW 4 Series line-up exude driving pleasure and inimitable style. The features of the optional M Sport package add further punch to the cars’ dynamic appearance. They include a diffuser element in the lower section of the rear bumper, which is now painted in Black high-gloss. In addition, the exhaust tailpipes integrated into the rear apron on the left and right have grown from 90 millimetres to 100 millimetres in diameter. As an extension to the M Sport package, customers can also order their cars with the M Sport package Pro and M Carbon exterior package.\n\nNewly designed headlights, innovative Laserlight rear lights.\n\nDesign cues specific to the BMW 4 Series include the visually powerful front end shaped by slim LED headlights and a vertically arranged BMW kidney grille. The air intakes of the strikingly forward-angled grille have a mesh structure, both in standard form and if the M Sport package is specified. Their surround now comes in matt chrome.\n\nThe new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible also feature visually and functionally upgraded headlights. The LED units in their inner workings, which provide all the light functions, have been redesigned and have a new structure. Low and high beam are generated from a single LED module. And a pair of vertical and subtly arrow-shaped LED units house the side light, daytime driving light and turn signal indicator functions. The technically focused look of the new light sources gives the headlights a high-quality and progressive appearance.\n\nAdaptive LED Headlights with non-dazzling matrix high beam are available as an option. They can be identified by blue inlays and include urban lights and a cornering light function. The prism structure of the LED units for the urban lights provides a striking contrast against the uniform illumination of the daytime driving light units.\n\nAlso offered as part of the M Sport package Pro and if the Adaptive LED Headlights are specified are M Shadowline lights with dark inner accents. If the optional Comfort Access is fitted, the headlights generate a Welcome Light Animation once the driver and vehicle key come within three metres of the car.\n\nExamples of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible specified with Adaptive LED Headlights are also fitted with super-expressive Laserlight rear lights. This model-specific version of an innovative lighting effect employs a technology first seen in the BMW M4 CSL high-performance special edition produced in a limited run of 1,000 examples. Here, laser diodes each illuminate a fibre optic bundle, giving the rear units an intricate light graphic. The precise lines of the three-dimensional Laserlight gives these rear lights – which are making their debut in a volume-produced car – an exclusive and unmistakable design.\n\nNew exterior paint shades and light-alloy wheels.\n\nCustomers can give the outside of their new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible a personal touch with a choice of two solid and eight metallic paint finishes. Cape York Green metallic and Fire Red metallic are new additions to the range. And a wide variety of BMW Individual paint finishes and BMW Individual special paint finishes are also offered.\n\nAttractive new additions can also be found in the selection of optional light-alloy wheels. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are both offered for the first time with three new 19-inch variants. The new M light-alloy wheels in double-spoke design can be ordered in either Jet Black or a bi-colour finish. And the new BMW Individual light-alloy wheels also have a Y-spoke design and are finished in Midnight Grey.\n\nInterior and equipment. Progressive style and an aura of carefully honed refinement.\n\nStandard-fitted sport seats and newly designed steering wheels feed into the intensity of the driving experience in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible. The large BMW Curved Display brings a fresh and particularly modern interpretation of the driver focus for which the brand is renowned. High-quality, meticulously crafted materials and a new operating concept for ventilation and climate control systems add to the cockpit’s premium allure. The modifications carried out to the interior of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible ensure those on board can enjoy driving pleasure with progressive style and long-distance comfort in an ambience of carefully honed refinement.\n\nAmong the cutting-edge new features is a version of the optionally available seat surfaces that is making its debut in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and is produced using more sustainable methods. Added to which, new interior trim strips are available for both the coupé and convertible. And standard specification now also includes ambient lighting and electrically folding exterior mirrors. The range of optional equipment has been restructured to enable particularly targeted individualisation.\n\nNew steering wheels with standard gearshift paddles.\n\nThe latest-generation steering wheels available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible stand out with their modern and sporty design. As standard, the driver will find in front of them a newly designed sports leather steering wheel with a polygonal rim and two spokes. The M Sport package now brings an M leather steering wheel in three-spoke design with a flat-bottomed rim and a discreet centre marking.\n\nBoth versions of the newly designed steering wheels have illuminated multifunction buttons and gearshift paddles. Now fitted as standard, the paddles enable particularly swift manual interventions in the gear selection process and underscore the sharper sporting profile of the new BMW 4 Series models.\n\nDetail revisions for the instrument panel, digital climate control.\n\nThe introduction of the upgraded BMW iDrive with QuickSelect also brings improved operation of the ventilation and climate control functions in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and in the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. This is a prime example of advanced digitalisation at work and enables a further reduction in the number of physical buttons and controls in the cockpit. Temperature selection, intensity of ventilation and – if the relevant features are specified – seat and steering wheel heating can now be adjusted by touch via the BMW Curved Display or by voice command with the help of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. New adjustment controls for the air vent grilles in the centre of the instrument panel and on the driver’s and front passenger side of the cockpit allow the direction of airflow to be adjusted using rotating and tilting movements. Specifying optional Sensatec trim for the instrument panel means customers will now find a further refined surface structure which further highlights the interior’s modern premium ambience.\n\nThe standard ambient lighting in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible now also includes contour lighting integrated into the trim around the central seam vents. Like the lighting for the footwells, the storage compartment in the front section of the centre console and the door openers, this can be adjusted for colour and brightness according to personal preference. Users can choose from nine colours. The functionality of the interior lighting also includes an atmospheric Welcome and Goodbye Animation and light signals indicating an open door or incoming phone call.\n\nPremiere for M Performtex seat covers in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé.\n\nThe standard-fit sport seats combine with interior surfaces in Sensatec perforated. The Vernasca leather trim with decorative quilting available as an option for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and for the new BMW 4 Series Convertible is now also offered in the new bi-colour variant Black/Red. And both models can also be specified with BMW Individual Merino leather trim in three colours.\n\nWhen ordered with the M Sport package or in M Performance form, the new BMW 4 Series Coupé comes with seat surfaces in black M Performtex. Making its debut in a BMW model, this velours covering combines high material quality and a sporty design with low weight and a sustainability-optimised production method.\n\nNew interior trim strips, exclusive touches with CraftedClarity.\n\nThe selection of available interior trim strips has also been extensively revised, with Dark Graphite matt now standard specification for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible. The M Sport package includes interior trim strips in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite. Also on the options list are Fineline Light open-pored and Grey Blue Ash open-pored fine-wood trim, and M interior trim carbon fibre.\n\nThe use of extremely high-quality materials also allows distinctive touches to be included in other areas of the interior to enhance its modern premium character. Electroplated applications for the control panel in the doors, which includes the window controls and locking switch, are available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the new BMW 4 Series Convertible. And customers can also specify CraftedClarity glass applications – another new addition to the options list. These give the gear selector lever, BMW iDrive Controller and Start/Stop button a particular air of exclusivity, both visually and in how they feel to the touch.\n\nPowertrain and driving experience.Powerful, efficient and supremely assured.\n\nThe line-up of powertrains for the new BMW 4 Series range comprises powerful and highly efficient petrol and diesel engines featuring BMW TwinPower Turbo technology and electrification in the form of 48V mild hybrid technology. All the drive units deliver an exceptional blend of sporting driving pleasure and fuel economy, all are part of the current modular generation of Efficient Dynamics engines and all are mated to an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission as standard. The shift paddles on the steering wheel, which also come as standard in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, allow quick manual interventions in the gear selection process, adding to the dynamic driving experience.\n\nStraight-six engines can be found under the bonnet of the M Performance versions in both model series (see separate chapter), as well as in the new BMW 430d xDrive Coupé and BMW 430d Convertible, whose diesel unit has an output of 210 kW/286 hp. The line-up also includes two four-cylinder petrol engines developing 135 kW/184 hp and 180 kW/245 hp respectively and a 140 kW/190 hp four-cylinder diesel. The engine’s power is fed to the road via either classical rear-wheel drive or the BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel-drive system, depending on the model variant.\n\nMild hybrid technology optimises power delivery and efficiency.\n\nAll the six-cylinder in-line engines available for the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, as well as the four-cylinder diesel unit, come with 48V mild hybrid technology for sharper power delivery and greater efficiency. The auxiliary electric drive takes the form of a 48V starter generator and makes output of 8 kW/11 hp instantly available in response to the slightest movement of the accelerator. This electric boost enhances the drive system’s dynamic response when accelerating off the line and putting in mid-range bursts of speed. The electric drive unit also assists the engine when travelling at a constant speed, allowing it to operate within an efficiency-optimised load range as often as possible.\n\nThe mild hybrid system additionally allows the use of electric power recuperated via Brake Energy Regeneration and stored in a 48V battery. The energy harvested efficiently in this way is not only used for the auxiliary electric drive, but also fed to the 12V electrical system with the help of a voltage transformer. This allows the vehicle’s electrical consumers to be operated even more efficiently.\n\nBespoke chassis technology for a sporty driving experience.\n\nExcellent body rigidity, intelligent lightweight design, 50 : 50 weight distribution and optimised aerodynamic properties provide an ideal basis for endowing the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible with remarkably agile and dynamic handling abilities. This is further helped by sophisticated chassis technology that has been tuned precisely for the weight spread at hand.\n\nLift-related dampers refine the balance between captivating sporting prowess and superb long-distance comfort. Various options are available for customising the car’s character, including M Sport suspension, adaptive M suspension with variable sport steering, and M Sport brakes.\n\nWide variety of systems for automated driving and parking.\n\nThe range of systems for automated driving and parking is just as extensive. The new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible are fitted as standard with the front collision warning system with brake intervention, Cruise Control with brake function, Speed Limit Info with no-overtaking indicator, manual Speed Limit Assist and Lane Departure Warning with lane return. The standout optional extra is the Driving Assistant Professional package comprising the Steering and Lane Control Assistant, Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function, automatic Speed Limit Assist, route speed control and traffic light recognition.\n\nPark Distance Control with sensors at both the front and rear is also part of standard specification. The Parking Assistant, likewise standard, enables automated manoeuvring into and out of parking spaces, as well as featuring a Reversing Assist Camera and the Reversing Assistant. There is also the option of the Parking Assistant Plus with Park View, Panorama View and Remote 3D View functions.\n\nThe M Performance models in the new BMW 4 Series range. Distinctive characters top the model range.\n\nThe new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible range is spearheaded by elite sporting models cast in the familiar M mould. The performance cars from BMW M GmbH showcase the dynamic potential woven into the vehicle concepts of the BMW 4 Series range to highly impressive effect. Extremely powerful six-cylinder in-line engines, a bespoke chassis set-up and signature M design cues both inside and out mark them out as a proposition apart.\n\nThe M Performance models in the BMW 4 Series are available with both petrol and diesel engines, each with a displacement of 3.0 litres. The M-typical performance attributes of these straight-six units are underpinned by, among other things, the latest M TwinPower Turbo technology – which is tailored individually to the engine at hand. Another shared feature is the 48V mild hybrid technology, whose output of 8 kW/11 hp produces an electric boost effect that gives the engines even sharper response.\n\nThe six-cylinder in-line petrol engine in the BMW M440i xDrive Coupé and BMW M440i xDrive Convertible generates maximum output of 275 kW/374 hp and peak torque of 500 Nm (369 lb-ft). The BMW M440d xDrive Coupé and BMW M440d xDrive Convertible, meanwhile, are powered by a straight-six diesel unit that produces maximum output of 250 kW/340 hp and peak torque of 700 Nm (516 lb-ft). M Sport suspension with variable sport steering can be found on the standard equipment list for the range-topping models, along with an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission with an ultra-sharp shift action, M Sport brakes and the M Sport differential.\n\nNew-look BMW kidney grille, black tailpipe finishers as standard.\n\nAn array of select design flourishes announces the dynamic character of the M Performance models even more vividly. For instance, the new edition of these models features a BMW kidney grille with a surround in Black high-gloss and horizontally arranged bars adorned by an M logo. All the front apron elements that were previously finished in Cerium Grey now come in Black high-gloss. As a result, the models’ appearance when viewed from the front recalls the design of the BMW M4 high-performance sports cars to an even greater extent.\n\nAt the rear end of the M Performance models, trapezoidal tailpipe trim signals the presence of the ultra-potent power unit under the bonnet. They are now in Black high-gloss as standard, meaning that all elements of the M High-gloss Shadowline trim option are already included in the standard specification of these models.\n\nExclusive touches: M exterior mirror caps, carbon fibre diffuser.\n\nAnother design element from the BMW M4 range has been incorporated into the flanks of the latest M Performance models from the BMW 4 Series, with M exterior mirrors in twin-stalk design included as a standard feature.\n\nThe optional M Carbon exterior package comprises exterior mirror caps and inserts for the outer air intakes made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The new BMW 4 Series Coupé also sports a carbon-fibre Gurney lip rear spoiler. This optional extra also adds a carbon-fibre diffuser in the lower section of the rear apron that is exclusive to the M Performance models.\n\nHeightened sports car ambience in the cabin.\n\nSport seats trimmed in the new M Performtex upholstery for Coupé models and Vernasca leather for the Convertible, interior trim elements in Aluminium Rhombicle Anthracite, M door sill trim, M pedals, an M driver’s footrest and M-specific graphics for the BMW Curved Display characterise the distinctive aura inside the M Performance models. M Sport seats trimmed in Vernasca leather can be specified as an option for the range-topping versions of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and are available in a choice of Black with blue contrast quilting or the new Black/Coral Red bi-colour finish.\n\nA new version of the M leather steering wheel turns up the sports car feel inside the flagship models another notch. Its flat-bottomed rim, red centre marker and contrast stitching in BMW M GmbH colours help to make the driving experience aboard the M Performance models in the new BMW 4 Series range even more engaging.\n\nDisplay and control/operation system, connectivity. The new BMW Operating System 8.5 and innovative digital services.\n\nThe advances made in terms of digitalisation in the latest edition of the BMW 4 Series are also clear to see. This is mainly thanks to the upgraded BMW iDrive display and control/operation system with QuickSelect based on BMW Operating System 8.5. In order to provide intuitive, easy control of numerous functions along with access to innovative digital services, the latest-generation BMW iDrive system fitted in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the new BMW 4 Series Convertible features a new-look home screen and QuickSelect rapid access tech, bringing an improved menu structure that takes its cue from consumer electronics devices.\n\nThe enhanced BMW iDrive featuring QuickSelect is packaged together with the BMW Curved Display and BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, meaning it has been carefully geared to operation using the touchscreen and natural language. The control/operation system in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible additionally comprises multifunction buttons on the steering wheel and, as an option, the BMW Head-Up Display. The new BMW iDrive helps to deliver a focused, assured driving experience by showing the right information in the right place.\n\nBMW iDrive with QuickSelect: functions shown on a single level and selectable with rapid-access tech.\n\nThe new BMW Operating System 8.5 home screen continuously displays the navigation system’s map view or other individually configurable graphics on the control display. On the same level, widgets appear in a vertical arrangement on the driver’s side of the display. Drivers can switch between them with a vertical swipe of the finger. The QuickSelect feature allows the function selected in this way to be activated directly without having to enter a submenu. And once the relevant settings have been chosen, a quick tap on the home icon at the lower edge of the control display is all it takes to return to the home screen. Icons for direct access to the climate control menu, All Apps menu and, if activated, Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ can also now be found next to the home icon.\n\nThe new flat menu structure makes it much easier to activate the desired functions and settings. The digital content – just like the hardware in the form of the BMW Curved Display – is designed to enhance the driver focus for which BMW is renowned.\n\nBMW Maps navigation system now with Augmented View.\n\nThe cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system forms part of the standard BMW Live Cockpit Plus. Following the introduction of BMW Operating System 8.5 in the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible, the system now makes it even easier to input destinations and can offer additional information while driving.\n\nAnother new feature is the Augmented View function which, like the BMW Head-Up Display, is available by specifying the optional BMW Live Cockpit Professional. This supplements the navigation system’s map display by showing a live video stream of the driver’s view on the control display or instrument cluster and augmenting it with tips and information to match the context. At confusing junctions, for instance, an animated directional arrow is integrated into the video image to help the driver take the best turn-off for the planned route. The Augmented View function can also come to the driver’s aid when searching for a parking spot by showing supplementary information.\n\nPersonalisation using the BMW ID and My BMW App.\n\nDrivers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible will also find it easier to use their BMW ID to personalise the user experience. In future, signing in to the vehicle by using a smartphone to scan a QR code is all it will take to import the customer’s personal profile, load synchronisable settings and automatically link the key detected in the vehicle with the BMW ID.\n\nThe vehicle is also added to the My BMW App without the customer having to do anything. Available free of charge from the app stores for both iOS and Android, the My BMW App acts as a universal digital interface that provides information at any time on the vehicle’s status, for example, its remaining range and any servicing and maintenance requirements. Depending on the car’s specification, it also enables remote operation of functions such as locating the vehicle, locking and unlocking the doors or monitoring the car’s immediate vicinity and interior with Remote View. The My BMW app can additionally be used to send destination addresses from a smartphone to the vehicle’s navigation system. The My Trips feature including Efficiency Trainer and monthly review provides the user with data and evaluations for distances travelled, fuel consumption and average speed.\n\nOptimum connectivity with Personal eSIM and 5G mobile standard.\n\nCustomers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and the news BMW 4 Series Convertible can activate the Personal eSIM as standard, in addition to the vehicle’s built-in mobile SIM. This enables the vehicle to use the 5G mobile communications standard. The Personal eSIM allows the customer to use the communications and connectivity functions covered by their mobile contract from their car with ease – even in situations where they don’t have their smartphone with them. This also includes data streaming via the WiFi hotspot.\n\nA low-radiation connection to the vehicle’s exterior antenna is used for making phone calls and streaming data via the Personal eSIM. All phone functions can be operated with the BMW iDrive system or the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The Personal eSIM can be used in all countries where BMW Connected Drive services are available. It extends the customer’s existing mobile phone contract, which may result in additional costs.\n\nParking fees and fuel bills can be paid directly from the vehicle.\n\nIn many European countries, the BMW ID allows drivers of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and BMW 4 Series Convertible to pay parking fees directly from their vehicle. The vehicle automatically detects whether the service is available upon arrival in a parking zone and displays the payment function if the zone is covered by one of the linked providers. The parking booking can be paid quickly and simply using the credit card registered in the My BMW App. The booking ends automatically when the vehicle exits the parking space again.\n\nAnd drivers in Germany also have the option of settling fuel bills digitally from their car as soon as they have refuelled at participating filling stations. As with the parking fee payment service, this is done using the credit card information first registered in the vehicle apps.\n\nBMW M Performance Parts.Fuelled by proven expertise in the world of motor sport.\n\nMore than ever, the inimitable combination of driving pleasure and elegantly sporty design presented by the new BMW 4 Series models sets them apart from the crowd in the premium segment of the midsize class. The vehicle concept underpinning the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible offers extraordinary potential for delivering superior driving characteristics. And now the latest upgrades for the exterior and interior are available to showcase their dynamic character with even greater intensity. Alongside the M Sport package, M Sport package Pro and M Carbon exterior package available as factory-fit options, the items included in the BMW M Performance Parts range offer further scope for sharpening the profile of the new BMW 4 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Convertible in careful detail.\n\nThe model-specific retrofit options from the Original BMW Accessories range were developed using the proven expertise of BMW M GmbH in motor sport.

The BMW Golf Cup World Final for the 2023 season at Fancourt Resort in South Africa drew to a close with a visit from golfing legend Gary Player (RSA) and many reasons to celebrate. Victory in the national competition went to the team from Mexico (303 points), ahead of Team Vietnam (278) and Team Italy (276). Over the course of the tournament, the players carded 49 eagles. This allowed the BMW Group to support UNICEF* with € 49,000, raised at the World Final alone, to be used on educational programmes in crisis regions.\n\n“Congratulations to the Mexican team and the individual winners at the BMW Golf Cup World Final, who came out on top against international opposition at this high-class tournament,” said Peter van Binsbergen, CEO BMW Group South Africa. “Furthermore, everyone who has experienced this unforgettable week is really a winner. A palpable sense of community has developed across all the cultures and nationalities, fuelled by the shared joy of golf and the delight generated by such a fantastic host country. The fact that the BMW Group is also able to donate € 49,000 to UNICEF is the icing on the cake.”\n\nThe BMW Group and UNICEF* are collaborating in the partnership ‘BRIDGE. Educating young people for tomorrow, today’, focussing on educational projects in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in countries, which have programme needs and a BMW Group presence. They include Brazil, India, Mexico and Thailand, as well as South Africa.\n\nWithin the framework of ‘BRIDGE’, the BMW Group also has the opportunity raise funds to support UNICEF’s work in emergencies and protracted crises. The United Nation’s International Children’s Fund uses these resources to support children to develop skills to cope with trauma and to provide them with a safe environment in which to continue their learning. The amount raised through ‘Eagles For Education’ at the BMW Golf Cup World Final is also used to support educational programmes of this type in crisis regions.\n\nIn addition to the national competitions, individual champions were also crowned at the BMW Golf Cup World Final in the Men’s A (up to HCP 12), Men’s B (HCP 13-28) and Ladies (HCP up to 28) classes. The titles went to Macarena Aceval Acosta (MEX, 105, Ladies), Ching Hua Tsai (111, TPE, Men’s A), and Marco Solzi (ITA, 105, Men’s B).\n\nThe trophies were presented to the winners at the closing Gala Dinner by South African golf legend Gary Player, who could not pass up the opportunity to visit the BMW Golf Cup World Final. This was something of a home outing for the 88-year-old winner of 18 majors, as the three spectacular golf courses at Fancourt Resort – The Links, Montagu and Outeniqua – are his designs.\n\n“It is a great pleasure for me to be involved in the World Final – and not just because this fantastic and established competition is taking place in my country and because Fancourt will always be a special place for me,” said Player. “The BMW Golf Cup brings out the best in our beautiful game: ambition and high-class competition, but also respect for one another, the forging of friendships and the sharing of joyful moments. And finally, ‘Eagles for Education’ is ensuring that we don’t forget the most vulnerable – the children. Supporting them has always been especially important to me and my late wife Vivian.”\n\nDespite his age, it is still clear to see that Player is one of the biggest and most charismatic golfers in the history of the sport. The delighted participants and their guests were able to admire him at close hand, as the ‘Black Knight’ invited them to an exclusive golf clinic on the Friday – an experience that those present will remember for a long time, along with the many fascinating insights into the rich culture and natural wealth of South Africa and the warmth of the locals.\n\n*UNICEF does not endorse any company, brand, product or service."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Trio from Mexico triumphs against 27 other countries in South Africa +++ 49 ‘Eagles for Education’: BMW Group donates € 49,000 to UNICEF +++ Gary Player delights guests at Fancourt on ‘his’ course +++"}]}

Mixed feelings for the BMW M Motorsport teams after the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) race at Road America (USA). BMW M Team RLL had a challenging weekend with its two BMW M Hybrid V8s. There was great celebration among the BMW M4 GT3 crews as Turner Motorsport celebrated a class victory in the GTD category. In the GTD PRO, Paul Miller Racing finished in second place .\n\nFor Turner Motorsport, the class victory by BMW M works driver Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) marked the end of a long dry spell. The team, led by team principal Will Turner, had last stood at the top of the IMSA podium in 2022 at Mid-Ohio (USA). For the BMW M4 GT3, it was the eagerly awaited first triumph of the current IMSA season. After their third podium of the season, with a second place at Long Beach (USA) and a third at Laguna Seca (USA), Foley and Gallagher are in a promising position in the GTD drivers' standings. Paul Miller Racing saw an end to a difficult time this season. The podium finish for BMW M works driver Madison Snow and Bryan Sellers (both USA) was the team's first since the third place at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) at the start of the season.\n\nBMW M Team RLL’s two BMW M Hybrid V8s did not achieve the hoped-for first podium of the season. Philipp Eng (AUT) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) missed qualifying due to an accident in practice but fought their way from the back of the GTP class field to seventh place in the race. Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) were in contention for podium positions in the first hour of the race, but then Yelloly lost control of the car, slid into the track barrier, and retired. Fortunately, Yelloly was uninjured.\n\nBMW M Motorsport welcomes Champion as Official Partner.\n\nThe two BMW M Hybrid V8s in the IMSA series and the BMW M4 GT3 of René Rast (GER) in the DTM now sport a new logo. The traditional spark plug manufacturer Champion Ignition joins the BMW M Motorsport family as an Official Partner, supporting the two prestigious racing programmes in North America and Europe.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Champion Ignition as Official Partner of BMW M Motorsport,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. \"This is a great fit as our brands are united in engineering excellence and technology leadership. We are looking forward to making this a successful collaboration across our motorsport programmes in IMSA and DTM.” Ananth Parameswaran, Vice President and General Manager of Champion Ignition, said: “Growing rapidly in the OE space with a commitment to engineering, technology, and customer satisfaction, Champion has become one of the world’s largest suppliers of OE spark plugs. This partnership will bring together our brand heritage in racing with our OE pedigree to enhance awareness and build excitement around Champion.”\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Unfortunately, the breakthrough we hoped for with our BMW M Hybrid V8 crews did not happen at Road America, and we were unable to translate the good approaches we showed in practice into corresponding results. That is disappointing. The #24 car managed an improvement from the very back of the GTP starting grid to seventh place after missing qualifying. We lost the sister car from a good position due to an accident. I'm glad that nothing happened to Nick Yelloly. We will continue to work hard to turn things around this season and reward ourselves with good results. Congratulations to Turner Motorsport on the class win and the first success of a BMW M Motorsport team in the current IMSA season. We were close several times and have achieved podium places with the BMW M4 GT3, but it was only now that we made it to the very top of the podium. Congratulations again to Paul Miller Racing for the second place in the GTD PRO class. I hope we can add more successes in the second half of the season.”\n\nJesse Krohn (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, 7th place): “After missing qualifying, we were obviously on the backfoot and tried a strategy that would move us forward. Unfortunately, the yellow phases came at times when we couldn't benefit from them so in the end, seventh place was the maximum, even though we could show good pace on a clear track.”\n\nNick Yelloly (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “There's not much to say about my accident. I went a bit too far on the curb on cold tyres, the underbody hit the curb, and I slid into the tyre barrier. Luckily, I wasn't hurt.”\n\nRobby Foley (#96 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place GTD class): “What a great day for the entire team! Turner Motorsport is like a second family to me, and I'm incredibly happy to be able to give them all this win. It was a constant up and down in this race, and I never knew if we had the right strategy or not. Luckily, it worked out in the end. We could have had one or two class victories earlier this season. It's all the more beautiful that it has finally worked out now. Thanks to everyone for this fantastic job today.”\n\nMadison Snow (#1 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place GTD PRO class): “We stayed strong in this turbulent race, fought until the end, did a good job in all areas, and thus kept ourselves in the leading group.

I hope we can add more successes in the second half of the season.”\n\nJesse Krohn (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, 7th place): “After missing qualifying, we were obviously on the backfoot and tried a strategy that would move us forward. Unfortunately, the yellow phases came at times when we couldn't benefit from them so in the end, seventh place was the maximum, even though we could show good pace on a clear track.”\n\nNick Yelloly (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “There's not much to say about my accident. I went a bit too far on the curb on cold tyres, the underbody hit the curb, and I slid into the tyre barrier. Luckily, I wasn't hurt.”\n\nRobby Foley (#96 BMW M4 GT3, 1st place GTD class): “What a great day for the entire team! Turner Motorsport is like a second family to me, and I'm incredibly happy to be able to give them all this win. It was a constant up and down in this race, and I never knew if we had the right strategy or not. Luckily, it worked out in the end. We could have had one or two class victories earlier this season. It's all the more beautiful that it has finally worked out now. Thanks to everyone for this fantastic job today.”\n\nMadison Snow (#1 BMW M4 GT3, 2nd place GTD PRO class): “We stayed strong in this turbulent race, fought until the end, did a good job in all areas, and thus kept ourselves in the leading group. That was crucial for this second place.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Provide concise, informative summaries that capture the key points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the following BMW news article in a concise way.\n\nSpartanburg / Munich. Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Group’s mission with its new high-performance test vehicle – the #BMW Vision Driving Experience. This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse – the next generation of BMW vehicles – and referred to by BMW as the #Heart of Joy. The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension – BMW’s hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure – to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.\n\n“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”\n\nThe Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.\n\nEnergy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range. By contrast, conventional systems have separate control algorithms for the drive system and brakes.

Showcasing driving pleasure up to the physical limits is the BMW Group’s mission with its new high-performance test vehicle – the #BMW Vision Driving Experience. This Vision Vehicle is not destined for series production, but is instead serving as a rolling test rig for drivetrain and driving dynamics management technology developed specially for the Neue Klasse – the next generation of BMW vehicles – and referred to by BMW as the #Heart of Joy. The prototype car put the capabilities of the Heart of Joy to the ultimate test of endurance at the BMW Performance Driving Center in Spartanburg, USA. And the company provided exclusive insights into its development programme for the electric driving experience on board the Neue Klasse as part of a preview presentation. Every fully electric Neue Klasse model will benefit from the Heart of Joy. The first taller Neue Klasse electric model will go into series production later this year at Plant Debrecen in Hungary. The new Heart of Joy adds a fourth dimension – BMW’s hallmark Sheer Driving Pleasure – to the existing trio of Neue Klasse characteristics (electrical, digital, circular). Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, took to the stage at the IAA 2023 show holding the small black box. It is important to note that the control unit will go into series production, but the Vision Vehicle will not.\n\n“The Heart of Joy enables us to take driving pleasure not just to the next level, but another one beyond that,” says Frank Weber, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Development. “In addition, we are further increasing efficiency, and therefore boosting range, as in future the driver will brake almost exclusively using energy regeneration. This is Efficient Dynamics squared.”\n\nThe Heart of Joy control unit for the drivetrain, brakes, charging, recuperation and steering subfunctions processes information ten times faster than previous systems. Working in tandem with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software, the Heart of Joy computes all the driving dynamics functions with a whole new level of speed and precision. The software has been developed entirely in-house on the back of experience in the field of driving dynamics amassed by BMW engineers over more than a century. The Vision Vehicle develops 18,000 Newton metres (13,269 lb-ft) of torque. The reasoning behind this is that if the control system can deal with an explosion of power of this magnitude, it will be able to handle the demands of everyday driving with ease.\n\nEnergy recovery under braking (also known as recuperation) sees the drivetrain and braking functions of electric vehicles forming a symbiosis. In the innovative electronics architecture of the Neue Klasse, the Heart of Joy is one of four central control units and combines drivetrain and driving dynamics functions for the first time. These innovative control functions are protected by several patent applications. The high-performance unit controls acceleration and braking, vehicle stabilisation, dynamic steering functions and charging management. The central processing unit and perfectly coordinated BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed in-house enable all connected actuators to respond directly and with minimal delay: latencies are in the millisecond range.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had a solid weekend with strong results for Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) during the fourth round of the FIM Superbike World Championship at Cremona (ITA). Razgatlioglu rode his BMW M 1000 RR to second place in both the Superpole Race and the two main races, collecting important points for both World Championship standings. Teammate van der Mark impressed in Lombardy with great battles and celebrated three top-ten placements. In the riders' standings, Razgatlioglu confidently defended his second overall position, keeping the gap to the leader Nicolò Bulega (ITA), who won all three races, within limits. The fifth event of the WorldSBK 2025 will be held in two weeks (May 16-18) at Most, Czech Republic.\n\nReactions after the Cremona round:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “We can be very proud of the team's performance over the past weeks. You can see how hard we are fighting to get back to the top. After Assen, we have made a significant step forward and are more consistent. Toprak is right behind Bulega - we have already left the rest of the field behind us, which is crucial for us. We have closed the gap and can continue to work in the same way. Positive signs are also visible with Mikey. On the short track, everything was incredibly tight, a tenth faster in qualifying and the whole weekend would have looked different. He continues to work on his riding style to be fast as well. Overall, we definitely had a positive weekend. We look forward with confidence and will continue to give everything so that we will soon be back at the top again.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: \"It was literally a hot race. Even though the results might not fully reflect it, Mickey's performance was very strong. In qualifying, he was less than a tenth away from fifth place, so a P5 pace was evident both in qualifying and in the races. However, the track is very peculiar and offers very few overtaking opportunities, which made it difficult for him to move forward. Generally, the pace was higher than the race result indicates. Consequently, the weekend was very satisfying. Toprak maximised the high track temperatures and proved with his three second-places that we continue to be competitive and that our package is podium-capable this year as well. To become victory-capable, we still need to find a bit more. We continue to work intensively on this. But Toprak is giving his all, the BMW is giving its all, the team has continued to work hard and made no mistakes. We have improved from session to session in lap times and performance, the gaps have been getting smaller. Overall, it was a very successful race weekend.\"\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This weekend was a hard weekend, we’ve tried to improve the bike, from session to session, especially because I couldn’t race here last year. We did a very good job, because everbody was working so hard and every session we were able to improve the bike. Unfortunately not enough to win a race but P2 is better than nothing, especially after Assen. We also took very good points for the championship, so we are all in all happy. And we for sure will never give up. I like the race at Most and I’m usually very good there, so I will try to do my best again and will try to fight for the wins.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had a consistent weekend. We improved quite a lot but on this track it is so hard to overtake as everyone is doing the same pace. Our pace in every race has been good but track position is very important – and we were a bit unlucky in terms of position in every race actually. We scored some good points but for sure we want to fight for at least top-five. So we have to improve the package.

Beginning in the 2026 season, BMW M Motorsport will offer private customer teams around the world a new entry point into racing: the BMW M2 Racing. Development and testing are entering a critical phase this year, and the new BMW M2 Racing was officially presented to the public just before its market launch during the DTM season opener at Oschersleben (GER).\n\nDetailed information on the new car can be found in the Media Guide, available as a downloadable PDF in the attachment and on the BMW Group PressClub.\n\n“With the introduction of the BMW M2 Racing, we are continuing a proud tradition,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “Like its predecessors – the BMW M235i Racing, BMW M240i Racing, and BMW M2 CS Racing – the new BMW M2 Racing will redefine the entry-level segment. The car is affordable while offering racing teams and drivers uncompromising performance, durability, and pure driving pleasure. At BMW M Motorsport, supporting customer racing with cars that are easy to maintain, cost-efficient, and thrilling to drive is a top priority.”\n\nThe new BMW M2 Racing delivers 230 kW / 313 hp to the track and reaches a top speed of over 270 km/h. It is based on the chassis of the current M2 generation, which is enhanced with numerous racing components. The base version of the BMW M2 Racing is priced at €98,000 (net) in the EU and is distributed through selected BMW M Motorsport dealers.\n\n“With the BMW M2 Racing, we’ve succeeded in bringing an entry-level customer racing model to the track that combines driving pleasure, performance, and particularly intuitive handling,” explained Björn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport. “The development was carried out in close collaboration between BMW M Motorsport and experts from series production. The result is a powerful race car that combines easy operation with low running costs. This efficiency makes the BMW M2 Racing particularly attractive for grassroots motorsport – and makes racing even more accessible for customers.”\n\nBMW M works drivers are behind the wheel during intensive test sessions, some under race conditions, helping to optimise the BMW M2 Racing in terms of performance, drivability, tyre wear, and mileage.

On the racetrack, the BMW M2 Racing delivers the same driving pleasure that is deeply rooted in the DNA of all BMW M and BMW M Motorsport vehicles. Our focus is to ensure that the BMW M2 Racing, thanks to its characteristics, is the perfect car for everyone – from a novice on a track day to an ambitious racer. And I am very pleased with the result.”\n\nStarting in 2026, private BMW M Motorsport teams will be competing with the BMW M2 Racing around the globe.

The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend. At the third round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the home round for BMW M Team WRT, the “6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps,” both BMW M Hybrid V8s once again demonstrated their potential following the podium finish in Imola (ITA). This time, however, it went unrewarded. The #20 Hypercar was in the fight for another podium finish until shortly before the end. A slow puncture set the car back before it had to retire for safety reasons due to a brake issue. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 also showed strong performance, but, after an eventful six hours, it was only enough for tenth place.\n\nWith perfect spring weather and an impressive crowd of nearly 100,000 spectators over the weekend, the stage was set for an exciting FIA WEC race. Each of the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars was driven by a duo instead of the usual trio. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) drove the #15, while René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) shared driving duties in the #20. Their teammates Dries Vanthoor (BEL) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) are competing this weekend with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nAt the start, Magnussen sprinted from 11th on the grid into the top five with the #15 before handing over to Marciello. In the eventful race that followed, with several safety car periods, the car, however, was set back by two drive-through penalties. Rast initially ran outside the top ten in the #20, but he and Frijns made steady progress thanks to a strong performance and good strategy. Frijns eventually pushed the BMW M Hybrid V8 into podium contention with bold moves. But half an hour before the end, he had to return to the pits due to brake problems, and the team decided not to send the car back out.\n\nEven though the race outcome did not meet expectations, BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team WRT gathered valuable data in preparation for the season highlight – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The endurance classic at the Sarthe will be held as the fourth round of the 2025 FIA WEC on 14th /15th June.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the crews of both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs had a difficult weekend. Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), who had narrowly missed out on victory in Imola with a second-place finish, came ninth in class with the Team WRT #46 car. The race ended early for the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO during the second hour. Following contact, damage occurred in the suspension area, and the trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS) had to retire.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “If you look at the race result alone, it’s obviously not what we had hoped for here at the home race for BMW M Team WRT. Also given the performance we showed with both BMW M Hybrid V8s, we had expected more in the end. It was frustrating that car number 15 received two penalties. That, unfortunately, set the car back, and it was difficult to fight for a top result after that. Car number 20 was very strong throughout the entire race. It was great to see that we were once again able to fight for top positions and were back on course for the podium. Unfortunately, we first had a slow puncture and then a brake issue that we still need to examine more closely. For safety reasons, we decided to retire the car. So, our conclusion is: the performance was there again, but, of course, we also want to achieve the corresponding results. In the LMGT3 class, the outcome was also not what we had hoped for after the strong race in Imola. Unfortunately, car number 31 retired early after contact. Car number 46 did a race without mistakes, but, unfortunately, the performance wasn’t enough today to fight for the front. We will continue working and are now looking forward to Le Mans. There, we want to show our full strength again and be at the very front.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A disappointing weekend overall. At some stages, it looked like we could fight for a podium, but, in the end, that wasn’t the case. Car #20 was forced to retire due to what looks like brake issues. We will investigate further. As for car #15, two drive-through penalties made it impossible to aim for a stronger result. Ferrari had the race under control, and there wasn’t much we could do to challenge them. In LMGT3, it was also a tough outcome. Car #31 retired early after being involved in an incident, which was very disappointing. With car #46, we maximised what we could with the pace we had, but it wasn't enough to fight for the podium. We took a strategic gamble, but, unfortunately, it didn’t pay off. We’ll analyse, we’ll learn, and we’ll come back stronger.”\n\nKevin Magnussen (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, 10th place): “It was unfortunate to get the two drive–through penalties. Apart from that, we had a strong start to the race. We showed a decent form, but then we were just fighting to make up from the two penalties. But it has been a good effort from the whole team. The other car also showed great performance, fighting all the way up to the top. Unfortunately there was no reward.”\n\nRobin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “I think it was an exciting race overall. The start wasn’t ideal, but we recovered well and made our way forward. Our pace was decent, even though we were not the fastest in the field, but we made smart strategy calls that kept us in the mix. On my side, there was some proper racing, with elbows out! Unfortunately, we had to retire due to a brake issue towards the end, which is a real shame as a podium was definitely within reach. But that’s racing.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 9th place LMGT3 class): “We finished P9. That reflects our potential this weekend, given the pace we had. It was still a good race overall: we fought hard in the beginning of the race, we gained positions and even battled for the podium. Unfortunately, a drive-through penalty set us back, and we took a strategic gamble to try and move up the order, knowing we couldn’t gain much on outright pace. In the end, it didn’t play out in our favour. We’ll keep pushing and hope to be more competitive next time.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF LMGT3 class): “It’s disappointing to come away with zero points. The incident with Yasser was unfortunate and not how we wanted our race to end. The team always put in so much hard work and effort and I wish we could reward them. Hopefully next time, at Le Mans, we will do just that.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend.

Apart from that, we had a strong start to the race. We showed a decent form, but then we were just fighting to make up from the two penalties. But it has been a good effort from the whole team. The other car also showed great performance, fighting all the way up to the top. Unfortunately there was no reward.”\n\nRobin Frijns (BMW M Team WRT, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “I think it was an exciting race overall. The start wasn’t ideal, but we recovered well and made our way forward. Our pace was decent, even though we were not the fastest in the field, but we made smart strategy calls that kept us in the mix. On my side, there was some proper racing, with elbows out! Unfortunately, we had to retire due to a brake issue towards the end, which is a real shame as a podium was definitely within reach. But that’s racing.”\n\nValentino Rossi (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 9th place LMGT3 class): “We finished P9. That reflects our potential this weekend, given the pace we had. It was still a good race overall: we fought hard in the beginning of the race, we gained positions and even battled for the podium. Unfortunately, a drive-through penalty set us back, and we took a strategic gamble to try and move up the order, knowing we couldn’t gain much on outright pace. In the end, it didn’t play out in our favour. We’ll keep pushing and hope to be more competitive next time.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, DNF LMGT3 class): “It’s disappointing to come away with zero points. The incident with Yasser was unfortunate and not how we wanted our race to end. The team always put in so much hard work and effort and I wish we could reward them. Hopefully next time, at Le Mans, we will do just that.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "FIA WEC in Spa: Highs and lows for BMW M Motorsport on the Ardennes rollercoaster."}]}

At the third round of the 2025 FIA WEC and the home round for BMW M Team WRT, the “6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps,” both BMW M Hybrid V8s once again demonstrated their potential following the podium finish in Imola (ITA).

The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) is known as the Ardennes rollercoaster, and BMW M Motorsport experienced an emotional rollercoaster of its own there this weekend. At the third round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the home round for BMW M Team WRT, the “6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps,” both BMW M Hybrid V8s once again demonstrated their potential following the podium finish in Imola (ITA). This time, however, it went unrewarded. The #20 Hypercar was in the fight for another podium finish until shortly before the end. A slow puncture set the car back before it had to retire for safety reasons due to a brake issue. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 also showed strong performance, but, after an eventful six hours, it was only enough for tenth place.\n\nWith perfect spring weather and an impressive crowd of nearly 100,000 spectators over the weekend, the stage was set for an exciting FIA WEC race. Each of the two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars was driven by a duo instead of the usual trio. Kevin Magnussen (DEN) and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) drove the #15, while René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) shared driving duties in the #20. Their teammates Dries Vanthoor (BEL) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) are competing this weekend with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the North American IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nAt the start, Magnussen sprinted from 11th on the grid into the top five with the #15 before handing over to Marciello. In the eventful race that followed, with several safety car periods, the car, however, was set back by two drive-through penalties. Rast initially ran outside the top ten in the #20, but he and Frijns made steady progress thanks to a strong performance and good strategy. Frijns eventually pushed the BMW M Hybrid V8 into podium contention with bold moves. But half an hour before the end, he had to return to the pits due to brake problems, and the team decided not to send the car back out.\n\nEven though the race outcome did not meet expectations, BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team WRT gathered valuable data in preparation for the season highlight – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The endurance classic at the Sarthe will be held as the fourth round of the 2025 FIA WEC on 14th /15th June.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, the crews of both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs had a difficult weekend. Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA), Valentino Rossi (ITA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA), who had narrowly missed out on victory in Imola with a second-place finish, came ninth in class with the Team WRT #46 car. The race ended early for the #31 The Bend Team WRT BMW M4 GT3 EVO during the second hour. Following contact, damage occurred in the suspension area, and the trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS) had to retire.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “If you look at the race result alone, it’s obviously not what we had hoped for here at the home race for BMW M Team WRT. Also given the performance we showed with both BMW M Hybrid V8s, we had expected more in the end. It was frustrating that car number 15 received two penalties. That, unfortunately, set the car back, and it was difficult to fight for a top result after that. Car number 20 was very strong throughout the entire race. It was great to see that we were once again able to fight for top positions and were back on course for the podium. Unfortunately, we first had a slow puncture and then a brake issue that we still need to examine more closely. For safety reasons, we decided to retire the car. So, our conclusion is: the performance was there again, but, of course, we also want to achieve the corresponding results. In the LMGT3 class, the outcome was also not what we had hoped for after the strong race in Imola. Unfortunately, car number 31 retired early after contact. Car number 46 did a race without mistakes, but, unfortunately, the performance wasn’t enough today to fight for the front. We will continue working and are now looking forward to Le Mans. There, we want to show our full strength again and be at the very front.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “A disappointing weekend overall. At some stages, it looked like we could fight for a podium, but, in the end, that wasn’t the case. Car #20 was forced to retire due to what looks like brake issues. We will investigate further. As for car #15, two drive-through penalties made it impossible to aim for a stronger result. Ferrari had the race under control, and there wasn’t much we could do to challenge them. In LMGT3, it was also a tough outcome. Car #31 retired early after being involved in an incident, which was very disappointing.

Tomorrow, the new fine-dining restaurant at BMW Welt will welcome its first customers. Since the start of the year, head chef Jens Madsen – who follows in the footsteps of Bobby Bräuer in the exclusive surroundings of BMW Welt – has been working together with BMW Group Designworks, the BMW Group's innovation studio, on a unique new concept: THE CLOUD by Käfer. Here, Madsen, restaurant manager Mona Röthig, sommelier Luigi Pecchia and their team will introduce guests to the “CULINARY NOMADISM” vision successfully trialled at a pop-up event in April.\n\nThe restaurant’s opening season will explore the theme “NOMADIC EARTH”, as Madsen escorts his guests on a culinary voyage.\n\n“With Nomadic Earth, we are writing the first chapter in our new travelogue. We want to offer our guests a special experience of elite-level cuisine that expands their horizons and blends aromas and textures from around the world with the finest produce from our local region – with surprising yet cohesive results. In Jens Madsen, Mona Röthig and Luigi Pecchia, we have assembled a team who are turning this ambitious vision into masterful reality with exceptional skill and passion,” explains Michael Käfer.\n\n“To bring Käfer’s vision to life, Designworks developed the spatial concept and storytelling for THE CLOUD. Materials, forms, and details come together to create an atmosphere that is sensual, full of contrast, and emotionally engaging. In this way, the design becomes an integral part of the overall culinary experience,” says Anders Warming, Head of BMW Group Designworks.\n\n“With THE CLOUD by Käfer, we are adding a new dimension to the BMW Welt experience. In addition to vehicle handovers, we can now also offer our guests an inspirational culinary journey in a unique setting created by BMW Group Designworks Munich. Here, in the upper reaches of BMW Welt on its third level, guests enjoy an impressive view over the inside of the building, while immersed in a fine-dining experience,” adds Sandra Wittemer, Head of BMW Welt.\n\nThe experts at BMW Group Designworks and Käfer have worked together closely since 2023 to create a space for all the senses and make a visit to THE CLOUD by Käfer truly unforgettable. Light, music, visual and haptic features flow into one another; every light and every piece of furniture contributes to the experience as a whole. For the execution of the project, BMW Group Designworks collaborated with renowned partners including architectural and design studio hildmannwilke, German lighting design brand Occhio, the artist Oscar Zabala – known for his generative audio-visual performances and installations – and innovative Swiss fabric manufacturer Jakob Schlaepfer, supplier to haute couture fashion houses around the world.\n\nThe eight-course menu with complementary side dishes brings regional produce – such as goat’s milk from Lenggries, char from Kinsau and venison from the Poltinger Forest – together with dukkah, black pepper soup and pearl emmer pilaf. And the milk-fed veal brochette is inspired by snacks typically served with a beer in African bars. Jens Madsen takes prime cut of veal, skewered on a spike, and serves it with tiger nut, chapati and habanero pepper.\n\nThe philosophy behind Madsen’s cuisine is very much his own and is rooted in movement, memory and origin. This new concept new brings together culinary traditions, skills and spices from around the world with top-quality local produce to create highly distinctive cuisine. In Season 1 at THE CLOUD by Käfer, this features aromas and ingredients from eastern and southern Africa, combined with the delicacies and rhythm of Bavaria. Each course reflects a particular stop on a culinary journey, in some cases inspired by faraway shores, at other times recalling pastures closer to home. It all goes into making cuisine that exudes a curiosity for global influences yet embraces its local roots, appealing to the senses, sparking wonder and surprise, and staying open to new perspectives.\n\nElegant and inviting, with a technically refined aesthetic, the restaurant displays clear references to the design language of BMW. After ascending to the third level of the “floating” structure conceived by COOP Himmelb(l)au, the guests embark on their journey after leaving the elevator. Arriving on Moon Island, they can take a moment to tune into the feel of the evening. They are greeted in understated style by a digital artwork featuring a quarter moon, which gradually morphs from the golden hour through soft twilight to the deep blue tones of the night.\n\nAt the Biophilic Bar, made from Perlino marble, artistically presented ingredients from the menu arouse the guests’ curiosity about the dining to come as they enjoy an aperitif. They then move on to the Slim Bar, where a personalised cocktail will be served – and where they can also round off their journey later on with a concluding drink. Here, the golden hour transitions into the blue hour. The guests then move on through the Chef’s Atelier, decorated with travel photos and exotic examples of kitchenware, until they finally reach the Dining Cloud, taking their seats at tables with panoramic views over BMW Welt. Floating over the centre of this space is the amorphous cloud-like installation from which it takes its name. Made from a transparent, featherweight fabric material, and brought to weightless, constantly changing life by a projection, it reprises both the golden colour of sunset and the deep blue of midnight.\n\nBetween the kitchen and the Dining Cloud stands a five-ton monolith made of titanium stone.

Tomorrow, the new fine-dining restaurant at BMW Welt will welcome its first customers. Since the start of the year, head chef Jens Madsen – who follows in the footsteps of Bobby Bräuer in the exclusive surroundings of BMW Welt – has been working together with BMW Group Designworks, the BMW Group's innovation studio, on a unique new concept: THE CLOUD by Käfer. Here, Madsen, restaurant manager Mona Röthig, sommelier Luigi Pecchia and their team will introduce guests to the “CULINARY NOMADISM” vision successfully trialled at a pop-up event in April.\n\nThe restaurant’s opening season will explore the theme “NOMADIC EARTH”, as Madsen escorts his guests on a culinary voyage.\n\n“With Nomadic Earth, we are writing the first chapter in our new travelogue. We want to offer our guests a special experience of elite-level cuisine that expands their horizons and blends aromas and textures from around the world with the finest produce from our local region – with surprising yet cohesive results. In Jens Madsen, Mona Röthig and Luigi Pecchia, we have assembled a team who are turning this ambitious vision into masterful reality with exceptional skill and passion,” explains Michael Käfer.\n\n“To bring Käfer’s vision to life, Designworks developed the spatial concept and storytelling for THE CLOUD. Materials, forms, and details come together to create an atmosphere that is sensual, full of contrast, and emotionally engaging. In this way, the design becomes an integral part of the overall culinary experience,” says Anders Warming, Head of BMW Group Designworks.\n\n“With THE CLOUD by Käfer, we are adding a new dimension to the BMW Welt experience. In addition to vehicle handovers, we can now also offer our guests an inspirational culinary journey in a unique setting created by BMW Group Designworks Munich. Here, in the upper reaches of BMW Welt on its third level, guests enjoy an impressive view over the inside of the building, while immersed in a fine-dining experience,” adds Sandra Wittemer, Head of BMW Welt.\n\nThe experts at BMW Group Designworks and Käfer have worked together closely since 2023 to create a space for all the senses and make a visit to THE CLOUD by Käfer truly unforgettable. Light, music, visual and haptic features flow into one another; every light and every piece of furniture contributes to the experience as a whole. For the execution of the project, BMW Group Designworks collaborated with renowned partners including architectural and design studio hildmannwilke, German lighting design brand Occhio, the artist Oscar Zabala – known for his generative audio-visual performances and installations – and innovative Swiss fabric manufacturer Jakob Schlaepfer, supplier to haute couture fashion houses around the world.\n\nThe eight-course menu with complementary side dishes brings regional produce – such as goat’s milk from Lenggries, char from Kinsau and venison from the Poltinger Forest – together with dukkah, black pepper soup and pearl emmer pilaf. And the milk-fed veal brochette is inspired by snacks typically served with a beer in African bars. Jens Madsen takes prime cut of veal, skewered on a spike, and serves it with tiger nut, chapati and habanero pepper.\n\nThe philosophy behind Madsen’s cuisine is very much his own and is rooted in movement, memory and origin. This new concept new brings together culinary traditions, skills and spices from around the world with top-quality local produce to create highly distinctive cuisine. In Season 1 at THE CLOUD by Käfer, this features aromas and ingredients from eastern and southern Africa, combined with the delicacies and rhythm of Bavaria. Each course reflects a particular stop on a culinary journey, in some cases inspired by faraway shores, at other times recalling pastures closer to home. It all goes into making cuisine that exudes a curiosity for global influences yet embraces its local roots, appealing to the senses, sparking wonder and surprise, and staying open to new perspectives.\n\nElegant and inviting, with a technically refined aesthetic, the restaurant displays clear references to the design language of BMW. After ascending to the third level of the “floating” structure conceived by COOP Himmelb(l)au, the guests embark on their journey after leaving the elevator. Arriving on Moon Island, they can take a moment to tune into the feel of the evening. They are greeted in understated style by a digital artwork featuring a quarter moon, which gradually morphs from the golden hour through soft twilight to the deep blue tones of the night.\n\nAt the Biophilic Bar, made from Perlino marble, artistically presented ingredients from the menu arouse the guests’ curiosity about the dining to come as they enjoy an aperitif. They then move on to the Slim Bar, where a personalised cocktail will be served – and where they can also round off their journey later on with a concluding drink. Here, the golden hour transitions into the blue hour. The guests then move on through the Chef’s Atelier, decorated with travel photos and exotic examples of kitchenware, until they finally reach the Dining Cloud, taking their seats at tables with panoramic views over BMW Welt. Floating over the centre of this space is the amorphous cloud-like installation from which it takes its name. Made from a transparent, featherweight fabric material, and brought to weightless, constantly changing life by a projection, it reprises both the golden colour of sunset and the deep blue of midnight.\n\nBetween the kitchen and the Dining Cloud stands a five-ton monolith made of titanium stone.

The Neue Klasse will usher in a new era of fully electric driving at the BMW Group – the success of which will depend heavily on the production of powerful high-voltage batteries. That’s why the BMW Group is expanding its production network for the next generation of high-voltage batteries significantly. “We are setting up five facilities on three continents to produce our sixth-generation high-voltage batteries,” explained Milan Nedeljković, Board Member for Production at BMW AG. Across the globe, the principle of “local for local” will apply: \"Close connection of battery production with vehicle production is part of our strategy,\" explains Markus Fallböhmer, Senior Vice President of Battery Production at BMW AG. This helps the BMW Group increase the resilience of its production.\n\nBattery and vehicle production closely connected\n\nThe Neue Klasse will be the first to incorporate the all-new cylindrical cells. These represent a technological leap by the BMW Group, offering vastly improved energy density, charging times and range. They will be assembled in new facilities located as closely as possible to vehicle plants, in keeping with the principle of “local for local”. State-of-the-art assembly plants for sixth-generation high-voltage batteries are currently under construction in Irlbach-Strasskirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Woodruff (near Plant Spartanburg in the US), Shenyang (China) and San Luis Potosí, Mexico. With the “local for local” approach in place, production will be able to continue even when unexpected political or economic events occur. In addition, short distances between battery and vehicle plants will reduce the carbon footprint of car production. The BMW Group is also upgrading its existing sites and therefore securing and creating jobs.\n\nNeue Klasse to launch first at Plant Debrecen in 2025\n\nThe first Neue Klasse vehicles will be produced at the BMW Group’s new plant in Debrecen, starting in 2025. High-voltage battery and vehicle manufacturing will launch in parallel. With the training centre in Debrecen open since autumn 2023 and the communications centre in use since February 2024, a large number of employees are already at work in their offices at the site. The production team, meanwhile, are preparing for their new jobs at various locations across the BMW Group production network. This will ensure a smooth start to pre-series production and a successful series launch in the second half of 2025. Currently, the final buildings are being completed. They will be handed over to the technologies by the end of the year.\n\nHigh-voltage batteries from Lower Bavaria\n\nThe BMW Group is also going to manufacture high-voltage batteries for Neue Klasse models in Germany – specifically in Irlbach-Straßkirchen, in Lower Bavaria. The new facility will supply sixth-generation high-voltage batteries to German car plants. The BMW Group was granted permission to build the new high-voltage battery assembly plant in April 2024 and erected the first of pillar for the production hall in late June 2024. The production building is scheduled to be enclosed with facade and roof by the end of the year. The citizens of Straßkirchen had previously voted in favour of the BMW Group coming to their area, with a clear majority in the referendum of September 2023.\n\nChina to produce the Neue Klasse from 2026\n\nFrom 2026 Neue Klasse vehicles will also be made by BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) in Shenyang, China. Here, too, the sixth-generation high-voltage batteries required for the cars will be manufactured locally. The production hall was completed in November 2023 after a construction time of only 21 months. The installation of plant and machinery has been underway since March 2024. Preparing for the launch of the Neue Klasse, the BMW Group has also set up its largest R&D network outside Germany, with facilities in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and Nanjing.\n\nNeue Klasse in Mexico from 2027\n\nAt San Luis Potosí in Mexico, additional production capacity is being established for series production of the Neue Klasse to start in 2027. Construction of the new high-voltage battery assembly plant started in May 2024 and will comprise more than 80,000 square metres of production space when completed. But the integration of battery assembly is not all that’s changing at Plant San Luis Potosí: the bodyshop is set to grow to more than 90,000 square metres in total, while vehicle assembly and logistics spaces will expand by nearly 10,000 square metres. The BMW Group is the first premium OEM to manufacture fully electric cars and high-voltage batteries in Mexico – and a pioneer in the industry. Additionally, the company plans to expand the photovoltaic systems within the plant and thus double the power generated from photovoltaics. This is intended to generate more than 20 percent of the current electricity demand directly on the plant premises in the future.\n\nBMW Group Plant Woodruff: High-voltage batteries for Spartanburg\n\nElectromobility is also advancing in South Carolina. BMW Group Plant Woodruff will cover an area of about 93 hectares and consist of a technology building, ancillary structures, an energy centre, a staff restaurant, a fire department and a Talent Campus. It will create more than 300 new jobs with the BMW Group. When construction reaches completion in 2026, Woodruff will assemble high-voltage batteries for fully electric cars made in nearby Plant Spartanburg. The ground-breaking ceremony for the first building in Woodruff – the training centre – was in June 2023.\n\nBattery expertise concentrated in Parsdorf and Munich\n\nPrototype battery cells like the ones in the Neue Klasse, launching in 2025, are already being made at the BMW Group’s Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf, just east of Munich. The CMCC was built to complement the Battery Cell Competence Centre (BCCC) in the north of the city, where development work is carried out. The CMCC scales up the best product for series production. Product and process are uniquely interlinked by the close collaboration across divisions, between Development, Purchasing and Production. The BMW Group operates further pre-series plants and pilot lines for future high-voltage batteries in Munich and the nearby towns of Parsdorf and Hallbergmoos."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Worldwide five new assembly sites for 6th generation high-voltage batteries +++ Current status from Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Germany), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA) +++"}]}

The Neue Klasse will usher in a new era of fully electric driving at the BMW Group – the success of which will depend heavily on the production of powerful high-voltage batteries. That’s why the BMW Group is expanding its production network for the next generation of high-voltage batteries significantly. “We are setting up five facilities on three continents to produce our sixth-generation high-voltage batteries,” explained Milan Nedeljković, Board Member for Production at BMW AG. Across the globe, the principle of “local for local” will apply: \"Close connection of battery production with vehicle production is part of our strategy,\" explains Markus Fallböhmer, Senior Vice President of Battery Production at BMW AG. This helps the BMW Group increase the resilience of its production.\n\nBattery and vehicle production closely connected\n\nThe Neue Klasse will be the first to incorporate the all-new cylindrical cells. These represent a technological leap by the BMW Group, offering vastly improved energy density, charging times and range. They will be assembled in new facilities located as closely as possible to vehicle plants, in keeping with the principle of “local for local”. State-of-the-art assembly plants for sixth-generation high-voltage batteries are currently under construction in Irlbach-Strasskirchen (Lower Bavaria), Debrecen (Hungary), Woodruff (near Plant Spartanburg in the US), Shenyang (China) and San Luis Potosí, Mexico. With the “local for local” approach in place, production will be able to continue even when unexpected political or economic events occur. In addition, short distances between battery and vehicle plants will reduce the carbon footprint of car production. The BMW Group is also upgrading its existing sites and therefore securing and creating jobs.\n\nNeue Klasse to launch first at Plant Debrecen in 2025\n\nThe first Neue Klasse vehicles will be produced at the BMW Group’s new plant in Debrecen, starting in 2025. High-voltage battery and vehicle manufacturing will launch in parallel. With the training centre in Debrecen open since autumn 2023 and the communications centre in use since February 2024, a large number of employees are already at work in their offices at the site. The production team, meanwhile, are preparing for their new jobs at various locations across the BMW Group production network. This will ensure a smooth start to pre-series production and a successful series launch in the second half of 2025. Currently, the final buildings are being completed. They will be handed over to the technologies by the end of the year.\n\nHigh-voltage batteries from Lower Bavaria\n\nThe BMW Group is also going to manufacture high-voltage batteries for Neue Klasse models in Germany – specifically in Irlbach-Straßkirchen, in Lower Bavaria. The new facility will supply sixth-generation high-voltage batteries to German car plants. The BMW Group was granted permission to build the new high-voltage battery assembly plant in April 2024 and erected the first of pillar for the production hall in late June 2024. The production building is scheduled to be enclosed with facade and roof by the end of the year. The citizens of Straßkirchen had previously voted in favour of the BMW Group coming to their area, with a clear majority in the referendum of September 2023.\n\nChina to produce the Neue Klasse from 2026\n\nFrom 2026 Neue Klasse vehicles will also be made by BMW Brilliance Automotive (BBA) in Shenyang, China. Here, too, the sixth-generation high-voltage batteries required for the cars will be manufactured locally. The production hall was completed in November 2023 after a construction time of only 21 months. The installation of plant and machinery has been underway since March 2024. Preparing for the launch of the Neue Klasse, the BMW Group has also set up its largest R&D network outside Germany, with facilities in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and Nanjing.\n\nNeue Klasse in Mexico from 2027\n\nAt San Luis Potosí in Mexico, additional production capacity is being established for series production of the Neue Klasse to start in 2027. Construction of the new high-voltage battery assembly plant started in May 2024 and will comprise more than 80,000 square metres of production space when completed. But the integration of battery assembly is not all that’s changing at Plant San Luis Potosí: the bodyshop is set to grow to more than 90,000 square metres in total, while vehicle assembly and logistics spaces will expand by nearly 10,000 square metres. The BMW Group is the first premium OEM to manufacture fully electric cars and high-voltage batteries in Mexico – and a pioneer in the industry.

BMW M Motorsport celebrated another success at the FIA GT World Cup in the narrow street canyons of Macau (CHN): Raffaele Marciello (SUI) claimed second place on the podium in the #53 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of ROWE Racing. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) delivered a strong comeback drive in the Team WRT #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, sporting its special Shell livery. His charge brought him up to sixth place in Sunday’s main race. The FIA GT World Cup, held as part of the legendary Macau Grand Prix on the Guia Circuit, traditionally marks the spectacular finale of the GT3 racing season.\n\nAfter Friday’s qualifying session came the 12-lap qualification race on Saturday, followed by the 16-lap main race on Sunday. Marciello secured fifth place in qualifying. Van der Linde was unlucky as after making contact with the track barrier he was unable to set a timed lap and had to start the qualification race from the back of the grid. In Saturday’s sprint race, which determined the starting positions for Sunday, both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs moved forward. Marciello finished fourth, while van der Linde improved to 13th and was then promoted to 12th after a competitor received a penalty.\n\nIn the main race, Marciello seized his chance immediately at the start and sprinted up to second place – a podium position he held until the finish line. Van der Linde gained several positions in the turbulent opening stage and later executed a brilliant overtaking manoeuvre on the tight street circuit to take sixth place. The winner of the main race was Antonio Fuoco (ITA / Ferrari), who had already taken pole position and won the qualification race.\n\nReactions after FIA GT World Cup in Macau:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The second place in Macau this year was a great performance by Raffaele. Gaining positions right at the start was the key to the podium after starting from fourth. Congratulations to Ferrari; I think we were simply missing the pace to keep up with Antonio Fuoco. Given that, we are happy with second place. For Sheldon, it was unfortunate that he couldn’t set a time in Friday’s qualifying. We all know that qualifying is crucial here on this narrow street circuit in Macau. Nevertheless, he gave a great performance and worked his way from the very back to sixth place in the main race over the course of the weekend.

Now we wrap up the season and focus fully on the new year.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (ROWE Racing, #53 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place main race, 4th place qualification race ): “Our qualifying was not the best, for sure. When you start from fifth it’s always difficult to fight your way to the front. But we had a good first sector and in the main race, there was the opportunity to overtake at the start. But in the end we also need to admit that the Ferrari was too quick. I tried my best and second place was the maximum I could do today.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 6th place main race, 12th place qualification race ): “Unfortunately it has not been the weekend we came here for. We obviously wanted to try to win the race, that was my main goal coming into the weekend. But it started off on the wrong foot in qualifying with a mistake that I take responsibility for. We had to start at the back of the field in the qualifying race, had a very good start but then unfortunately got spun around in turn three. So that was another rollercoaster we had to go through.

The Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 will be awarded to Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. The prize honours one of the most influential contemporary artists, who will be represented in Germany for the first time with a solo exhibition. His works, which range from sculpture and installation to conceptual practice, are characterised by sharp humour, bitter seriousness, and a profound reflection on social structures. Since its launch in 2000, this prestigious award has recognised artistic positions that have had a decisive influence on contemporary art and presented them to a broad public in Berlin. BMW has been the exclusive partner of this unique initiative since 2006. The exhibition accompanying the Preis der Nationalgalerie will open at the Neue Nationalgalerie during Berlin Art Week in September 2026.\n\n“Back in 2016, Maurizio Cattelan gave a fully electric BMW i3 a spaghetti-themed wrap as part of our partnership with ‘Rencontres d’Arles’. Creative freedom has defined BMW’s cultural engagement for over 50 years, through hundreds of collaborations across the globe. And it is precisely this freedom that Cattelan continues to explore to its fullest – with wit, intelligence, and often a sharp critical edge. Whether art reflects our existence or opens up new perspectives has been discussed since the Romantic era. In Cattelan’s case, it is always both. Social relevance and creative excellence come together here, just as they do with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, which BMW has supported for two decades. We congratulate Maurizio Cattelan on being awarded the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie and on his upcoming solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate.\n\nBMW and Maurizio Cattelan collaborated at “Rencontres d’Arles” in 2016; together with photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, Cattelan created a special project based around the fully electric BMW i3. The so-called “Spaghetti Car” featured the vehicle completely covered in spaghetti-themed foil – a humorous and conceptual work that playfully addressed issues of art, consumption, and sustainability.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Maurizio Cattelan (born 1960 in Padua) has been one of the defining voices in international art. His iconic works – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin, where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.\n\nThe expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie were also eligible to submit nominations.\n\nEmma Lavigne, Sam Keller, Klaus Biesenbach say: „Nearly two decades ago, as co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.\n\nCattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion, death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.\n\nIn Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being re-examined – between the last generations with direct connections to the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives – Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures, oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and open new vantage points on contemporary social debates. In a time of increasing political polarisation, his art can encourage us to view remembrance not as compulsion or obligation, but as a vital and relevant engagement with the present and the future.\n\nCattelan’s ironic questioning of authority and “truth” carries particular urgency today. At a moment when institutions – museums, politics and the media – are re-evaluating their credibility and social roles, he scrutinizes structures of power both within and beyond the art world, always without a moralizing tone. His works provoke reflection on personal responsibility, historical representation and the limits of institutional critique and authority. In an atmosphere of political and social hardening, Cattelan’s subversive humour acts as a liberating force. He reminds us that provocation and wit are not expressions of cynicism but forms of resistance and constructive reflection. Particularly in the German context, where public discourse often carries a strong moral charge, his art opens up spaces for thought beyond outrage and polarization. Cattelan is not an artist of straightforwardness. His strength lies in embracing ambiguity, exposing contradictions and posing new questions. This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a precondition for critical awareness.\n\nThe Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the 20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”\n\nChristian Kohorst, Chairman of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie, says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of international significance to Berlin.”\n\nMaurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context. In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition. The change of location places contemporary art in dialogue with the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie and its history. The iconic hall of the Mies van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a concise, artistic setting. The exhibition is made possible by the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie.\n\nFurther information on the Preis der Nationalgalerie and its comprehensive history can be found at preis.freunde-der-nationalgalerie.de.\n\nMaurizio Cattelan, 2025:BEING AN ARTIST IS NOT A JOB, IT'S A MALFUNCTIONART IS A WAY TO SURVIVE, NOT A WAY TO LIVEIF I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED ALONGTIME AGOSOMETIMES THE BEST IDEA IS THE ONE YOU'RE TOOASHAMEDTO SAY OUT LOUDFAILURE IS MY FAVORITE COLORI DON'T MAKE ART TO COMMUNICATE, I MAKE IT TO ESCAPEIF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING SERIOUS, WEAR A CLOWN'SNOSEI DON'T BELIEVE IN INSPIRATION, I BELIEVE IN GOOD TIMING ANDBETTER EXCUSESYOU DON'T MAKE A MASTERPIECE, YOU SURVIVE ONEBEAUTY IS THE PERFECT ALIBIMY GOAL IS TO VANISH COMPLETELY, LEAVING BEHIND JUST AQUESTION MARKAS LONG AS YOU DON'T CHOOSE, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLEBEING ORIGINAL IS OVERRATED, BEING PRECISE IS TERRIFYINGGUILT IS ONE OF THE PUREST MATERIALS AN ARTIST CAN USESOMETIMES I WISH I COULD COPYRIGHT SILENCEIF I BELIEVED IN MESSAGES, I'D WORK IN ADVERTISINGI DON'T CREATE MEANING, I OFFER TRAPS FOR ITTRUTH IS NOT AN INGREDIENT, IT'S THE AFTERTASTEEVERY ARTWORK IS A LOOPHOLEYOU KNOW IT'S WORKING WHEN YOU START REGRETTING ITIF I WANTED COMFORT, I'D BUY FURNITURETHE BEST ARTWORKS ARE MISTAKES NO ONE DARED TO FIXA GOOD WORK DOESN'T ASK FOR ATTENTION, IT STEALS ITA BANANA ON A WALL IS STILL MORE HONEST THAN MOSTPEOPLE I'VE METTHE MORE YOU POLISH AN IDEA, THE LESS IT CUTSIF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, IT WASN'T ARTCONCEPTUAL ART?

His iconic works – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin, where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.\n\nThe expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie were also eligible to submit nominations.\n\nEmma Lavigne, Sam Keller, Klaus Biesenbach say: „Nearly two decades ago, as co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.\n\nCattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion, death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.\n\nIn Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being re-examined – between the last generations with direct connections to the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives – Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures, oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and open new vantage points on contemporary social debates. In a time of increasing political polarisation, his art can encourage us to view remembrance not as compulsion or obligation, but as a vital and relevant engagement with the present and the future.\n\nCattelan’s ironic questioning of authority and “truth” carries particular urgency today. At a moment when institutions – museums, politics and the media – are re-evaluating their credibility and social roles, he scrutinizes structures of power both within and beyond the art world, always without a moralizing tone. His works provoke reflection on personal responsibility, historical representation and the limits of institutional critique and authority. In an atmosphere of political and social hardening, Cattelan’s subversive humour acts as a liberating force. He reminds us that provocation and wit are not expressions of cynicism but forms of resistance and constructive reflection. Particularly in the German context, where public discourse often carries a strong moral charge, his art opens up spaces for thought beyond outrage and polarization. Cattelan is not an artist of straightforwardness. His strength lies in embracing ambiguity, exposing contradictions and posing new questions. This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a precondition for critical awareness.\n\nThe Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the 20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”\n\nChristian Kohorst, Chairman of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie, says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of international significance to Berlin.”\n\nMaurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context. In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition. The change of location places contemporary art in dialogue with the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie and its history. The iconic hall of the Mies van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a concise, artistic setting. The exhibition is made possible by the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie.\n\nFurther information on the Preis der Nationalgalerie and its comprehensive history can be found at preis.freunde-der-nationalgalerie.de.\n\nMaurizio Cattelan, 2025:BEING AN ARTIST IS NOT A JOB, IT'S A MALFUNCTIONART IS A WAY TO SURVIVE, NOT A WAY TO LIVEIF I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED ALONGTIME AGOSOMETIMES THE BEST IDEA IS THE ONE YOU'RE TOOASHAMEDTO SAY OUT LOUDFAILURE IS MY FAVORITE COLORI DON'T MAKE ART TO COMMUNICATE, I MAKE IT TO ESCAPEIF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING SERIOUS, WEAR A CLOWN'SNOSEI DON'T BELIEVE IN INSPIRATION, I BELIEVE IN GOOD TIMING ANDBETTER EXCUSESYOU DON'T MAKE A MASTERPIECE, YOU SURVIVE ONEBEAUTY IS THE PERFECT ALIBIMY GOAL IS TO VANISH COMPLETELY, LEAVING BEHIND JUST AQUESTION MARKAS LONG AS YOU DON'T CHOOSE, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLEBEING ORIGINAL IS OVERRATED, BEING PRECISE IS TERRIFYINGGUILT IS ONE OF THE PUREST MATERIALS AN ARTIST CAN USESOMETIMES I WISH I COULD COPYRIGHT SILENCEIF I BELIEVED IN MESSAGES, I'D WORK IN ADVERTISINGI DON'T CREATE MEANING, I OFFER TRAPS FOR ITTRUTH IS NOT AN INGREDIENT, IT'S THE AFTERTASTEEVERY ARTWORK IS A LOOPHOLEYOU KNOW IT'S WORKING WHEN YOU START REGRETTING ITIF I WANTED COMFORT, I'D BUY FURNITURETHE BEST ARTWORKS ARE MISTAKES NO ONE DARED TO FIXA GOOD WORK DOESN'T ASK FOR ATTENTION, IT STEALS ITA BANANA ON A WALL IS STILL MORE HONEST THAN MOSTPEOPLE I'VE METTHE MORE YOU POLISH AN IDEA, THE LESS IT CUTSIF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, IT WASN'T ARTCONCEPTUAL ART?

Following the successful launch of the program, anticipation is already high for the “Class of 2026.”\n\nTo conclude their BMW M Racing Academy year, the four members of the “Class of 2025” spent a full week immersed in the world of BMW M Motorsport. At BMW’s headquarters in Munich (GER), Besler, Martí, Million, and Tröger enjoyed a guided tour of BMW Welt and the BMW Museum. They then participated in workshops on social media and brand building – and immediately put their new skills to the test: the group documented their joint road trip to Viareggio (ITA) in a BMW M5 for BMW M Motorsport’s official Instagram channel.\n\nIn Viareggio, the quartet once again trained with Formula Medicine – as they had at the beginning of the year – focusing on both their mental and physical performance. Under the professional supervision of Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his globally renowned team, the participants assessed their progress since the program’s start and evaluated their development. The “Class of 2025” also completed a 24-hour race simulation together, gaining firsthand experience of the procedures, challenges, and demands of endurance racing.\n\nThroughout the year, the four drivers accumulated many valuable test kilometers on real racetracks. In Miramas (FRA) and Varano (ITA), they worked side by side with BMW M works drivers on development testing for the new BMW M2 Racing. Martí and Besler also gained insights into BMW M Motorsport’s factory programs by attending the FIA WEC weekend in Imola (ITA), where they met Head of BMW M Motorsport, Andreas Roos and several works drivers. Meanwhile, Million joined BMW M Motorsport at the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship round in Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nThe participants were mentored throughout the year by a trio of BMW M works drivers. Jens Klingmann (GER) served as the main point of contact for the “Class of 2025,” supported by Max Hesse (GER) and Robby Foley (USA). The team was completed by Dirk Adorf (GER), who brought his extensive experience from previous talent development programs. Together, they provided expert guidance both on and off the track, offering invaluable advice, analysis, and feedback. Their presence at the participants’ GT4 customer racing events provided an especially valuable learning opportunity through direct, hands-on coaching.\n\nBesler, Martí, Tröger, and Million had earned their places in the Academy after a demanding selection process against a strong field of GT4 drivers last year. The selection for the second generation is already underway – and following the program’s successful debut, everyone involved is eagerly looking forward to the “Class of 2026.”\n\nStatements on the BMW M Racing Academy.\n\nBjörn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: “I’m extremely proud that we were able to establish this development program again this year. Supporting talent from the customer racing sector is something both BMW M Motorsport and I personally care deeply about. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, the four participants made important contributions to development work, benefitting everyone involved. It was fascinating to watch how our ‘Class of 2025’ evolved both on and off the track. My thanks go to our BMW M works drivers Jens, Max, and Robby for their intense and constructive mentoring, which makes this program so special. We’re all very eager to continue following the progress of Berkay, Nerea, Matt, and Niels. After such a strong debut year, I’m very excited to see what the next generation of the BMW M Racing Academy will bring in 2026.”\n\nJens Klingmann, BMW M works driver: “It was great that, in the second half of the year, we were able to dive deep into the DNA of BMW – the values, the core business, the history, and the future – to broaden the participants’ understanding as drivers and give them a bigger-picture view. At the start of the program, we worked with Formula Medicine to assess each participant’s physical and mental baseline, and from there we built personalized training plans. Seeing their progress over the year was very rewarding. The 24-hour simulation was also crucial for teaching how to approach such an event, manage rest periods, and recover both mentally and physically. For drivers without prior endurance experience, that’s a real eye-opener. Overall, my impression is extremely positive. It was a lot of fun, and we were able to give the participants behind-the-scenes insights that money can’t buy. I’m happy that we could always be there for them – whether analyzing onboard footage, answering questions, or sharing advice. I wish all four of them the very best and hope they can apply everything they’ve learned in the BMW M Racing Academy to their future careers, both on and off the track.”\n\nBerkay Besler, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “Racing for a brand like BMW is already something very special to me, but being part of the BMW family through the Academy made it even more meaningful. Having such close contact with all members of this big organization was incredibly valuable. The relationship with the three mentors was essential – especially since I’ve known Max for a long time and could exchange ideas with him throughout the year. I also spent a lot of time with Jens during the BMW M2 Racing tests, and his influence on my performance has been huge. After every test, we wrote reports to share with him, and after every race, I did race reports with my engineer – something I had never done before. It really helps us improve and analyze our weaknesses. I’ve also adapted my nutrition and training routines based on what I learned at Formula Medicine and use mental techniques during races to enhance my focus. All these experiences will be crucial for my future racing career.”\n\nNerea Martí, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy provided me with a complete preparation both on and off the track. I’m very grateful for the close connection to BMW and the opportunity to learn from everyone involved. I’ve learned to pay attention to small details and to plan my development strategically – from physical and mental preparation to communication and social media presence. The program has taught me how to prepare properly off the track, apply the right training methods, and balance physical and mental aspects to deliver my best performance. The chance to interact with our mentors and everyone involved in the program was incredibly valuable. Their experience, advice, and feedback had a big impact on my growth as a driver, and I’m confident that their guidance will continue to help me in the future.”\n\nMatt Million, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “My key takeaways fall into three categories: professionalism, performance, and in-depth knowledge of BMW M and BMW M Motorsport. The mentors in particular gave me a clear understanding of how to act as a BMW M driver and brand ambassador, both on and off the track. The conversations with Robby Foley and Max Hesse helped me build a framework for planning my next career steps. Overall, the program elevated me in every aspect as a driver and ambassador – from physical and mental training to recovery and team feedback. I’ve also started using media and interview opportunities much more effectively to represent myself and the brand. Sharing my story from the BMW M Racing Academy and my journey feels special. Representing the brand I raced with for years in club racing is personally a magical story for me.”\n\nNiels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy has given me insights into professional motorsport that you wouldn’t normally get. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, I gained my first experience in race car development, and working directly with the engineers was unique and highly educational. With the help of our mentors, especially Jens, I’ve learned how to give precise feedback to my race engineer. Thanks to our Formula Medicine training, I now prepare for races in a completely different way and can perform much better. All these important experiences have helped me develop further as a driver. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy has made me a more complete racer.”\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Sedan: energy consumption weighted combined: 17,6–17,2 kWh/100 km and 5–4,8 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 114–108 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B.

I’ve also started using media and interview opportunities much more effectively to represent myself and the brand. Sharing my story from the BMW M Racing Academy and my journey feels special. Representing the brand I raced with for years in club racing is personally a magical story for me.”\n\nNiels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy has given me insights into professional motorsport that you wouldn’t normally get. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, I gained my first experience in race car development, and working directly with the engineers was unique and highly educational. With the help of our mentors, especially Jens, I’ve learned how to give precise feedback to my race engineer. Thanks to our Formula Medicine training, I now prepare for races in a completely different way and can perform much better. All these important experiences have helped me develop further as a driver. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy has made me a more complete racer.”\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Sedan: energy consumption weighted combined: 17,6–17,2 kWh/100 km and 5–4,8 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 114–108 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B.

BMW Group Plant Debrecen is taking shape: The state-of-the-art paint shop is the first technology to be commissioned at the new production location in Hungary. Through the use of various new processes and systems, such as power-to-heat, Heat Grid and eRTO, the Debrecen facility will become the first paint shop in the BMW Group’s global production network to operate entirely without fossil fuels. The new site in Debrecen, where pre-series production of the Neue Klasse will ramp up at the end of the year, provides a blueprint for all future plants based on the principles of the BMW iFACTORY.\n\nThe new paint shop in Debrecen is designed to paint 30 vehicle bodies per hour in a fully automated painting process. This capacity can be increased significantly at a later date. The installation will be enabled using BMW iX1 bodies. The cutting-edge system was developed and planned by leveraging existing expertise within the production network. With a footprint of 33,000 square metres, the three-story paint shop building provides ample workspace for modern production.\n\nPower-to-heat significantly reduces carbon footprint\n\nThe power-to-heat principle is essential to operating the Debrecen paint shop without fossil fuels like natural gas. All ovens and other processes necessary for painting will run entirely on electricity, rather than natural gas, as was the case in the past. This principle significantly reduces the paint shop's carbon footprint, even if power consumption will increase, due to running without natural gas. In Debrecen, we obtain the external power required for production exclusively from renewable energy sources.\n\nHeat Grid achieves another ten percent energy savings\n\nThe Heat Grid energy efficiency project was successfully implemented during the planning stage of the new paint shop. The innovative concept combines several measures for efficient energy recovery, enabling additional energy savings of up to ten percent. The centrepiece of the project is a large, multivalent storage boiler that consolidates waste heat from the compressed air supply, drying ovens and cooling systems. This waste heat is then used to preheat the water circuit.\n\nAnother of Debrecen's unique features is that the whole system operates at a water supply temperature of just 65 degrees Celsius, compared to 90-120 degrees Celsius in previous installations. The hot water is used to supply the paint shop’s hall ventilation systems, maintaining stable conditions in the spray booths at a process temperature of 22 degrees Celsius and a humidity of 60-65 percent.\n\nExhaust purification in innovative eRTO process\n\nDebrecen will rely on the innovative eRTO process for exhaust purification. eRTO stands for electric regenerative thermal oxidation, a process that purifies exhaust air from the paint shop at temperatures of 800-1,000 degrees Celsius and, unlike in the past, runs exclusively on electricity. During the purification process, the exhaust air passes through a ceramic bed where solvent residues are burned off. To do this, the air has to be heated to high temperatures in a short space of time. Due to its high thermal recovery rate, with heat effectively retained within the system, the eRTO system delivers a very high level of energy efficiency.\n\nFully automated dry separation\n\nLike many other BMW Group locations, the new paint shop in Debrecen uses modern, environmentally-friendly dry separation technology. Any paint overspray that does not adhere to the body in the spray booth is filtered out and mixed with limestone powder. This significantly reduces water consumption and allows the spray booth to operate with up to 90 percent recirculating air. This means only ten percent of the air needs to be temperature controlled and humidified, rather than 100 percent, resulting in substantial energy savings. The used stone powder can also be fed back into the material loop and reused, for example, in the cement industry, rather than requiring disposal as contaminated wastewater, as was the case in the previous wet-scrubbing method.\n\nComprehensive digitalisation\n\nAlongside innovative technologies, such as Heat Grid and eRTO, comprehensive digitalisation also contributes to the new Debrecen paint shop’s high level of efficiency. For example, fully automated driverless AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) transport car bodies to their respective operations. In addition, Automated Surface Inspection (AOI) is employed, utilising artificial intelligence to detect post-painting irregularities and identify any areas requiring post-processing. The planning for the paint shop was implemented virtually. This allowed the structural planning to be tested virtually before actual construction began. Preliminary training sessions for employees were also held virtually."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Pre-series production set to launch in Hungary at the end of the year +++ High standards will ensure most resource-efficient production possible +++ Gas-free paint operations using power-to-heat process"}]}

On an exciting final Sunday, during which more than a dozen players had realistic hopes of victory, a playoff was once again required to determine the winner, just like last year. With a birdie on the first extra hole, Alex Noren secured the prestigious BMW PGA Championship title for the second time after his 2017 victory. The 43-year-old Swede triumphed with rounds of 67, 68, 66, and 68, finishing with a total score of 269 strokes (19 under par). Adrien Saddier from France needed five strokes (even par) on the first extra hole and had to settle for second place. Patrick Reed (USA) and Aaron Rai (ENG) shared third place, both finishing at 16 under par. With twelve career victories, Noren is now the most successful Swedish player in the history of the DP World Tour. A record number of 118,421 spectators flocked to the Wentworth Club this week to celebrate the Festival of Golf.\n\n“On behalf of BMW, I would like to congratulate Alex Noren on winning the 2025 BMW PGA Championship. The Festival of Golf lived up to its reputation once again, and Alex’s performance all week played a significant role in it,“ said David George, CEO at BMW Group UK and Ireland. “For more than 20 years, BMW has been a proud title partner to this outstanding golf event. It’s great to experience the sense of joy surrounding the players and fans at the BMW PGA Championship. We are equally proud to support the Golf Foundation through Eagles for Education in their efforts to strengthen mental resilience in pupils and in helping them on their way to a self-determined future.“\n\nDuring the four rounds of the BMW PGA Championship, the world-class field carded a total of 72 eagles. For each of these, the BMW Group is donating £1,000 to the Golf Foundation as part of its Eagles for Education initiative. The total sum of £72,000 will support the Golf Foundation‘s Unleash Your Drive programme, which brings simplified versions of the game of golf to schools across England. Pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged regions and underprivileged families, are taught to remain resilient, focused, and determined in the face of challenges. These skills will help to prepare youngsters for life inside and outside the classroom.\n\nNoren contributed an eagle during his four tournament rounds and owes his triumph primarily to his consistency. He was the only player to record no more than 68 strokes (4 under par) in any round. The European Ryder Cup team's vice-captain showcased his outstanding form, having won the British Masters just three weeks ago. “It’s so many emotions right now. Sometimes it comes easy. Sometimes you’ve just got to fight. Today it felt like a fight,” said Noren. “This tournament is unbelievable, it‘s one of the best tournaments in the world and it gets better every year.“\n\nAt the 2025 BMW PGA Championship, the new all-electric BMW iX3 50 xDrive celebrated its UK premiere as the tournament's Hole-in-One prize.

Adrien Saddier from France needed five strokes (even par) on the first extra hole and had to settle for second place. Patrick Reed (USA) and Aaron Rai (ENG) shared third place, both finishing at 16 under par. With twelve career victories, Noren is now the most successful Swedish player in the history of the DP World Tour. A record number of 118,421 spectators flocked to the Wentworth Club this week to celebrate the Festival of Golf.\n\n“On behalf of BMW, I would like to congratulate Alex Noren on winning the 2025 BMW PGA Championship. The Festival of Golf lived up to its reputation once again, and Alex’s performance all week played a significant role in it,“ said David George, CEO at BMW Group UK and Ireland. “For more than 20 years, BMW has been a proud title partner to this outstanding golf event. It’s great to experience the sense of joy surrounding the players and fans at the BMW PGA Championship. We are equally proud to support the Golf Foundation through Eagles for Education in their efforts to strengthen mental resilience in pupils and in helping them on their way to a self-determined future.“\n\nDuring the four rounds of the BMW PGA Championship, the world-class field carded a total of 72 eagles. For each of these, the BMW Group is donating £1,000 to the Golf Foundation as part of its Eagles for Education initiative. The total sum of £72,000 will support the Golf Foundation‘s Unleash Your Drive programme, which brings simplified versions of the game of golf to schools across England. Pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged regions and underprivileged families, are taught to remain resilient, focused, and determined in the face of challenges. These skills will help to prepare youngsters for life inside and outside the classroom.\n\nNoren contributed an eagle during his four tournament rounds and owes his triumph primarily to his consistency. He was the only player to record no more than 68 strokes (4 under par) in any round. The European Ryder Cup team's vice-captain showcased his outstanding form, having won the British Masters just three weeks ago. “It’s so many emotions right now. Sometimes it comes easy. Sometimes you’ve just got to fight. Today it felt like a fight,” said Noren. “This tournament is unbelievable, it‘s one of the best tournaments in the world and it gets better every year.“\n\nAt the 2025 BMW PGA Championship, the new all-electric BMW iX3 50 xDrive celebrated its UK premiere as the tournament's Hole-in-One prize. The Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) is the first model of the Neue Klasse and heralds a new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure. However, no player managed to score an ace on the 14th hole this week, which would have been rewarded with the new BMW iX3.\n\nThe eleven players of the European Ryder Cup team, who competed at the Wentworth Club alongside their captain Luke Donald (ENG), departed together for New York on Sunday to prepare for their title defense against Team USA. In addition to Noren, Viktor Hovland (NOR), Tyrrell Hatton, and Matt Fitzpatrick (both ENG, all -15, T5) also carry strong results into the event. The Ryder Cup (September 23–28, 2025, Bethpage Black Course near New York, USA) will feature BMW as a Worldwide Partner for the third time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

The new F 450 GS impresses with its powerful performance and pulling power, delivering a power output of 35 kW (48 hp) at 8,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 43 Nm at 6,750 rpm.Thanks to the use of high-tech materials and optimized internal friction, these performance values are achieved with exactly 420 cm³. This makes the engine one of the most compact and powerful in the A2 two-cylinder segment. It not only meets the strict EU5+ requirements but is also particularly economical, consuming just 3.8 liters per 100 km. A range of over 350 km can be achieved in conjunction with the 14-liter tank. The maintenance interval is the standard 10,000 km for BMW motorcycles.\n\nUnique on the motorcycle market, the engine features a crankshaft with crankpins offset by 135 degrees and, in conjunction with a single balance shaft, sets a technical exclamation mark: this design ensures a characterful, emotional ride while simultaneously reducing unwanted vibrations to an exceptionally low level.\n\nEasy Ride Clutch (ERC) for a significant increase in dynamics, operating comfort, and riding comfort.A technical highlight of the new BMW F 450 GS is the Easy Ride Clutch (ERC). Its core is a precision centrifugal unit in the clutch, which engages the clutch depending on engine speed.\n\nThis system is standard on the GS Trophy variant and available as an optional accessory for all other model variants. In combination with the Shift Assistant Pro, manual operation of the clutch lever is completely eliminated – from starting off and gear changes to demanding maneuvers.\n\nThe clutch lever, however, remains intact and allows the rider to intervene manually at any time if necessary – for example, to lift the front wheel over an obstacle or to improve control when descending on slippery surfaces.\n\nTechnologically, the ERC is based on an advanced centrifugal clutch. Unlike conventional systems, it remains closed during overrun. This creates natural, familiar, and predictable handling at all times – comparable to a conventional clutch. The engine brake remains fully active until just before a stop; only when the idle speed is reached does the ERC automatically open, reliably preventing the engine from stalling.\n\nThe system ensures greater dynamics, control, and comfort – whether maneuvering, in city traffic, on winding roads, or off-road.\n\nSix-speed transmission and left-mounted secondary drive.

The breakthrough has been achieved. BMW M Team RLL has secured the first victory of the season for the BMW M Hybrid V8 – and what a victory it was! In the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) race at Road America (USA), Philipp Eng (AUT) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL) triumphed in the #24 car. Their teammates in the #25 car, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER), completed the one-two finish by securing second place. After four pole positions and two podium finishes earlier in the season, the joy over the first win was immense. There was also great celebration at Paul Miller Racing as Neil Verhagen and Madison Snow (both USA) claimed victory in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GTD PRO class .\n\nThe two BMW M Hybrid V8s of BMW M Team RLL started the race from second and third on the grid after strong lap times in qualifying. Over the course of the 2:40-hour race, both crews experienced a rollercoaster of emotions. Initially, both cars dropped to the back of the GTP field due to an incident during a pit stop. An RLL mechanic was lightly injured after being struck by another prototype which extended the pit stop times. However, with an hour remaining, the team decided to bring both cars in early for their final refuelling stop, aiming to gain a strategic advantage during one of the race's many yellow flag periods. This strategy paid off, and after the final race neutralisation, closing drivers Eng and Wittmann led the race. They maintained this one-two lead even amidst heavy traffic with lapped cars. Following four pole positions at the start of the season and podium finishes at Long Beach and Laguna Seca (both USA), the first victory of the season for the BMW M Hybrid V8 marked a significant breakthrough.\n\nPaul Miller Racing added another reason to celebrate on this highly successful day for BMW M Motorsport. Neil Verhagen and Madison Snow (both USA) claimed victory in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in the GTD PRO category. It was the first win of the season for the driver duo and the second for the team, following the triumph of Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) at Watkins Glen (USA). This time, Harper and Hesse finished seventh in the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO after some intense battles in a chaotic race. Turner Motorsport narrowly missed the podium in the GTD class, with Robby Foley and Patrick Gallagher (both USA) finishing fourth in the #96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"What a fantastic IMSA race at Road America! Congratulations to BMW M Team RLL, Philipp Eng, and Dries Vanthoor on their first victory of the season with our BMW M Hybrid V8. Both have delivered outstanding performances, especially at the start of the season, but were unable to convert them into a win until now. Finally, it has worked out, and the hard work of everyone involved has paid off. I am equally thrilled for Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann, who made it onto the podium for the first time this season. We are clearly moving in the right direction with our Hypercar project, and it’s great to see this reflected in the results. Another heartfelt congratulations to Paul Miller Racing for their second win of the season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. This triumph not only underscores the strength of our GT3 car worldwide but also makes an already incredible race day even better. Thank you to everyone!\"\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 1st place): \"A fantastic day for the entire team. A flawless job. Thankfully, nothing more serious happened during the pit lane incident, and I’m very glad our mechanic is okay. Beyond that, it was simply a strategic masterpiece by the entire team, and the car’s balance was extremely strong. We were strong in clean air, strong in traffic, and positioned ourselves very well. In the end, it was all about making no mistakes and controlling the race. Thankfully, we managed to do that. It was an incredibly strong team effort. Every single person on the team can be extremely proud of themselves.\"\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 1st place): \"This is a fantastic result for BMW M Motorsport with the one-two finish in the GTP class and the victory in the GTD PRO class. Our weekend started well, and this time we finally managed to turn it into a win after struggling earlier in the season to fully capitalise on our speed. The team was amazing, and the strategy call was perfect. In the end, we had enough speed to bring home first place. Philipp did an excellent job. Now we’ll keep pushing and hopefully finish the season with more strong results.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 2nd place): \"A great result for us as BMW M Motorsport and BMW M Team RLL. It’s a bit of a relief after the last few races, where we were strong in qualifying but couldn’t deliver in the race. This time, everything worked out well. Ultimately, a good strategy brought us forward, but we also showed strong pace during the race. The team success with the one-two finish is, of course, fantastic. We’re super happy. I think it’s a relief for everyone on the team. Now we can head into the final two races with momentum and hope to finish the season on a high note.\"\n\nNeil Verhagen (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"My first IMSA win feels fantastic.

Two more big names have officially announced that they will be appearing at the 35th BMW International Open (3rd to 7th July 2024, Golfclub München Eichenried). In addition to claiming numerous individual titles, both have also made their mark on the Ryder Cup: Luke Donald, who last year led the European team to victory in the legendary team competition in Rome and is now starting his second term as captain, and Patrick Reed, who was dubbed “Captain America” after adopting the role of emotional leader for Team USA on his Ryder Cup debut in 2014.\n\nWherever he tees off, the 46-year-old Englishman is a crowd favourite.

Glittering movie premieres, stars gracing the red carpet and a high-performance vehicle that looks like nothing else: this is the #Cannes Film Festival and yesterday it hosted the world premiere of the #BMW XM Mystique Allure. This one-off creation is based on the first high-performance sports car from #BMW M GmbH powered by the #M HYBRID drive system. Blending progressive luxury with extravagant looks, it is inspired by British supermodel #Naomi Campbell, was designed using exclusive materials from the world of haute couture and has a unique soundtrack devised in cooperation with film score composer Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe BMW XM Mystique Allure is the latest product of the collaboration between BMW and Naomi Campbell. The partnership took its first steps last year with the “Dare to be You” launch campaign for the #BMW XM, which puts the confidence to be yourself and go your own way at centre stage.\n\nThe 77th Cannes Film Festival was the ideal choice of setting for the world premiere of the BMW XM Mystique Allure. Against the stunning backdrop of the French portside resort, Naomi Campbell presented the one-of-a-kind creation inspired by her to an audience of selected guests, before making her way in the car to the red carpet outside the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès. “Witnessing BMW's vision for the BMW XM Mystique Allure come to life has been truly incredible,” says Naomi. “I feel deeply honoured to have sparked the inspiration for their first-ever high-fashion show car, which stands as a unique masterpiece in every aspect.”\n\nThis is the third year in succession that BMW has stepped up as Official Automotive Partner of the Cannes Film Festival. And it will lay on an exclusive shuttle service of more than 200 vehicles – among them the all-electric BMW i7, BMW iX and BMW i5, and the plug-in-hybrid BMW XM – to give participants and guests at the event the experience of locally emission-free premium mobility.\n\nThe BMW XM Mystique Allure is the first vehicle in the brand’s history to be designed using materials from the high fashion industry. This unusual tie-up showcases the BMW XM in a whole new light: expressive, avant-garde – and stylish and luxurious in equal measure.\n\nInspired by Naomi’s favourite colour, the vehicle’s exterior boasts a deeply saturated ultramarine shade, accentuated by a lustrous matte finish. A contemporary translation of high-fashion materials from luxury textile manufacturers, the design seamlessly brings the inside to the outside, featuring rich velvet and shimmering Frozen metallic sequins casting hues ranging from intense violet to deep ultramarine.\n\nThe iridescent surfaces were created with precise handcraftsmanship and a fine eye for detail. They take their cues from the eye-catching geometric forms of the BMW XM and bring a special visual richness to the car’s extrovert aesthetic. The design of the BMW XM Mystique Allure provides a meeting point for high performance and haute couture, and paints a unique picture of progressive luxury that continues into the interior. All of the surfaces inside the car, including the M Lounge in the rear, are covered in purple velvet.\n\nThe bold appearance of the BMW XM Mystique Allure is complemented by an acoustic character also very much its own. At its heart is a bespoke adaptation of the BMW IconicSounds Electric developed as part of the collaboration between BMW Group Sound Design and film score composer Hans Zimmer.\n\nThe driving track created for the Naomi Campbell-inspired one-off projects the supreme confidence of the car’s exterior design onto the soundscape of locally emission-free driving. In the M HYBRID drive system’s all-electric operating mode, every movement of the accelerator is accompanied by an emotionally engaging sound that authentically represents the car’s outstanding performance and magnetic visual allure.\n\nThe BMW XM is the first model since the legendary BMW M1 to be conceived solely as a standalone high-performance car from BMW M GmbH. It blends dynamic potency with innovative luxury and an enticingly extravagant design composed of muscular proportions and powerful contours. Two-piece split headlight units, Iconic Glow contour lighting for the BMW kidney grille, accent bands along the sides of the car, light-alloy wheels up to 23 inches in size and the vertically stacked and hexagonally formed pairs of exhaust tailpipes integrated into the rear apron ensure the exterior of the XM has an inimitable visual presence.\n\nIn the event of enquiries please contact:\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: Electric power and petrol consumption – weighted, combined: 33.5 kWh/100 km and 2.0 l/100 km [141.2 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions – weighted, combined: 45 g/km (WLTP); fuel consumption with discharged battery: 12.9 l/100 km [21.9 mpg imp] as per WLTP; CO2 classes: with discharged battery G; weighted, combined B."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ One-of-a-kind creation is the latest product of the collaboration between BMW and the British supermodel +++ High performance meets haute couture +++ Presentation during the Cannes Film Festival +++ BMW is Official Automotive Partner of the renowned festival for the third year in succession +++"}]}

A group of athletes from the Bavarian disabled and rehabilitation sports association (BVS Bayern) was invited to the BMW M Driving Experience in Maisach to take part in a safety training course with biathlon world champions Maren Hammerschmidt and Vanessa Hinz, an event that was as much about knowledge as it was about driving pleasure.\n\nThe BMW M Driving Experience offers a special safety training course designed by Tina Schmidt-Kiendl, who is an instructor and head of project management at BMW M GmbH. The training course uses specially modified vehicles with hand-controlled equipment (electronic accelerator ring on the steering wheel or thumb accelerator with separate brake) that can be controlled by paraplegic persons and also persons with use of their feet. There is also a vehicle that can be operated by people who are paralysed on one side, for example, after a stroke. In addition to a theory section, the training content includes driving using hand controls, braking and evasion exercises, as well as the correct way to respond when oversteering or understeering the vehicle.\n\n“People being able to drive a car themselves and safely despite a disability is self-sufficiency – and that is very important,” said Schmidt-Kiendl, who has been paraplegic since an operation, describing the inclusive value of this safety training course. “You can decide for yourself when you want to drive from A to B, and which route you take. You don’t have to simply go along with decisions that other people want to make for you. This independence, combined with autonomy and safety on the road is what we want to convey to the participants.”\n\nThe safety training course with modified cars is also open to persons without physical limitations, for example, those who work with people with disabilities. The 2017 biathlon world champions, Maren Hammerschmidt and Vanessa Hinz, experienced this in Maisach and were impressed by the encounters and experiences at the BMW M Driving Experience.\n\n“It is definitely exciting to try it out and have this opportunity. This was our first safety training course – and it was one with special requirements,” said Hammerschmidt. “It was a lot of fun, including the exchange with the other athletes and finding out a little bit about their history.”\n\nHinz was also impressed by the insights: “It is interesting to see the challenges that these people face. Neither of us were aware of this because we just get into the car, push a button, and go. Neither of us could have imagined previously how it would work if you were unable to use your feet.”\n\nThe BVS Bayern athletes have long since learned how to work around their disabilities. The biggest sports association for people with disabilities in Bavaria covers a wide sporting range: from preparing and mentoring young athletes as they train for the Paralympics, to recreational sport and the promotion of inclusion in sport, to rehabilitation sport.\n\nRepresenting all the participants, Svenja Mayer, who finished fourth with the German national wheelchair basketball team at the 2021 Paralympic Games, said: “I would like to thank BMW and the national biathlon team for the amazing experience. You feel a rush of endorphins when you can accelerate. We also learned a lot of important things that will come in useful in everyday life and on the road. It was a fantastic day.”\n\nThis feedback is the motivation that drives Schmidt-Kiendl because she is convinced that everyone has the right to enjoy sheer driving pleasure, whether with or without a handicap. People who feel safe at the wheel, can rely on their abilities, and master the technology are the people who enjoy driving. She has also incorporated exercises that are fun into her driver safety training and can definitely be seen as a sporting challenge, such as completing a timed slalom course. These were the exercises that were very well received by a group made up of athletes. “It was exciting to watch how athletes handle this kind of situation,” said Schmidt-Kiendl. “Because they all want to be the best, naturally.”\n\nThe BMW M Driving Experience is a division of BMW M GmbH. Founded as BMW Fahrertraining (driver training) in 1977, across all sectors on offer, from safety training for novice drivers to the highly dynamic racetrack experience for experienced drivers, the goal is improving the driving skills of participants.

A rule of thumb in bobsleigh is that success is one-third start time, one-third equipment, and one-third performance on the steering pulley. When pushing off, it is the athletic prowess of the athletes that is key, but as in track and field, footwear also affects being able to generate maximum acceleration. Yet, while there are many different types of spiked shoes tailored to the requirements of different disciplines and personal preferences available for high-performance sport on the tartan track, comparable products for the ice channel have long been lacking.\n\nAs technology partner of the German Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton Federation (BSD), BMW Group is committed to changing this – and using 3D printing processes from automotive development and manufacturing, they also have the perfect method and the required expertise to implement the project.\n\nDefined rows of nails are permanently attached to the toe area of the soles of convential bobsleigh shoes; these nails cannot be replaced or moved, meaning that once the nails have worn out, the shoe is destined for the rubbish heap. The solution that BMW and the BSD are working on is based on track and field shoes, for which threads for screw spikes are used to attach spike plates on which the spike nails can largely be distributed without restriction. This combines several advantages. There is a large selection of shoe styles, so athletes can use a shoe that suits their individual needs. The material and geometry of the plate, as well as the placement of the spike nails, can be used to vary the rigidity and, above all, the power transmission to the ice. With respect to individual running styles as well as the different running paths that the various positions entail, especially in a 4-man bobsleigh, this ensures better acceleration than standard spikes could ever make possible.\n\nIn practice, this means that customised spike plates have to be designed and efficiently manufactured for each athlete, a task with which the BMW Group Additive Manufacturing Center is very familiar. Here, plastics and metals are used to produce a large number of components without the need for tools or moulds. “We have been using 3D printing to make components for prototypes, customised one-offs, as well as for series production for more than 30 years,” said Claudia Rackl, BMW Group Additive Manufacturing Projects & Qualification. “The major advantages of 3D printing are the time and cost savings as well as a high degree of flexibility. This allows us to quickly manufacture, test and efficiently optimise different variants.”\n\nBMW Group engineers have transferred this expertise from automotive engineering directly to bobsleigh.

It will also be possible to produce special spike plates for the individual requirements of athletes or even for different weather and ice conditions.\n\n“We tested the spike plates in the World Cup and received a lot of positive feedback from the athletes,” said bobsleigh head coach René Spies. “Nevertheless, a few tweaks are still necessary here and there, but we expect to have the perfect shoes to compete in by the 2026 Olympic Winter Games at the latest.”\n\nThis would then create the ideal conditions for the first third on the road to success, the optimum start time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ Technology partner BMW is developing spike plates for the German Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton Federation +++ 3D printing technology from automotive engineering facilitates customised solutions and efficient optimisation cycles +++ The focus is on the 2026 Olympic Winter Games +++ Image and video material available +++"}]}

Traditionally, it is reserved for inline skaters to open the competitions on Saturday as part of the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON. For the 50th anniversary of Germany's largest marathon, a course with a vibrant stadium atmosphere was driven for the first time, initially leading through a five-time loop from the Großer Stern via Ernst-Reuter-Platz and Otto-Suhr-Allee to Charlottenburg Palace and back from there. For the grand finale, the inline skaters raced, cheered on by the usual euphoric Berlin crowd, over the traditional section of the course along the Landwehr Canal, Potsdamer Platz, Gendarmenmarkt, Unter den Linden, to the finish line.\n\nAhead of the athletes, a small fleet of fully electric BMW CE 04 and BMW CE 02 scooters drove the course. The electrically powered two-wheelers ate specifically developed for urban driving pleasure, and the BMW CE 04 is manufactured at the BMW Group Plant Berlin, the home of international BMW motorcycle production. This exclusive ride also began there, ending with the crossing of the iconic Brandenburg Gate. A special moment that will also be unforgettable for all athletes on the following Sunday. At the 50th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON, the BMW CE 04, as well as fully electric BMW cars, are also in use as timekeeping, course, and organizational vehicles.\n\nFollowing the scooter fleet were more than 3,300 inline skaters, who due to the high speed, held their race separate from other athletes. In total, around 85,000 people from 161 nations – both are records for the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON – will be active in various disciplines over the weekend.\n\nBart Swings delivered a committed solo race and secured his ninth victory in this event. The Belgian attacked very early, gaining a 30-second lead, which he continued to extend. His teammates Jason Suttels (BEL, winner in 2023) and Felix Rijhnen (GER, winner in 2019) controlled the field, then secured the remaining podium spots in the final sprint. Swings won in 1:00:02 hours, ahead of Suttels and Rijhnen (both 1:01:31). The women's race was also marked by many attacks, though no rider managed to break away. The eventual winner, Noraly Berber, initiated the sprint together with her teammates well before the Brandenburg Gate – a tactic that proved successful, though just barely. Berber Vonk crossed the finish line in 1:13:53 hours, with second and third places going to Colombians Johana Viveros (1:13:53) and Aura Quintana Herrera (1:13:54) in a nail-biting finish.\n\nThe BMW CE 04 is the perfect urban companion. With its electric drive, forward-looking design and innovative connectivity solutions, the scooter perfectly merges transport and communication functions. Offering a maximum output of 31 kW (42 hp), a maximum speed of 120 km/h and a range of some 130 kilometres, the BMW CE 04 is capable of speedy progress not just in the city but on main roads and motorway sections, too.\n\nWith the new BMW CE 02, BMW Motorrad is offering another electric vehicle for urban conurbations and a new way into the world of BMW Motorrad. The BMW CE 02 is electric, particularly appealing to younger people, and is made for the city: nimble, practical, robust and reduced to the essentials in terms of design.\n\nWith a maximum power output of 11 kW /15 PS, the new CE 02 can be ridden by persons aged 16 and above. In a 4 kW / 5 hp (rated power 3.2 kW / 4 hp) version limited to 45 km/h, the new CE 02 also meets the requirements of the AM driving licence class and can be ridden in Germany, for example, from the age of 15 and by riders who have a car licence.\n\nThe BMW Group plant in Berlin can look back on a long tradition of motorcycle manufacturing. BMW motorcycles have been produced in Berlin-Spandau since 1969. With over 2,400 employees and a capacity of up to 900 motorcycles and premium e-scooters per day, the plant is the heart of BMW Motorrad’s global production.\n\nCorporate communications\n\nPress Spokesperson BMW Group Sport Engagement, Real Estate\n\nHead of Communication BMW Group Plant Berlin\n\nTelefon: +49 151 6030 2225\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i5 M60 xDrive: electric power consumption combined: 20.5 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO2 classes: A"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "+++ From the BMW Group Plant Berlin to the Brandenburg Gate: eScooters BMW CE 04 and eParkourer BMW CE 02 ride emission-free through the German capital +++ Bart Swings (BEL) and Noraly Berber Vonk (NED) win the 50th BMW BERLIN-MARATHON Inline Skating +++ Record: nearly 85,000 active people on the track for the anniversary +++"}]}

Swings won in 1:00:02 hours, ahead of Suttels and Rijhnen (both 1:01:31). The women's race was also marked by many attacks, though no rider managed to break away. The eventual winner, Noraly Berber, initiated the sprint together with her teammates well before the Brandenburg Gate – a tactic that proved successful, though just barely.

The BMW CE 02 is electric, particularly appealing to younger people, and is made for the city: nimble, practical, robust and reduced to the essentials in terms of design.\n\nWith a maximum power output of 11 kW /15 PS, the new CE 02 can be ridden by persons aged 16 and above. In a 4 kW / 5 hp (rated power 3.2 kW / 4 hp) version limited to 45 km/h, the new CE 02 also meets the requirements of the AM driving licence class and can be ridden in Germany, for example, from the age of 15 and by riders who have a car licence.\n\nThe BMW Group plant in Berlin can look back on a long tradition of motorcycle manufacturing.

At the season finale of the 2024 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), the 24-hour Bol d’Or race at Le Castellet (FRA), the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team experienced all the highs and setbacks that endurance racing can offer. Starting from pole position, Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), Markus Reiterberger (GER), and Hannes Soomer (EST) were running at the front for a long time, even taking the lead at points. In the tough second half of the race, the entire team showed great fighting spirit. After 24 dramatic racing hours, in which many teams faced difficulties, the #37 BMW M 1000 RR crossed the finish line in fifth place (fourth in the EWC class). This result allowed the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team to maintain its spot on the World Championship podium, finishing the season in third overall.\n\nFrom the first test session, the speed of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR was evident. With a perfect qualifying session, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team secured pole position for the 87th edition of the endurance classic. The race, which started at 15:00 on Saturday, went according to plan until the early hours of Sunday morning, with the goal of winning in sight. In the highly competitive front group, Mikhalchik, Reiterberger, and Soomer consistently held second place, pushing hard for the lead. Reiterberger even set a new lap record with a time of 1:52.517 minutes. After eleven hours of racing, the #37 BMW M 1000 RR was in the lead.\n\nThe first scare came early Sunday morning. After a heavy highside crash, Soomer sustained a fractured upper arm and a dislocated shoulder. However, the Estonian gritted his teeth, picked up the bike, and rode it back to the pits despite his injuries. From then on, Mikhalchik and Reiterberger continued the race as a duo. Before long, they had worked their way back up to second place, holding that position until the morning. As a consequence of the crash, a fuel system issue arose, requiring multiple repairs in the pits. Nevertheless, the entire team gave everything and got the #37 back on track. Mikhalchik and Reiterberger showed tremendous fighting spirit, launched another comeback, and ultimately finished in fifth place.\n\nIn the Superstock class, the three BMW teams impressed in qualifying, securing the top three positions. Pole position went to the French Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team. Riding the #9 BMW M 1000 RR were Kenny Foray (FRA), Jan Bühn (GER), Loïc Arbel (FRA), and Jan-Ole Jähnig (GER), who joined the team as the fourth rider for the race. The newly formed Hungarian HERT by Moto Jungle team (#713 BMW M 1000 RR) immediately secured second place on the grid in their race debut with riders Bálint Kovács, Soma Görbe, Péter Sebestyén, and Máté Számadó (all HUN). Completing the qualifying success were Hikari Okubo, Kazuki Watanabe, Shogo Kawasaki, and Yudai Kamei (all JPN) from the Japanese Team Étoile (#25 BMW M 1000 RR), who finished third in qualifying. The team had already achieved an excellent second place at the Suzuka 8 Hours (JPN) behind Team TONE RT SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW.\n\nIn the race, the three Superstock teams continued their impressive performances, battling for victory and leading the standings for long stretches. However, as the race progressed, the harsh realities of endurance racing, which tests both man and machine, emerged. Unfortunately, all teams were forced to retire early due to technical issues.\n\nReactions after the Bol d’Or.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Highs and setbacks – the Bol d'Or once again demonstrated all sides of endurance racing. After securing pole position with a strong performance, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team fought long and hard for the victory we had all hoped for. The pace of the BMW M 1000 RR, the riders’ performances, and the entire team’s work were once again impressive. However, endurance racing doesn’t always reward these efforts. Equally impressive was the tireless effort and fighting spirit to overcome the difficulties later in the race and still achieve the best possible result under these conditions. At the same time, we wish Hannes a speedy recovery after his severe crash. A huge thank you to the entire team and our riders for a strong performance throughout the entire season. The BMW Superstock teams were also convincing, initially securing a triple success in qualifying and then dominating the race at the top of the class. Unfortunately, they too faced setbacks. Nevertheless, it is clear that the BMW M 1000 RR competes at the top of the world in both the Superbike and Superstock classes.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was a race of mixed feelings because we were the strongest. And our riders were the strongest. To not be on the podium then is painful, to be honest. In qualifying, we were much stronger than the rest. In the race, we had the pace to win. Markus and Ilya were one second faster than everybody else. Hannes also did a very good and stable job. Then we were leading the race, being 20 seconds in front. Hannes overtook someone, came off the ideal line and had a big highside. The mechanics did an incredible job to repair the bike in only nine minutes. But from then on we had issues. We climbed back to second place but there were more issues and in the end it was P5 – and the third place in the World Championship standings. This of course is not bad but it is painful if you know that the bike and the riders had everything to take victory this weekend.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “We had the potential to take the win. Unfortunately, we had a crash and later technical issues, and didn’t make it to the podium. But we gave it our all and finished the last twelve hours of the race with just two riders. Our focus then was to make it to the finish. I now feel every bone after the 15 stints I did. It’s a shame we’re not on the podium – but we’ll try again! A big thanks to the entire team.”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “It was tough, I think it was the toughest 24-hour race I ever had. In all aspects. There was a lot of action on the track, and then for half of the race I was only riding with Markus so I am really tired now but for sure happy that we did this incredible job. The team was also working so fast in the box when we had some technical issues. We were all on the highest level. I am a little bit upset as we had the pace to win this race and we had bad luck. But this motorsport and this can happen. So let’s take the positives from the performance and let’s keep pushing!”\n\nHannes Soomer (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “It was definitely not the Bol d’Or I was hoping for or what would have been possible. The beginning of the race was quite good, until the halfway point when I had a big crash during the night. It started with a small slide from the rear and I just could not save it and had a big highside. It was an unlucky incident, maybe I was pushing too hard in the night to keep the lead. I want to say sorry to the team and will learn from this. I dislocated my shoulder, suffered a fracture to my arm, and after that I was out and Markus and Ilya had to work really hard to finish the race. They are unbelievably strong and did an incredible job until the finish line to claim the best result they could get. I am disappointed about my crash but happy for the team to finish the season in the top 3 of the world championship.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At the season finale of the 2024 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), the 24-hour Bol d’Or race at Le Castellet (FRA), the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team experienced all the highs and setbacks that endurance racing can offer.

At the season finale of the 2024 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), the 24-hour Bol d’Or race at Le Castellet (FRA), the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team experienced all the highs and setbacks that endurance racing can offer. Starting from pole position, Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), Markus Reiterberger (GER), and Hannes Soomer (EST) were running at the front for a long time, even taking the lead at points. In the tough second half of the race, the entire team showed great fighting spirit. After 24 dramatic racing hours, in which many teams faced difficulties, the #37 BMW M 1000 RR crossed the finish line in fifth place (fourth in the EWC class). This result allowed the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team to maintain its spot on the World Championship podium, finishing the season in third overall.\n\nFrom the first test session, the speed of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR was evident. With a perfect qualifying session, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team secured pole position for the 87th edition of the endurance classic. The race, which started at 15:00 on Saturday, went according to plan until the early hours of Sunday morning, with the goal of winning in sight. In the highly competitive front group, Mikhalchik, Reiterberger, and Soomer consistently held second place, pushing hard for the lead. Reiterberger even set a new lap record with a time of 1:52.517 minutes. After eleven hours of racing, the #37 BMW M 1000 RR was in the lead.\n\nThe first scare came early Sunday morning. After a heavy highside crash, Soomer sustained a fractured upper arm and a dislocated shoulder. However, the Estonian gritted his teeth, picked up the bike, and rode it back to the pits despite his injuries. From then on, Mikhalchik and Reiterberger continued the race as a duo. Before long, they had worked their way back up to second place, holding that position until the morning. As a consequence of the crash, a fuel system issue arose, requiring multiple repairs in the pits. Nevertheless, the entire team gave everything and got the #37 back on track. Mikhalchik and Reiterberger showed tremendous fighting spirit, launched another comeback, and ultimately finished in fifth place.\n\nIn the Superstock class, the three BMW teams impressed in qualifying, securing the top three positions. Pole position went to the French Tecmas-MRP-BMW Racing Team. Riding the #9 BMW M 1000 RR were Kenny Foray (FRA), Jan Bühn (GER), Loïc Arbel (FRA), and Jan-Ole Jähnig (GER), who joined the team as the fourth rider for the race. The newly formed Hungarian HERT by Moto Jungle team (#713 BMW M 1000 RR) immediately secured second place on the grid in their race debut with riders Bálint Kovács, Soma Görbe, Péter Sebestyén, and Máté Számadó (all HUN). Completing the qualifying success were Hikari Okubo, Kazuki Watanabe, Shogo Kawasaki, and Yudai Kamei (all JPN) from the Japanese Team Étoile (#25 BMW M 1000 RR), who finished third in qualifying. The team had already achieved an excellent second place at the Suzuka 8 Hours (JPN) behind Team TONE RT SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW.\n\nIn the race, the three Superstock teams continued their impressive performances, battling for victory and leading the standings for long stretches. However, as the race progressed, the harsh realities of endurance racing, which tests both man and machine, emerged. Unfortunately, all teams were forced to retire early due to technical issues.\n\nReactions after the Bol d’Or.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Highs and setbacks – the Bol d'Or once again demonstrated all sides of endurance racing. After securing pole position with a strong performance, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team fought long and hard for the victory we had all hoped for. The pace of the BMW M 1000 RR, the riders’ performances, and the entire team’s work were once again impressive. However, endurance racing doesn’t always reward these efforts. Equally impressive was the tireless effort and fighting spirit to overcome the difficulties later in the race and still achieve the best possible result under these conditions. At the same time, we wish Hannes a speedy recovery after his severe crash. A huge thank you to the entire team and our riders for a strong performance throughout the entire season. The BMW Superstock teams were also convincing, initially securing a triple success in qualifying and then dominating the race at the top of the class. Unfortunately, they too faced setbacks. Nevertheless, it is clear that the BMW M 1000 RR competes at the top of the world in both the Superbike and Superstock classes.”\n\nWerner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was a race of mixed feelings because we were the strongest. And our riders were the strongest. To not be on the podium then is painful, to be honest. In qualifying, we were much stronger than the rest. In the race, we had the pace to win. Markus and Ilya were one second faster than everybody else. Hannes also did a very good and stable job. Then we were leading the race, being 20 seconds in front. Hannes overtook someone, came off the ideal line and had a big highside. The mechanics did an incredible job to repair the bike in only nine minutes. But from then on we had issues. We climbed back to second place but there were more issues and in the end it was P5 – and the third place in the World Championship standings. This of course is not bad but it is painful if you know that the bike and the riders had everything to take victory this weekend.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “We had the potential to take the win. Unfortunately, we had a crash and later technical issues, and didn’t make it to the podium. But we gave it our all and finished the last twelve hours of the race with just two riders. Our focus then was to make it to the finish. I now feel every bone after the 15 stints I did. It’s a shame we’re not on the podium – but we’ll try again! A big thanks to the entire team.”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “It was tough, I think it was the toughest 24-hour race I ever had. In all aspects. There was a lot of action on the track, and then for half of the race I was only riding with Markus so I am really tired now but for sure happy that we did this incredible job. The team was also working so fast in the box when we had some technical issues. We were all on the highest level. I am a little bit upset as we had the pace to win this race and we had bad luck. But this motorsport and this can happen. So let’s take the positives from the performance and let’s keep pushing!”\n\nHannes Soomer (#37 BMW M 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team): “It was definitely not the Bol d’Or I was hoping for or what would have been possible. The beginning of the race was quite good, until the halfway point when I had a big crash during the night. It started with a small slide from the rear and I just could not save it and had a big highside. It was an unlucky incident, maybe I was pushing too hard in the night to keep the lead. I want to say sorry to the team and will learn from this. I dislocated my shoulder, suffered a fracture to my arm, and after that I was out and Markus and Ilya had to work really hard to finish the race. They are unbelievably strong and did an incredible job until the finish line to claim the best result they could get. I am disappointed about my crash but happy for the team to finish the season in the top 3 of the world championship.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "FIM EWC Bol d’Or: Pole position, race lead, and fighting spirit."}]}

Nurturing young racing talent has been one of the cornerstones of BMW M Motorsport’s programme for decades. Most recently, BMW Junior Team made waves in GT racing for several years, nurturing talents such as Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Neil Verhagen (USA) into accomplished BMW M works drivers. In a high-profile line-up, they join forces with Charles Weerts (BEL) to form the group born after the turn of the millennium. For the 2024 season, BMW M Motorsport has given them a name and a new logo: Gen2K.\n\n“Generation 2000”, comprising the three members of the BMW Junior Team and Weerts, who has already achieved numerous successes in GT racing at a young age with Team WRT in recent years, embodies BMW M Motorsport’s approach to infuse its line-up with not only experience but also youthful dynamism making it as versatile as possible.\n\nThe Gen2K racing programme is also diverse. Harper, Hesse, and Weerts will contest the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (GER) in June in the BMW M Team RMG BMW M4 GT3. While Harper and Hesse have grown up on the Nordschleife as part of their training and have contested many races there, Weerts will make his debut at the endurance classic in the Eifel region. The trio will hit the track for the first time in the BMW M4 GT3 this coming weekend during test sessions ahead of the start of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NES) season.\n\nMoreover, all three drivers will compete in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, albeit for different teams. Harper and Hesse for ROWE Racing, Weerts for BMW M Team WRT. Additionally, Hesse will undertake race outings for BMW Team Italia Ceccato Racing in the Italian GT Championship, while Harper will participate in selected events of the British GT Championship, where he clinched the driver’s title in 2023. Verhagen will contest the entire season of the Fanatec GT World Challenge America powered by AWS for ST Racing in North America, as well as the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup races for Paul Miller Racing.\n\nBeyond their race commitments, there will be joint events with the Gen2K members, and they may also serve as mentors for an even younger generation of motorsport talent, leveraging their experience gained during their training. Details regarding this will be announced at a later date. Just like with the BMW Junior Team, BMW M Motorsport legend Jochen Neerpasch will mentor Gen2K. The Gen2K logo will accompany the drivers on their racing suits as well as on vehicles.\n\nQuotes about the Gen2K:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are generally very proud of our line-up of BMW M works drivers, but particularly proud of its diversity. Our drivers hail from twelve different nations, spanning ages from 23 to 55 years old, nine of them are younger than 30. To have four drivers born in the year 2000 and later who already have several years of experience at the highest level is remarkable. Added to that, we have international champions like Sheldon van der Linde and Dries Vanthoor, who are only slightly older than the Gen2K drivers. This forward-thinking line-up is impressive.”\n\nDan Harper: “Being part of the new Gen2K sounds very cool! It’s great to see how many young drivers BMW M Motorsport has in its line-up and how fast they are. I’m excited to see what lies ahead for me. Furthermore, I’m very much looking forward to competing for the fourth time with BMW M Team RMG on the Nordschleife. Charles is new to the team and will be tackling the 24-hour race in a GT3 car for the first time, but I’m sure he has the optimal crew by his side to quickly find his speed.”\n\nMax Hesse: “The Gen2K concept from BMW M Motorsport sounds awesome, and the logo looks cool! I’m very excited to be a part of it. Getting to start again on the Nordschleife with BMW M Team RMG is great. The team led by Stefan Reinhold has been doing a fantastic job for years. Now it’s time to reward that effort with a strong result at the 24-hour race. With Charles, we’ve already spent some days together in the race simulator and get along very well. Testing on the track starts this coming weekend, and I can hardly wait.”\n\nCharles Weerts: “The fact that an iconic brand like BMW M Motorsport has some young works drivers in its line-up shows their confidence in youth and their vision for the future of racing. For me, it’s a great experience to be a part of it. I’m particularly looking forward to the new challenge of the 24 Hours of Nürburgring on this iconic track. I’ll give it my all and can’t wait to start working with BMW M Team RMG.”\n\nNeil Verhagen: “The fact that I - just like Dan and Max - am now entering my fifth season with BMW M Motorsport demonstrates how much the brand cares about nurturing young drivers. I’m very proud to be a works driver for a brand with such deep motorsport roots and look forward to representing BMW M Motorsport again in the upcoming season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nurturing young racing talent has been one of the cornerstones of BMW M Motorsport’s programme for decades.

Verhagen will contest the entire season of the Fanatec GT World Challenge America powered by AWS for ST Racing in North America, as well as the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup races for Paul Miller Racing.\n\nBeyond their race commitments, there will be joint events with the Gen2K members, and they may also serve as mentors for an even younger generation of motorsport talent, leveraging their experience gained during their training. Details regarding this will be announced at a later date. Just like with the BMW Junior Team, BMW M Motorsport legend Jochen Neerpasch will mentor Gen2K. The Gen2K logo will accompany the drivers on their racing suits as well as on vehicles.\n\nQuotes about the Gen2K:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “We are generally very proud of our line-up of BMW M works drivers, but particularly proud of its diversity. Our drivers hail from twelve different nations, spanning ages from 23 to 55 years old, nine of them are younger than 30. To have four drivers born in the year 2000 and later who already have several years of experience at the highest level is remarkable. Added to that, we have international champions like Sheldon van der Linde and Dries Vanthoor, who are only slightly older than the Gen2K drivers. This forward-thinking line-up is impressive.”\n\nDan Harper: “Being part of the new Gen2K sounds very cool! It’s great to see how many young drivers BMW M Motorsport has in its line-up and how fast they are. I’m excited to see what lies ahead for me. Furthermore, I’m very much looking forward to competing for the fourth time with BMW M Team RMG on the Nordschleife. Charles is new to the team and will be tackling the 24-hour race in a GT3 car for the first time, but I’m sure he has the optimal crew by his side to quickly find his speed.”\n\nMax Hesse: “The Gen2K concept from BMW M Motorsport sounds awesome, and the logo looks cool! I’m very excited to be a part of it. Getting to start again on the Nordschleife with BMW M Team RMG is great. The team led by Stefan Reinhold has been doing a fantastic job for years. Now it’s time to reward that effort with a strong result at the 24-hour race. With Charles, we’ve already spent some days together in the race simulator and get along very well. Testing on the track starts this coming weekend, and I can hardly wait.”\n\nCharles Weerts: “The fact that an iconic brand like BMW M Motorsport has some young works drivers in its line-up shows their confidence in youth and their vision for the future of racing. For me, it’s a great experience to be a part of it. I’m particularly looking forward to the new challenge of the 24 Hours of Nürburgring on this iconic track. I’ll give it my all and can’t wait to start working with BMW M Team RMG.”\n\nNeil Verhagen: “The fact that I - just like Dan and Max - am now entering my fifth season with BMW M Motorsport demonstrates how much the brand cares about nurturing young drivers. I’m very proud to be a works driver for a brand with such deep motorsport roots and look forward to representing BMW M Motorsport again in the upcoming season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Gen2K: BMW M Motorsport unveils new logo for its “young guns” – Start at the 24h Nürburgring."}]}

At this year's 24 Hours of Daytona, we showed strong pace in the race but were not able to reward ourselves with good results. We want to do better at Sebring. We have analysed the data from Daytona and drawn our conclusions. The test we had at Sebring a few weeks ago gives us confidence that we can play a good role in the race on Saturday. The goal is to get on the podium again. In the GTD categories, I also expect our BMW M Motorsport teams to have good chances again.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “Sebring is one of my favorite tracks in North America – really old school!

We had a good test there a few weeks ago and were able to make significant progress compared to last year.

We have analysed the data from Daytona and drawn our conclusions. The test we had at Sebring a few weeks ago gives us confidence that we can play a good role in the race on Saturday.

In the GTD categories, I also expect our BMW M Motorsport teams to have good chances again.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8): “Sebring is one of my favorite tracks in North America – really old school!

Julie Mehretu presents her first design studies for the 20th BMW Art Car. For this project, the internationally renowned artist combines her artistic work with a personal enthusiasm for automotive design and speed. She translates dynamism into form and applies one of her monumental motifs from a two-dimensional picture plane onto a three-dimensional industrially designed object. In the course of this creative process, the BMW M Hybrid V8 racing car prototype becomes the canvas of Mehretu's multi-layered art and the next addition to the legendary BMW Art Car Collection. The 20th BMW Art Car will celebrate its official world premiere at the Centre Pompidou in Paris on May 21, 2024, before competing a few weeks later in the 24 Hours of Le Mans on June 15/16.\n\nFusion of image motif and racing car creates art on wheels.For the design of the 20th BMW Art Car, Julie Mehretu uses the colour and form vocabulary of an existing large-format painting from a more recent series of works: obscured photographs, dotted grids, neon-coloured spray paint and Mehretu's iconic gestural markings give her design an abstract visual form. She transfers the resulting image motif as a high-resolution photograph onto the vehicle's contours using a 3D mapping technique. This creates the unique artistic foiling with which the BMW M Hybrid V8 will compete in the Le Mans race. Mehretu on her process: \"It wasn't until after going to the 24 Hours race in Daytona last year that the idea of how to approach the BMW Art Car really crystallised. I was thinking about Frank Stella's grid and how this could also be a shout-out to former BMW Art Car artists. And I kept thinking of this painting in my studio that I had just finished and the model of the Art Car was in my studio and I thought maybe we can try to have the car move through this painting.\"\n\nFor the first time, Julie Mehretu, whose work will be presented this year within a major retrospective at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice from March 17, is working with BMW on a three-dimensional format. The interplay of the surfaces and geometry of the vehicle creates a remix of elements of her painting and opens up new perspectives for the artist in her creative process. \"The creative play of what you can do in this new three-dimensional space and how many imaginations and inventions are played out to build it is highly instructive. It is not just the car itself but the designers and their deliberations as well as and foremost the drivers and their desires and aspirations which make it become this place of dreams where painting, conceptual art, aerodynamics, speed and aesthetics can participate,” says Mehretu.\n\nIn accordance with the regulations of the FIA, the 3D version of the artwork can only be applied to the BMW M Hybrid V8 with a film wrap. For this, Julie Mehretu is working closely with the German Race Spirit team led by Manuel Eberl and Gertraud Brenninger to design the 20th BMW Art Car. Race Spirit was already involved in realising the design created by Jeff Koons for the 17th BMW Art Car.\n\nFrom the museum to the race track - and back again.In keeping with the long tradition of the BMW Art Car Collection, the artistically designed vehicle will be presented to the public for the first time in an internationally renowned museum on May 21. As with the world premieres of the BMW Art Cars by Roy Lichtenstein (1977) and Jeff Koons (2010), the unveiling will take place at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. That same week, the artwork will be part of the program of the Concorso d'Eleganza at the Villa d'Este in Cernobbio (May 24-26).\n\nThe close connection between art and motorsport is also an integral part of the history of the BMW Art Car Collection. The very first BMW Art Car, designed by Alexander Calder in 1975, made its dynamic debut at the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans. As the 20th BMW Art Car, Julie Mehretu's vehicle will compete at Le Mans with starting number 20 and will be driven by BMW works drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Robin Frijns (NED) and René Rast (GER) in the 24 Hours of Le Mans from June 15 to 16, 2024. The artist will also design the racing suits in which they will compete at Le Mans.\n\n\"The prospect of competing in a BMW Art Car at the 24 Hours of Le Mans is an additional incentive for the entire M Motorsport team to prepare the BMW M Hybrid V8 as perfectly as possible for this big stage,\" says Franciscus van Meel, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW M GmbH. \"In the 100th year of the race's existence and 25 years after BMW's last victory at Le Mans, winning there with a BMW Art Car would be the greatest possible success for all of us.”\n\nFollowing its race at Le Mans, the 20th BMW Art Car will also become an exhibit that will be presented to the public in museums and on art platforms worldwide. However, Julie Mehretu's approach goes far beyond the vehicle as a stand-alone artistic work.\n\nWorkshops with young creatives in numerous African cities.A central component of the project is the PanAfricanTranslocal Media Workshop Series on the African continent, which will continue the collaboration between Julie Mehretu and BMW in 2025. Together with Mehret Mandefro, Emmy-nominated producer, writer and co-founder of the Realness Institute, which works to strengthen the media ecosystem across Africa, the artist will host workshops in eight African cities over the course of nine months to provide artists with a space for encounters, exchange and collaboration. The results of the workshops will then be presented at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town – together with the 20th BMW Art Car. An important partner for the conception of the programme is the artist residency Denniston Hill in Upstate New York, founded in 2004 by Julie Mehretu, Lawrence Chua and Paul Pfeiffer.\n\nJulie Mehretu was unanimously chosen to design the 20th BMW Art Car in 2018 by a jury of high-ranking representatives of the international art world.

Race Spirit was already involved in realising the design created by Jeff Koons for the 17th BMW Art Car.\n\nFrom the museum to the race track - and back again.In keeping with the long tradition of the BMW Art Car Collection, the artistically designed vehicle will be presented to the public for the first time in an internationally renowned museum on May 21. As with the world premieres of the BMW Art Cars by Roy Lichtenstein (1977) and Jeff Koons (2010), the unveiling will take place at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. That same week, the artwork will be part of the program of the Concorso d'Eleganza at the Villa d'Este in Cernobbio (May 24-26).\n\nThe close connection between art and motorsport is also an integral part of the history of the BMW Art Car Collection. The very first BMW Art Car, designed by Alexander Calder in 1975, made its dynamic debut at the Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans. As the 20th BMW Art Car, Julie Mehretu's vehicle will compete at Le Mans with starting number 20 and will be driven by BMW works drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Robin Frijns (NED) and René Rast (GER) in the 24 Hours of Le Mans from June 15 to 16, 2024. The artist will also design the racing suits in which they will compete at Le Mans.\n\n\"The prospect of competing in a BMW Art Car at the 24 Hours of Le Mans is an additional incentive for the entire M Motorsport team to prepare the BMW M Hybrid V8 as perfectly as possible for this big stage,\" says Franciscus van Meel, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW M GmbH. \"In the 100th year of the race's existence and 25 years after BMW's last victory at Le Mans, winning there with a BMW Art Car would be the greatest possible success for all of us.”\n\nFollowing its race at Le Mans, the 20th BMW Art Car will also become an exhibit that will be presented to the public in museums and on art platforms worldwide. However, Julie Mehretu's approach goes far beyond the vehicle as a stand-alone artistic work.\n\nWorkshops with young creatives in numerous African cities.A central component of the project is the PanAfricanTranslocal Media Workshop Series on the African continent, which will continue the collaboration between Julie Mehretu and BMW in 2025. Together with Mehret Mandefro, Emmy-nominated producer, writer and co-founder of the Realness Institute, which works to strengthen the media ecosystem across Africa, the artist will host workshops in eight African cities over the course of nine months to provide artists with a space for encounters, exchange and collaboration. The results of the workshops will then be presented at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town – together with the 20th BMW Art Car. An important partner for the conception of the programme is the artist residency Denniston Hill in Upstate New York, founded in 2004 by Julie Mehretu, Lawrence Chua and Paul Pfeiffer.\n\nJulie Mehretu was unanimously chosen to design the 20th BMW Art Car in 2018 by a jury of high-ranking representatives of the international art world. The panel includes renowned curators and museum directors from various countries, including Koyo Kouoh, Executive Director and Chief Curator, Zeitz MOCAA, Cape Town; Hans-Ulrich Obrist, Artistic Director of the Serpentine Galleries, London; and Cecilia Alemani, Donald R. Mullen, Jr. Director and Chief Curator, High Line Art, New York. Like all the artists involved in the creation of the BMW Art Car Collection since 1975 – including Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, César Manrique, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Cao Fei and John Baldessari, in addition to those already mentioned – Julie Mehretu was given unrestricted creative freedom in the realization of her ideas for the latest vehicle of this globally unique collection.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

And if these rocks could speak, they would whisper of ancient winds and timeless suns. Of shadows stretching long across the desert’s canvas. Like giants frozen in a dance, their granite domes painted in hues of gold and crimson revealing the earth's very bones. Her great ribs of stone, piercing the sky and breathing secrets of a time before time.\n\nThis imagery perfectly captured the scene that greeted the riders on the morning of the 3rd day of the BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy in Namibia. Bathed in the soft glow of dawn, the rocks stood like an ancient Greek-Roman sculpture—Nature’s masterpiece, with layers of stone draped over each other like a blanket. It was a visual feast for the riders, a brief moment of stillness and admiration before they tackled the day’s first Special Challenge, set right next to the campground.\n\nDay 3, Special Challenge 1: The Spitzkoppe INSTA360 Challenge. Equipped with only a sheet of instructions and a compass, the riders set off on foot to find a hidden GS Trophy wooden board in the rugged terrain around Spitzkoppe. They had five steps to follow, navigating the rocky landscape to reach their target, then take a selfie with the board and return to the starting point—all while racing against the clock. With an Insta360 camera capturing their every move, the riders dashed over rocks and through narrow paths, eyes scanning the terrain for clues. The challenge tested their navigation skills, sense of direction, and quick thinking, all under the pressure of time.\n\nRider Scott Acheson (133) of Team USA mentioned, “This exercise was great! It helped that I grew up without GPS and modern navigation systems. My Marine Corps Training paid off.”\n\nAfter leaving Spitzkoppe, the riders pushed north, winding through farmlands where the scenery seemed almost to shift with each passing moment. Suddenly, as if an invisible line had been drawn in the sand, the fields gave way to the vast, empty expanse of the desert. It was as if someone had declared, “From here, it's farmlands; beyond, only the desert.”\n\nRiding through this stark boundary, the riders witnessed the incredible perseverance of nature - several places where, centuries ago, small creeks once meandered, leaving behind a trace of life in the form of sparse vegetation struggling against the arid land. Soon, the riders reached the location for the second Special Challenge of the day.\n\nDay 3, Special Challenge 2: The Camel Thorn Tree Challenge. In this challenge, the riders needed to prove their quick thinking and teamwork by demonstrating how to plug a tire under time pressure. As soon as they left the start line, one rider jumped on their bike and raced over to the disabled motorcycle, while another took off on foot to join them. The third rider grabbed the toolkit and hurried to meet the others. Once all three riders reached the disabled bike, the task was clear: work together to plug the tire as quickly as possible. With hands moving swiftly and focus sharpened, they would patch up the tire, bringing the challenge to a close.\n\nRider JP Boer (232) of Team South Africa said: “We had a very good time. There were no hick-ups, and our tactic was very straightforward: as fast as possible. All of our riders are pretty comfortable with these kinds of challenges.”\n\nAs the riders continued their journey, they entered the now-dry Omaruru River, one of Namibia's ephemeral rivers, which carved a natural corridor of life through the arid landscape. The dry riverbed stretched before them, lined with ancient Camelthorn and Ana trees that offered shelter and food to desert-adapted wildlife like kudu, oryx, and baboons. Even in its dry state, the Omaruru River told stories of nature's untamed power, its flow capable of surging unexpectedly during the rainy season, reshaping the desert floor with each passing year.\n\nThe rocky canyon’s terrain became even more challenging. Its walls, painted in every conceivable shade of grey and brown, seemed like a masterpiece etched by time. The path narrowed and widened, sometimes only a few meters across, then opening up to a width of nearly 100 meters. Riding through the deep sand that filled the canyon floor, every twist and turn became a test of skill and concentration.\n\nWith the sun directly overhead, the midday light cast no shadows, flattening the landscape and hiding the road’s many dips and ridges, making the ride even trickier. The color variations in the canyon’s layered walls hinted at the slow, powerful movements of the Earth's crust, a silent reminder of the planet's ancient and ongoing transformations. However, it was the perfect opportunity for the participants to complete the additional Special Challenge of the day, the Photo Challenge.\n\nPushing through these challenges, the riders made their way toward the lunch break, a well-deserved rest after a morning of relentless terrain and unforgiving heat.\n\nOnly a few kilometers from the lunch break, the riders came across the third special challenge of the day.\n\nDay 3, Special Challenge 3: The Omaruru METZELER Challenge. This time, all three riders lined up, ready to tackle the course in relay style. Rider one set off first, navigating through a winding course, circling around the flag, then up and over a rock before making the return trip through the exit gates back to the start. Once back, he high-fived the second rider, who immediately set off to repeat the course. The process continued as the second rider returned to high-five the third rider, who then completed the course. The challenge was all about speed, precision, and teamwork—the clock only stopped once the third rider crossed the finish line and returned to the start.\n\nRider Stephan Sleeckx (142) of Team Benelux, said: “It was very demanding, and the sand was very deep, but it actually went well. I only had one dab, and my team member had one drop, but it went very good. It was a fast challenge but very dusty.”\n\nOn their way back to the Spitzkoppe Camp, the riders were treated to a breathtaking view of the distant Brandberg Mountain, its outline barely visible on the horizon. Known for the ancient White Lady painting found in its caves, Brandberg is a place rich in history and once the site of a mining town that extracted tin from its depths.\n\nThe return trail offered a welcome respite from the relentless sand earlier in the day. The hard-packed track, interspersed with rocky sections, provided a smoother ride, allowing the riders to catch their breath and enjoy the changing scenery. The terrain continued to surprise with its diversity; small volcanic rocks appeared on the sides of the track, seemingly placed with purpose, evenly scattered like stones in a Zen Garden.\n\nAs they neared their destination, the majestic Spitzkoppe rock formation emerged on the horizon. Towering over the landscape like the tallest building in a quiet village, it beckoned its residents home.\n\nThe day ended with the announcement of the results and a teaser video for Day 4 of the GS Trophy, leaving the riders eagerly anticipating the challenges to come.\n\nRider Dmytro Ivanov (251), International Male Team: “This was an amazing ride on the sand! Perfect conditions, and I love riding in the sand. You don’t know what life will bring tomorrow. So, we must live today. And today, I wanted to ride sand!”\n\nRider Dake Zue (191), Team China: “It was very challenging. We have no issues with sand, but it was a very long sand trail, almost 50 kilometers, and that made things harder for us.”\n\nRider Andrea Gioia (151), Team Italy: “I really enjoyed the sand. My dad, Massimo (Rider 152), is better, and I had to learn from him when I was younger. So I had a great teacher.”\n\nBMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2024, Namibia.\n\nDay Three overall standings:\n\n1. Germany, 127 points\n\n3. International Team, 88\n\n13.

And if these rocks could speak, they would whisper of ancient winds and timeless suns. Of shadows stretching long across the desert’s canvas. Like giants frozen in a dance, their granite domes painted in hues of gold and crimson revealing the earth's very bones. Her great ribs of stone, piercing the sky and breathing secrets of a time before time.\n\nThis imagery perfectly captured the scene that greeted the riders on the morning of the 3rd day of the BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy in Namibia. Bathed in the soft glow of dawn, the rocks stood like an ancient Greek-Roman sculpture—Nature’s masterpiece, with layers of stone draped over each other like a blanket. It was a visual feast for the riders, a brief moment of stillness and admiration before they tackled the day’s first Special Challenge, set right next to the campground.\n\nDay 3, Special Challenge 1: The Spitzkoppe INSTA360 Challenge. Equipped with only a sheet of instructions and a compass, the riders set off on foot to find a hidden GS Trophy wooden board in the rugged terrain around Spitzkoppe. They had five steps to follow, navigating the rocky landscape to reach their target, then take a selfie with the board and return to the starting point—all while racing against the clock. With an Insta360 camera capturing their every move, the riders dashed over rocks and through narrow paths, eyes scanning the terrain for clues. The challenge tested their navigation skills, sense of direction, and quick thinking, all under the pressure of time.\n\nRider Scott Acheson (133) of Team USA mentioned, “This exercise was great! It helped that I grew up without GPS and modern navigation systems. My Marine Corps Training paid off.”\n\nAfter leaving Spitzkoppe, the riders pushed north, winding through farmlands where the scenery seemed almost to shift with each passing moment. Suddenly, as if an invisible line had been drawn in the sand, the fields gave way to the vast, empty expanse of the desert. It was as if someone had declared, “From here, it's farmlands; beyond, only the desert.”\n\nRiding through this stark boundary, the riders witnessed the incredible perseverance of nature - several places where, centuries ago, small creeks once meandered, leaving behind a trace of life in the form of sparse vegetation struggling against the arid land. Soon, the riders reached the location for the second Special Challenge of the day.\n\nDay 3, Special Challenge 2: The Camel Thorn Tree Challenge. In this challenge, the riders needed to prove their quick thinking and teamwork by demonstrating how to plug a tire under time pressure. As soon as they left the start line, one rider jumped on their bike and raced over to the disabled motorcycle, while another took off on foot to join them. The third rider grabbed the toolkit and hurried to meet the others. Once all three riders reached the disabled bike, the task was clear: work together to plug the tire as quickly as possible. With hands moving swiftly and focus sharpened, they would patch up the tire, bringing the challenge to a close.\n\nRider JP Boer (232) of Team South Africa said: “We had a very good time. There were no hick-ups, and our tactic was very straightforward: as fast as possible. All of our riders are pretty comfortable with these kinds of challenges.”\n\nAs the riders continued their journey, they entered the now-dry Omaruru River, one of Namibia's ephemeral rivers, which carved a natural corridor of life through the arid landscape. The dry riverbed stretched before them, lined with ancient Camelthorn and Ana trees that offered shelter and food to desert-adapted wildlife like kudu, oryx, and baboons. Even in its dry state, the Omaruru River told stories of nature's untamed power, its flow capable of surging unexpectedly during the rainy season, reshaping the desert floor with each passing year.\n\nThe rocky canyon’s terrain became even more challenging.

For more than 23 hours, BMW M Team RLL and Paul Miller Racing had their sights set on victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), but a dramatic final stage dashed all hopes of a well-deserved reward for a great performance by BMW M Motorsport at the season opener of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC). Dries Vanthoor (BEL), who had secured pole position in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8, collided with a competitor while fighting for second place and fell to fourth place due to the subsequent repairs. A similar fate befell Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) in the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, who was also contending for the win but ultimately had to settle for fourth position in the GTD-PRO class after an incident.\n\nDespite the disappointment over the frustrating final stage of the race, BMW M Motorsport looks back on a very strong race weekend at Daytona. Both the BMW M Hybrid V8 and the BMW M4 GT3 EVO demonstrated their enormous potential and made a significant impact on the track. Vanthoor, starting as the lead driver for the #24 from pole position – the first for BMW M Motorsport's LMDh project – built a 25-second lead in his first double-stint. Although this was levelled by numerous yellow flag periods, it underscored the strength of the vehicle. The same applies to the fastest race lap, which Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) drove in 1:35.868 minutes in the #25 BMW M Hybrid V8 which also showed impressive speed but fell back due to several incidents, finishing in seventh place. Both BMW M Hybrid V8s had no technical issues.\n\nIn the GTD-PRO class, Paul Miller Racing played several leading roles. The #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO led the race into the evening but was then hit by an opponent in a mass collision. The heavily damaged vehicle was repaired thanks to the great efforts of the mechanics but lost many laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth place. The sister #1 car stepped up, moved up from its 13th starting position, and fought for the win until just before the end. Kelvin van der Linde had the podium in sight at his race debut for BMW M Motorsport until he was forced into a spin by an opponent and fell back to fourth place.

With 50 minutes left, we were in the fight for the win in all categories. Everyone could see how fast and reliable our car is. The drivers and the teams did a great job and made no mistakes. But that's racing.\"\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “A big thank you to the entire team. Unfortunately, we had a weekend of ups and downs. If we only look at the race results, we cannot be satisfied with the fourth places in the GTP and GTD PRO classes. We started the weekend well, achieving very good results in both the free practice sessions and in qualifying – with Dries Vanthoor on pole position (GTP) and Dan Harper in third place (GTD PRO). That was very promising. For much of the race, we were able to compete for class victories and even the overall win. That's the positive we want to take with us. When you fight for the top positions in a 24-hour race for so long though, it is ultimately sad and disappointing for the teams and drivers who have invested a lot of work to get there - it would have been deserved to win at least one, if not the winner's trophy. Nevertheless, we must take the positives: the strong trend from 2024 clearly continues, we were able to build on it and field a competitive car in the GTP class here. The BMW M4 GT3 EVO has also shown in its third race that it can compete against the toughest competition – also in IMSA.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 4th place): “I want to say a massive congratulations to my brother. If there is someone who should win the race if it is not me then it is my brother. He has had a good time in the last couple of races and seasons and I am very happy for him. I for sure am very gutted with this result. We showed a great pace and that the car is capable of doing it. Obviously finishing in P4 in a 24 hour race is not the end of the world, but at the end of the day it is very sad to fight for 22 hours and not come home with a podium, which we for sure deserved. I feel sorry for the guys, who have been working very hard and also to my teammates. I would have loved to gift them with something, but most important is that we showed that we were strong and able to fight. We will make sure to come back and we will win this race.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 7th place): “It was a very disappointing ending to the race for us. We had a very good package to fight for the win, which we showed all week long so we were quite positive heading into the race. Unfortunately we had a small issue in the pit stop with the brake change. That cost us three laps and we never really manage to make it back again. Obviously that was not the reward we wanted to give all the guys for the hard work all over the winter trying to make sure we have a fast car that is able to fight for the win. But we will definitely take a lot of notes from the race weekend, try to improve for Sebring and really bring that podium home.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 4th place GTD PRO): “It is a proud moment for me, fighting the whole race for the win. It was a good mileage for me, learning the car for the first time. To narrowly have missed out on the win is more than I could have ever expected. It was unfortunate as we led the race for the last two hours. The last pit stop was where we unfortunately lost track position and we weren’t really able to overtake looking forward. The rest is history. We will come back and try again next time.”\n\nMax Hesse (# 48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO):\n\n“First of all, I would like to express a huge thank you to BMW M Motorsport and Paul Miller Racing. It was the first time I was able to start here. It's a very cool event and it remains my dream to win here someday. This year, we definitely had the package to do it. Unfortunately, we were involved in a big crash, which was not our fault. I was very well warned by my team, but unfortunately, our competitors behind us were not. That's part of it. Our car ran great. The mechanics did a top job getting us back on track. I think we've gained good experience for Sebring - and there we'll try to go full attack again.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 12th place GTD PRO): “The situation with the Corvette and our sister car was very difficult. My intention was to support my teammate in the sister car in the fight for victory. I was aware that it was hard racing. The situation that led to the collision between the Corvette and Connor De Phillippi behind me was very unfortunate – but I had nothing to do with it directly. I stayed on my inside line.”\n\nJens Klingmann (#96 BMW M4 GT 3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 5th place GTD):\n\n“Looking solely at the result, fifth place for Turner Motorsport was the best 24-hour race at Daytona. On the other hand, we entered to win. Therefore, we are very frustrated. Half an hour before the end of the race, we were in second place and had done many things right up to that point. When you then finish in fifth place, at first glance you tend to see the negatives, but we gave it our all, and that was the maximum we could achieve with the overall package. I am still proud that after the BMW M4 GT3 was already capable of winning in its first two dress rehearsals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we also had the cars in the lead for a long time here and once again proved that the car has the potential to win races. This gives me a positive outlook; we will take this experience home, continue working, and then I think it will still be a very successful season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For more than 23 hours, BMW M Team RLL and Paul Miller Racing had their sights set on victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), but a dramatic final stage dashed all hopes of a well-deserved reward for a great performance by BMW M Motorsport at the season opener of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IWSC)."}]}

I am still proud that after the BMW M4 GT3 was already capable of winning in its first two dress rehearsals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, we also had the cars in the lead for a long time here and once again proved that the car has the potential to win races. This gives me a positive outlook; we will take this experience home, continue working, and then I think it will still be a very successful season.”"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

Hydrogen as a sustainable source of energy and movement is the central theme of BMW's program at this year's Art Basel in Basel. BMW, which has been a partner of Art Basel for 20 years, has commissioned London-based artist Es Devlin to create a series of multi-media works which will be unveiled on 10 June. In Hall 1.1 of the art fair Devlin has created a booth displaying four works: Surfacing (2024), Surfacing II (2024), Mask (2018), and Mask in Motion (2018). As an opening chapter, Devlin and BMW also present a series of mobile sound installations within a pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles* which have been enveloped in prints of Devlin’s collaged paintings. Passengers are invited to listen in on the artist’s conversation with BMW engineers about the potential of hydrogen.\n\n“The works on innovation and mobility created by Es Devlin for Art Basel offer an impressive example of how technology can serve as inspiration for art,” says Michael Rath, Head of Hydrogen Vehicles, BMW Group. “We are very proud of the radiance of the BMW Group's pioneering hydrogen technology.”\n\nThe BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Pioneer and trailblazer of BMW’s technological expertise.As a versatile energy source, hydrogen will play a key role in the energy transition and thus in climate protection. The BMW iX5 Hydrogen combines the advantages of locally emission-free electric drive with the driving pleasure typical of the brand. Another advantage: the quick and uncomplicated refuelling process. The company is currently testing the vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology in selected countries under everyday conditions. The world tour of the pilot fleet will now make a stop at Art Basel 2024, where the innovative hydrogen vehicles will be available as a shuttle service.\n\nFor the BMW Group, the pilot project is an expression of its open-technology approach to the mobility of tomorrow. The hydrogen fuel cell technology provides an additional supplement to battery-electric drive systems.\n\nThe powertrain of the vehicle developed on the basis of the BMW X5 consists of an innovative combination of fuel cells with an output of 125 kW/170 hp, which uses energy from gaseous hydrogen to drive an electric motor from the BMW Group's Gen 5 programme together with a specially developed battery. This generates a maximum system output of 285 kW/401 hp. The hydrogen tanks of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen can be refuelled within three to four minutes and enable a range of 504 kilometres according to the WLTP test cycle.\n\nEs Devlin to create a series of multi-media works which will be unveiled on 10 June at Art Basel in Basel 2024.In Hall 1.1 of the art fair Devlin has created a booth displaying four works: Surfacing (2024), an illuminated cube of rain penetrated by a line of light and Surfacing II (2024), a pair of painted televisions in which a dancing figure appears to displace pixels and pigment, are flanked by Mask (2018) a projection-mapped model city fusing hands and river, and Mask in Motion (2018) a revolving illuminated translucent printed city which meshes viewers within its kinetic shadow.\n\nEach work continues Devlin's 30 year exploration of the entangled dance between humans and technology. The booth surprises visitors each hour as Surfacing's box of rain, like a magician's apparatus, conjures a 7 minute dance work by renowned Paris-based choreographer Sharon Eyal with music composed by London-based duo Polyphonia.\n\nA meeting of artist and engineers.Devlin has spent the past year engaging with engineers at BMW, learning the mechanics behind the hydrogen fuel cell technology and its implications for the future of sustainable energy systems. As an opening chapter to the works on view in Hall 1.1, she has created a simple soundscape drawn from their conversations and underscored by composers Polyphonia which is played to guests in the pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles.\n\nDevlin says: “I learned from the BMW engineers the beautiful symmetry of the system at work within the hydrogen fuel cell: the energy that is used to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen is recreated when the oxygen is reunited with hydrogen within the car. The by-product is not only the energy which propels the vehicle, but water.”\n\nThe exterior of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen has been wrapped in a painted blue and white collage in which Devlin overlays paintings and text made in response to the prints and literature which populated her wall and bookshelves as a teenager. Painted gestures echoing the 1831 woodcut ‘The Great Wave off Kanagawa’ by Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, are superimposed over hand written extracts from literature’s longest sentence about water drawn from James Joyce’s seminal novel ‘Ulysses’.

Hydrogen as a sustainable source of energy and movement is the central theme of BMW's program at this year's Art Basel in Basel. BMW, which has been a partner of Art Basel for 20 years, has commissioned London-based artist Es Devlin to create a series of multi-media works which will be unveiled on 10 June. In Hall 1.1 of the art fair Devlin has created a booth displaying four works: Surfacing (2024), Surfacing II (2024), Mask (2018), and Mask in Motion (2018). As an opening chapter, Devlin and BMW also present a series of mobile sound installations within a pilot fleet of BMW iX5 Hydrogen vehicles* which have been enveloped in prints of Devlin’s collaged paintings. Passengers are invited to listen in on the artist’s conversation with BMW engineers about the potential of hydrogen.\n\n“The works on innovation and mobility created by Es Devlin for Art Basel offer an impressive example of how technology can serve as inspiration for art,” says Michael Rath, Head of Hydrogen Vehicles, BMW Group. “We are very proud of the radiance of the BMW Group's pioneering hydrogen technology.”\n\nThe BMW iX5 Hydrogen: Pioneer and trailblazer of BMW’s technological expertise.As a versatile energy source, hydrogen will play a key role in the energy transition and thus in climate protection. The BMW iX5 Hydrogen combines the advantages of locally emission-free electric drive with the driving pleasure typical of the brand. Another advantage: the quick and uncomplicated refuelling process. The company is currently testing the vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology in selected countries under everyday conditions. The world tour of the pilot fleet will now make a stop at Art Basel 2024, where the innovative hydrogen vehicles will be available as a shuttle service.\n\nFor the BMW Group, the pilot project is an expression of its open-technology approach to the mobility of tomorrow. The hydrogen fuel cell technology provides an additional supplement to battery-electric drive systems.\n\nThe powertrain of the vehicle developed on the basis of the BMW X5 consists of an innovative combination of fuel cells with an output of 125 kW/170 hp, which uses energy from gaseous hydrogen to drive an electric motor from the BMW Group's Gen 5 programme together with a specially developed battery. This generates a maximum system output of 285 kW/401 hp. The hydrogen tanks of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen can be refuelled within three to four minutes and enable a range of 504 kilometres according to the WLTP test cycle.\n\nEs Devlin to create a series of multi-media works which will be unveiled on 10 June at Art Basel in Basel 2024.In Hall 1.1 of the art fair Devlin has created a booth displaying four works: Surfacing (2024), an illuminated cube of rain penetrated by a line of light and Surfacing II (2024), a pair of painted televisions in which a dancing figure appears to displace pixels and pigment, are flanked by Mask (2018) a projection-mapped model city fusing hands and river, and Mask in Motion (2018) a revolving illuminated translucent printed city which meshes viewers within its kinetic shadow.\n\nEach work continues Devlin's 30 year exploration of the entangled dance between humans and technology.

The third race weekend of the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS Sprint Cup could hardly have gone better for the BMW M Motorsport teams. Dries Vanthoor and Charles Weerts (BEL) climbed onto the podium twice at the Hockenheimring (GER) in the BMW M Team WRT #32 BMW M4 GT3 and lead both the overall standings and the Sprint Cup of the GT World Challenge Europe. In the Silver Cup, Calan Williams (AUS) and Sam De Haan (GBR) celebrated a class win and a second place.

On Sunday, Vanthoor placed the #32 BMW M4 GT3 third on the grid, and, although the car's speed was not quite as good as the day before in hot temperatures, the WRT duo managed to fight for another second place. Thanks to these strong results, Vanthoor and Weerts lead both the overall GT World Challenge Europe standings, which include both endurance and sprint races, as well as the sprint classification. In both team classifications, WRT is at the top.\n\nThe Belgian team also had plenty of reasons to celebrate in the Silver Cup. Williams and De Haan won the Sunday race in Hockenheim in their class in the #30 BMW M4 GT3 and finished second on Saturday. At the same time, they took excellent fifth places in the overall classifications, further extending their already clear lead for the drivers and team in the Sprint Cup standings. In the Bronze Cup, Harper and Leung shone with two class wins in the Century Motorsport Team #991 BMW M4 GT3. They also lead the Sprint Cup drivers' standings in their class, as does Century Motorsport in the team standings.\n\nComments after the races:\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “That was a very positive weekend. A double podium in both classes, and on top of that a victory for Calan Williams and Sam De Haan – that's a great success. We regained the lead in the overall Sprint Cup standings with Dries Vanthoor and Charles Weerts on Sunday, which, of course, makes us happy. I would like to highlight once again the performance of our crews during the pit stops, which gained us several places on Saturday, but also on Sunday.”\n\nDries Vanthoor (#32 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT): “It was a very good weekend for us – better than we expected. We worked well as a team and made the right adjustments over the weekend. Going into the summer leading the Sprint Cup standings gives us a good feeling. But afterwards, we have to keep pushing just as hard.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3, BMW M Team WRT): “After the problems we faced in the first qualifying, we can be very satisfied with the outcome of the weekend and the lead in the overall standings. In Saturday's race I had a lot of fun when I was able to make up 13 positions during my stint. On Sunday we were a bit more on the defensive in terms of speed, but we defended our second place well. Many thanks to the team and to Dries for a great weekend.”\n\nDan Harper (#991 BMW M4 GT3, Century Motorsport): “A great job by the entire team with the two class wins this weekend.

The 2025 season opener of the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) will go down as one of the most dramatic 24-hour races in history. From start to finish, persistent rain during the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) created extremely treacherous conditions. In this eventful endurance marathon, the BMW teams demonstrated the potential of the BMW M 1000 RR. The private team ERC Endurance #6 celebrated a podium finish with third place. The factory team, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team (#37), was also among the top favourites and crossed the line in fourth place after 24 turbulent hours.\n\nAfter dry weather up until Friday, rain began right on schedule on race day Saturday. The track became extremely slippery, resulting in numerous crashes throughout the field. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with factory riders Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), Markus Reiterberger (GER), Steven Odendaal (GER), and reserve rider Hannes Soomer (EST) was not spared. The #37 BMW M 1000 RR led the field with a solid advantage during the chaotic early stages but over the following hours, the team – like nearly all others – suffered crashes and had to take a lengthy repair break. Nevertheless, Guintoli, Reiterberger, and Odendaal fought their way back, keeping their podium hopes alive.\n\nBMW Motorrad Motorsport was represented on the Le Mans podium by ERC Endurance #6, with riders Kenny Foray (FRA), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), and David Checa (ESP). The trio showed strong pace throughout race week with their #6 BMW M 1000 RR and rewarded themselves with third place.\n\nIn addition to these teams, four other private BMW squads competed at Le Mans. In the Superstock class, Team Étoile from Japan narrowly missed the podium, finishing fourth. On the #25 BMW M 1000 RR, riders Hikari Okubo, Kazuki Watanabe, and Motoharu Ito (all JPN) shared duties. The Hungarian Endurance Racing Team by Moto Jungle claimed the celebrated pole position in the Superstock class with the #713 BMW M 1000 RR. However, the race also proved to be eventful for this Hungarian trio – Bálint Kovács, Máté Számado, and Soma Görbe. On Sunday morning, the #713 had to head into the pits but returned to the track for the final lap, crossing the finish line to the cheers of the team. Team LRP Poland, with riders Danny Webb, Michael Dunlop (both GBR), and Enzo Boulom (FRA) on the #90 BMW M 1000 RR, was forced to retire late in the evening. The French team T2C Racing (#2 BMW S 1000 RR) also retired early in the evening.\n\nThe second race of the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship, the 8 Hours of Spa Motos at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), will take place on June 7.\n\nReactions after the 24h Le Mans:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This 24-hour race is one we’ll all remember for a long time. The challenge of riding a race like Le Mans under such conditions was immense for everyone involved. That makes the strong performance of the BMW teams and riders all the more impressive. Congratulations to the entire ERC Endurance #6 team who managed to reach the podium in their first race in this lineup. Our factory team also proved its podium potential right to the very end. Many thanks to the team and the riders for their hard work and strong performance. What we saw at Le Mans gives us a lot of confidence for the rest of the FIM EWC season.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an absolutely emotional experience all around. Le Mans is always impressive, and endurance racing is full of passion. I think that passion was evident from the first to the last lap. The riders had to take big risks in extremely difficult conditions. By hour 22, there had already been more than 145 crashes – surely a record, but a sad one. Teams put in so much work and heart, and only a few got the reward. It was a real sporting challenge, and we’re very happy to have a BMW M 1000 RR on the podium. Congratulations to Uwe Reinhardt and the ERC crew. Our Werner Daemen-led factory team fought right to the last minute. We had crashes with all three riders; it was just that tough out there. Plus, we had a follow-up repair that cost us about 15 minutes, which was likely the small margin that kept us from the podium. We were a bit unlucky, but we’re happy with the many points we’re taking home. It’s a solid foundation for the rest of the season, and we’re looking forward to Spa, Werner Daemen’s home race. I think that track suits our BMW M 1000 RR well. You could already see its potential here.”\n\nKenny Foray, ERC Endurance #6: “The feeling is just incredible. It was an absolutely crazy race. I think it is not possible to imagine how we feel on the bike when you watch so many crashes like this. And when you go to your hospitality to take some rest and you see more crashes on TV, and you know that you soon have to be back on the bike again – this was really, really difficult. We had some problems but we did not crash, we stayed on the bike, and I think that was the key of the race. It is just an incredible moment. This is the first race for the team with the BMW M 1000 RR and we start with a podium. That is fantastic!”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik, ERC Endurance #6: “It feels nice because when you change the team you also want to have good results. Despite the fact that we did not ride or test a lot this winter we showed immediately, without any track time, our performance. It was great to be so competitive during the weekend and in the end, we were on the podium. I want to say a big thank you to BMW for the support and to Uwe Reinhardt, the Team Principal. It was a nice present for him and also for David, who has his birthday today.”\n\nDavid Checa, ERC Endurance #6: “First of all, I am so happy to ride with BMW. It was my first experience with them and I was so excited because the engine is incredible. It has a lot of power from first to sixth gear and the bike is so easy to ride compared to the others I rode before. I just need to understand how to manage it but Ilya and Kenny have a lot of experience. They help me a lot to learn this bike. Step by step I will get to their rhythm because at the moment I am not yet on the level of Kenny and Ilya but I did my best. We did not expect to be on the podium as we did not test, but sometimes it happens! I am so happy to be back with Kenny and to be on the Le Mans podium with him.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I’ve done a lot of 24-hour races, but I’ve never experienced one as chaotic and slippery as today. There were so many crashes, and unfortunately, we went down three times as well. My teammates did a fantastic job. They were both really fast at the beginning but each had a crash. I then tried to bring it home but also slipped once. We were definitely in the fight, but it just wasn’t meant to be. Finishing fourth is a bit frustrating because we really wanted and deserved that podium. But it's clear we have the potential and we can fight for wins. Big thanks to my teammates and the entire team. It was an amazing week!”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was mad. It was really frantic from the very start because the track was very, very slippery. The 24 hours started really well. In the first one and a half hours, I felt really good and was leading. Then I got caught up with a backmarker and unfortunately crashed. The team did a fantastic job to repair the bike – and then again after Steven’s crash. They were really, really on point. Unfortunately we lost a bit too much time with the damage on the bike but I think everybody can be really proud of what we did today. It just wasn’t to be but we had speed, we were leading for quite a while and we were strong. There are still a lot of positives to take from this weekend and I think we are all very much looking forward to the next rounds.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “To be honest, it has definitely been the most difficult race of my life. I’ve never had to experience such terrible conditions during the night and during the day. A wet track drying and a dry track getting wet again, but I think the team did really well. We had some really big crashes and the team prepared the bike phenomenally well to get it back to working order. I am really happy, it was just unfortunate. It would have been nice to end up on the podium after all the troubles we had.”\n\nQualifying (combined).\n\nTati Team AVA6 Racing\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nCurrent World Championship standings (R01/04).\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 2025 season opener of the FIM EWC will go down as one of the most dramatic 24-hour races in history.

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team with factory riders Sylvain Guintoli (FRA), Markus Reiterberger (GER), Steven Odendaal (GER), and reserve rider Hannes Soomer (EST) was not spared. The #37 BMW M 1000 RR led the field with a solid advantage during the chaotic early stages but over the following hours, the team – like nearly all others – suffered crashes and had to take a lengthy repair break. Nevertheless, Guintoli, Reiterberger, and Odendaal fought their way back, keeping their podium hopes alive.\n\nBMW Motorrad Motorsport was represented on the Le Mans podium by ERC Endurance #6, with riders Kenny Foray (FRA), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), and David Checa (ESP). The trio showed strong pace throughout race week with their #6 BMW M 1000 RR and rewarded themselves with third place.\n\nIn addition to these teams, four other private BMW squads competed at Le Mans. In the Superstock class, Team Étoile from Japan narrowly missed the podium, finishing fourth. On the #25 BMW M 1000 RR, riders Hikari Okubo, Kazuki Watanabe, and Motoharu Ito (all JPN) shared duties. The Hungarian Endurance Racing Team by Moto Jungle claimed the celebrated pole position in the Superstock class with the #713 BMW M 1000 RR. However, the race also proved to be eventful for this Hungarian trio – Bálint Kovács, Máté Számado, and Soma Görbe. On Sunday morning, the #713 had to head into the pits but returned to the track for the final lap, crossing the finish line to the cheers of the team. Team LRP Poland, with riders Danny Webb, Michael Dunlop (both GBR), and Enzo Boulom (FRA) on the #90 BMW M 1000 RR, was forced to retire late in the evening. The French team T2C Racing (#2 BMW S 1000 RR) also retired early in the evening.\n\nThe second race of the 2025 FIM Endurance World Championship, the 8 Hours of Spa Motos at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), will take place on June 7.\n\nReactions after the 24h Le Mans:\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This 24-hour race is one we’ll all remember for a long time. The challenge of riding a race like Le Mans under such conditions was immense for everyone involved. That makes the strong performance of the BMW teams and riders all the more impressive. Congratulations to the entire ERC Endurance #6 team who managed to reach the podium in their first race in this lineup. Our factory team also proved its podium potential right to the very end. Many thanks to the team and the riders for their hard work and strong performance. What we saw at Le Mans gives us a lot of confidence for the rest of the FIM EWC season.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an absolutely emotional experience all around. Le Mans is always impressive, and endurance racing is full of passion. I think that passion was evident from the first to the last lap. The riders had to take big risks in extremely difficult conditions. By hour 22, there had already been more than 145 crashes – surely a record, but a sad one. Teams put in so much work and heart, and only a few got the reward. It was a real sporting challenge, and we’re very happy to have a BMW M 1000 RR on the podium. Congratulations to Uwe Reinhardt and the ERC crew. Our Werner Daemen-led factory team fought right to the last minute. We had crashes with all three riders; it was just that tough out there. Plus, we had a follow-up repair that cost us about 15 minutes, which was likely the small margin that kept us from the podium. We were a bit unlucky, but we’re happy with the many points we’re taking home. It’s a solid foundation for the rest of the season, and we’re looking forward to Spa, Werner Daemen’s home race. I think that track suits our BMW M 1000 RR well. You could already see its potential here.”\n\nKenny Foray, ERC Endurance #6: “The feeling is just incredible. It was an absolutely crazy race. I think it is not possible to imagine how we feel on the bike when you watch so many crashes like this. And when you go to your hospitality to take some rest and you see more crashes on TV, and you know that you soon have to be back on the bike again – this was really, really difficult. We had some problems but we did not crash, we stayed on the bike, and I think that was the key of the race. It is just an incredible moment. This is the first race for the team with the BMW M 1000 RR and we start with a podium. That is fantastic!”\n\nIlya Mikhalchik, ERC Endurance #6: “It feels nice because when you change the team you also want to have good results. Despite the fact that we did not ride or test a lot this winter we showed immediately, without any track time, our performance. It was great to be so competitive during the weekend and in the end, we were on the podium. I want to say a big thank you to BMW for the support and to Uwe Reinhardt, the Team Principal. It was a nice present for him and also for David, who has his birthday today.”\n\nDavid Checa, ERC Endurance #6: “First of all, I am so happy to ride with BMW. It was my first experience with them and I was so excited because the engine is incredible. It has a lot of power from first to sixth gear and the bike is so easy to ride compared to the others I rode before. I just need to understand how to manage it but Ilya and Kenny have a lot of experience. They help me a lot to learn this bike. Step by step I will get to their rhythm because at the moment I am not yet on the level of Kenny and Ilya but I did my best. We did not expect to be on the podium as we did not test, but sometimes it happens! I am so happy to be back with Kenny and to be on the Le Mans podium with him.”\n\nMarkus Reiterberger, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I’ve done a lot of 24-hour races, but I’ve never experienced one as chaotic and slippery as today. There were so many crashes, and unfortunately, we went down three times as well. My teammates did a fantastic job. They were both really fast at the beginning but each had a crash. I then tried to bring it home but also slipped once. We were definitely in the fight, but it just wasn’t meant to be. Finishing fourth is a bit frustrating because we really wanted and deserved that podium. But it's clear we have the potential and we can fight for wins. Big thanks to my teammates and the entire team. It was an amazing week!”\n\nSylvain Guintoli, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It was mad. It was really frantic from the very start because the track was very, very slippery. The 24 hours started really well. In the first one and a half hours, I felt really good and was leading. Then I got caught up with a backmarker and unfortunately crashed. The team did a fantastic job to repair the bike – and then again after Steven’s crash. They were really, really on point. Unfortunately we lost a bit too much time with the damage on the bike but I think everybody can be really proud of what we did today. It just wasn’t to be but we had speed, we were leading for quite a while and we were strong. There are still a lot of positives to take from this weekend and I think we are all very much looking forward to the next rounds.”\n\nSteven Odendaal, BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “To be honest, it has definitely been the most difficult race of my life. I’ve never had to experience such terrible conditions during the night and during the day. A wet track drying and a dry track getting wet again, but I think the team did really well. We had some really big crashes and the team prepared the bike phenomenally well to get it back to working order. I am really happy, it was just unfortunate. It would have been nice to end up on the podium after all the troubles we had.”\n\nQualifying (combined).\n\nTati Team AVA6 Racing\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team\n\nCurrent World Championship standings (R01/04).\n\nKawasaki Webike Trikstar\n\nBMW Motorrad World Endurance Team"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

This represents 17.4 percent of our total sales.\n\nOur electrified vehicles – in other words, BEVs, plus plug-in hybrids – accounted for almost 24 percent of total sales in the second quarter.\n\nSegment revenues increased slightly by 1.4 percent.\n\nAdjusted for currency translation effects, revenues saw an increase of 2.1 percent.\n\nThe significant growth in all-electric vehicles and models from the upper premium segment contributed to this. The current trend is also expected to have a positive effect on revenues for the remainder of 2024.\n\nRevenue per wholesale unit across the entire product portfolio is expected to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nEBIT for the period from April to June totalled 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe EBIT margin came in at 8.4 percent for the quarter and 8.6 percent for the half-year.\n\nExcluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the EBIT margin was 9.4 percent for the second quarter and 9.6 percent through six months.\n\nThat brings me to the EBIT bridge, to explain in more detail the changes in the operating result, compared to the second quarter of the previous year.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q2\n\nThe net balance of currency and commodity positions provided a tailwind of 500 million euros over last year’s second quarter.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nThis is expected to nearly offset material cost headwinds. However, we see additional requests for supply chain support.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model mix and pricing effects in the second quarter was about 300 million euros lower year-on-year.\n\nVolume development and the model mix made a positive contribution to this.\n\nThe global price environment for new and used cars continued to normalise in the second quarter.\n\nThe Chinese market, in particular, remains highly competitive.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect the net effect from volumes, model mix and prices to be neutral over last year.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by about 100 million euros compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe BMW Group's research and development expenditure remained at a high level through the end of June, totalling almost 4.2 billion euros.\n\nThe R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was at 5.7 percent after the first six months.\n\nThe capitalization ratio for development costs, which is relevant for R&D costs according to IFRS, was 34 percent in the second quarter and 30.8 percent as of June.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses increased by around 100 million euros compared to the previous year, primarily driven by personnel costs and expenses for IT projects.\n\nThe headwind of 200 million euros from Other Cost Changes can mainly be attributed to manufacturing costs. Here, inflation in material costs continues to have an impact.\n\nSLIDE 7: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q2\n\nFree cash flow in the Automotive Segment totalled 1 billion euros in the second quarter.\n\nThe change in working capital, amounting to 500 million euros, is largely due to the planned increase in inventory levels. This ensures we can continue to meet global demand for our products in the second half of the year.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 400 million euros in the second quarter.\n\nTotal investments for April to June amounted to around 2.6 billion euros.\n\nThe capex ratio came in at 5.8 percent for the second quarter and 4.7 percent for the half-year.\n\nAs in the previous years, the major share of capital expenditure will occur in the second half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter.\n\nWe expect a capex ratio of more than six percent for the full year.\n\nChanges to provisions positively impacted free cash flow in the second quarter by around 100 million euros.\n\nThe change in the position Other of around 800 million euros mainly reflects regular tax payments.\n\nAfter the first six months, Automotive Segment free cash flow had reached just over 2.3 billion euros.\n\nThe difference in free cashflow compared to 2023 is due to the capex increase of around 1 billion euros.\n\nWe expect to see a positive contribution from a reduction in working capital.\n\nFor the full year, we are targeting a free cash flow of over six billion euros.\n\nSince 2022, we have made a paradigm shift in our shareholder return strategy by adding a share buyback programme that supplements our annual dividend payout.\n\nIn doing so, we have increased the payout ratio of Automotive Free Cashflow by paying dividends in our target corridor of 30 to 40 percent as well as using the share buyback program.\n\nBMW AG is continuing with its share repurchase programme as planned. At the end of June, it had acquired shares equivalent to 5.51 percent of the existing share capital as of June 30th.\n\nThe second tranche of the second programme, totalling 500 million euros, was completed in June.\n\nThe third tranche of 500 million euros, which began in June, will be concluded no later than December 31st.\n\nBy the end of 2024, BMW AG will have repurchased shares valued at 1.5 billion euros as part of the second programme, which amounts to 2 billion euros.\n\nSLIDE 8: Net Financial Assets\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group has a solid and robust balance sheet, confirming the company's considerable financial strength.\n\nThis is also underscored by our net financial assets in the automotive business, which totalled just over 43 billion euros.\n\nStarting with the Half-Year Report 2024, we are changing the way we report net financial assets in our automotive business.\n\nIn addition to the Automotive Segment’s NFA that was previously reported, the new figure also includes the NFA of holding companies within the Other Entities Segment, which receive regular distributions from their subsidiaries.\n\nI trust that this new, comprehensive definition of Net Financial Assets provides you with useful additional information.\n\nSLIDE 9: Financial Services Segment in H1\n\nLet’s move on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nHere, the positive trend in new business continues – for financing of both new and used vehicles.\n\nA total of about 850,000 new leasing and credit financing contracts were concluded in the first half-year. This represents a significant increase of 16.5 percent year-over-year.\n\nThe volume of new business, encompassing all new credit financing and leasing contracts, climbed 18.2 percent to around 32 billion euros.\n\nThis positive development in new business is also reflected in the portfolio. The total value of all contracts managed surpassed 143 billion euros for the first time.\n\nSegment earnings amounted to just under 1.5 billion euros. This year-on-year decrease of 13.1 percent resulted mainly from lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, which reflects the continued normalisation of the used car market.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the credit loss ratio for the entire credit portfolio was 0.25 percent (2023: 0.15 percent).\n\nThe segment’s overall business performance was better than anticipated. For this reason, we are raising our full-year guidance for Return on Equity (RoE) from a range between 14 and 17 percent to a range between 15 and 18 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Motorcycles Segment in Q2\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, second-quarter deliveries increased by 2.6 percent compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nEBIT in the second quarter totalled 110 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 11.1 percent.\n\nSLIDE 11: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nthe BMW Group is on course to meet its targets for the year.\n\nThe market development in China in the first half of this year has not met our expectations.\n\nWe expect that the various measures taken by the government, including the cut in lending rates in July, will lead to a stabilisation of the market starting in the third quarter.\n\nOur overall business environment will remain challenging throughout the rest of the year.\n\nOur guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate.\n\nGroup earnings before tax will decrease slightly.\n\nWe expect to see a slight increase in demand, with sales in the Automotive Segment slightly higher than the previous year. The percentage of all-electric vehicles will increase significantly.\n\nWe are targeting an EBIT margin between 8 and 10 percent and a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 15 and 20 percent.\n\nDeliveries are projected to increase slightly in the Motorcycles Segment. The EBIT margin should come in between 8 and 10 percent, with a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 21 and 26 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment we are now forecasting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 15 to 18 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 12: BMW Group with Consistent Strategy and Focused Execution\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group is pursuing a clear strategic approach, focused on long-term success.\n\nOur company maintains a globally balanced footprint. We are leveraging this balance and the high flexibility of all our systems to mitigate market volatility and consistently provide our customers with the best products to suit their needs.\n\nWe continue to systematically implement our electrification and digitalisation strategy and make targeted investments in our future model line-up.\n\nIn 2024, we are setting a decisive course for our future. Research and development spending and capital expenditure will therefore respectively peak, as planned.\n\nWe expect our R&D ratio for the full year to exceed five percent, with a capex ratio of more than six percent.\n\nDespite these high upfront investments, we were still able to deliver a solid financial performance in the second quarter, thanks to our attractive product range.\n\nAcross global markets, we are carefully steering our performance in line with individual market conditions.\n\nAt the same time, we are maintaining a high level of cost discipline.\n\nWhether manufacturing costs, fixed costs, or capital expenditure: at the BMW Group, we have always constantly optimized our cost structures and will continue to do so.\n\nI am confident that our clear long-term strategy, combined with focused execution in our operational business, will keep us competitive and successful – both now and in the future.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Countryman: energy consumption combined in l/100km: 6,2; CO2 emissions combined g/km: 141; CO2 class E MINI Cooper 3-Türer: energy consumption combined in l/100km: 6,4; CO2 emissions combined g/km: 144; CO2 class E MINI Aceman E: electricity consumption combined: 14,7 – 14,1 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 298 - 310"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statement Walter Mertl, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Conference Call Half-Year Report to 30 June 2024"}]}

This represents a significant increase of 16.5 percent year-over-year.\n\nThe volume of new business, encompassing all new credit financing and leasing contracts, climbed 18.2 percent to around 32 billion euros.\n\nThis positive development in new business is also reflected in the portfolio. The total value of all contracts managed surpassed 143 billion euros for the first time.\n\nSegment earnings amounted to just under 1.5 billion euros. This year-on-year decrease of 13.1 percent resulted mainly from lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, which reflects the continued normalisation of the used car market.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the credit loss ratio for the entire credit portfolio was 0.25 percent (2023: 0.15 percent).\n\nThe segment’s overall business performance was better than anticipated. For this reason, we are raising our full-year guidance for Return on Equity (RoE) from a range between 14 and 17 percent to a range between 15 and 18 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Motorcycles Segment in Q2\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, second-quarter deliveries increased by 2.6 percent compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nEBIT in the second quarter totalled 110 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 11.1 percent.\n\nSLIDE 11: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nthe BMW Group is on course to meet its targets for the year.\n\nThe market development in China in the first half of this year has not met our expectations.\n\nWe expect that the various measures taken by the government, including the cut in lending rates in July, will lead to a stabilisation of the market starting in the third quarter.\n\nOur overall business environment will remain challenging throughout the rest of the year.\n\nOur guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate.\n\nGroup earnings before tax will decrease slightly.\n\nWe expect to see a slight increase in demand, with sales in the Automotive Segment slightly higher than the previous year. The percentage of all-electric vehicles will increase significantly.\n\nWe are targeting an EBIT margin between 8 and 10 percent and a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 15 and 20 percent.\n\nDeliveries are projected to increase slightly in the Motorcycles Segment. The EBIT margin should come in between 8 and 10 percent, with a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 21 and 26 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment we are now forecasting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 15 to 18 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 12: BMW Group with Consistent Strategy and Focused Execution\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group is pursuing a clear strategic approach, focused on long-term success.\n\nOur company maintains a globally balanced footprint.

This represents 17.4 percent of our total sales.\n\nOur electrified vehicles – in other words, BEVs, plus plug-in hybrids – accounted for almost 24 percent of total sales in the second quarter.\n\nSegment revenues increased slightly by 1.4 percent.\n\nAdjusted for currency translation effects, revenues saw an increase of 2.1 percent.\n\nThe significant growth in all-electric vehicles and models from the upper premium segment contributed to this. The current trend is also expected to have a positive effect on revenues for the remainder of 2024.\n\nRevenue per wholesale unit across the entire product portfolio is expected to be in line with last year’s level.\n\nEBIT for the period from April to June totalled 2.7 billion euros.\n\nThe EBIT margin came in at 8.4 percent for the quarter and 8.6 percent for the half-year.\n\nExcluding the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA, the EBIT margin was 9.4 percent for the second quarter and 9.6 percent through six months.\n\nThat brings me to the EBIT bridge, to explain in more detail the changes in the operating result, compared to the second quarter of the previous year.\n\nSLIDE 6: Automotive Segment EBIT in Q2\n\nThe net balance of currency and commodity positions provided a tailwind of 500 million euros over last year’s second quarter.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we anticipate a positive net balance from currency and commodity positions.\n\nThis is expected to nearly offset material cost headwinds. However, we see additional requests for supply chain support.\n\nThe net balance of volume, model mix and pricing effects in the second quarter was about 300 million euros lower year-on-year.\n\nVolume development and the model mix made a positive contribution to this.\n\nThe global price environment for new and used cars continued to normalise in the second quarter.\n\nThe Chinese market, in particular, remains highly competitive.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect the net effect from volumes, model mix and prices to be neutral over last year.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by about 100 million euros compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe BMW Group's research and development expenditure remained at a high level through the end of June, totalling almost 4.2 billion euros.\n\nThe R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code was at 5.7 percent after the first six months.\n\nThe capitalization ratio for development costs, which is relevant for R&D costs according to IFRS, was 34 percent in the second quarter and 30.8 percent as of June.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses increased by around 100 million euros compared to the previous year, primarily driven by personnel costs and expenses for IT projects.\n\nThe headwind of 200 million euros from Other Cost Changes can mainly be attributed to manufacturing costs. Here, inflation in material costs continues to have an impact.\n\nSLIDE 7: Automotive Segment Free Cash Flow in Q2\n\nFree cash flow in the Automotive Segment totalled 1 billion euros in the second quarter.\n\nThe change in working capital, amounting to 500 million euros, is largely due to the planned increase in inventory levels. This ensures we can continue to meet global demand for our products in the second half of the year.\n\nThe net effect from capital expenditure and depreciation reduced free cash flow by 400 million euros in the second quarter.\n\nTotal investments for April to June amounted to around 2.6 billion euros.\n\nThe capex ratio came in at 5.8 percent for the second quarter and 4.7 percent for the half-year.\n\nAs in the previous years, the major share of capital expenditure will occur in the second half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter.\n\nWe expect a capex ratio of more than six percent for the full year.\n\nChanges to provisions positively impacted free cash flow in the second quarter by around 100 million euros.\n\nThe change in the position Other of around 800 million euros mainly reflects regular tax payments.\n\nAfter the first six months, Automotive Segment free cash flow had reached just over 2.3 billion euros.\n\nThe difference in free cashflow compared to 2023 is due to the capex increase of around 1 billion euros.\n\nWe expect to see a positive contribution from a reduction in working capital.\n\nFor the full year, we are targeting a free cash flow of over six billion euros.\n\nSince 2022, we have made a paradigm shift in our shareholder return strategy by adding a share buyback programme that supplements our annual dividend payout.\n\nIn doing so, we have increased the payout ratio of Automotive Free Cashflow by paying dividends in our target corridor of 30 to 40 percent as well as using the share buyback program.\n\nBMW AG is continuing with its share repurchase programme as planned. At the end of June, it had acquired shares equivalent to 5.51 percent of the existing share capital as of June 30th.\n\nThe second tranche of the second programme, totalling 500 million euros, was completed in June.\n\nThe third tranche of 500 million euros, which began in June, will be concluded no later than December 31st.\n\nBy the end of 2024, BMW AG will have repurchased shares valued at 1.5 billion euros as part of the second programme, which amounts to 2 billion euros.\n\nSLIDE 8: Net Financial Assets\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group has a solid and robust balance sheet, confirming the company's considerable financial strength.\n\nThis is also underscored by our net financial assets in the automotive business, which totalled just over 43 billion euros.\n\nStarting with the Half-Year Report 2024, we are changing the way we report net financial assets in our automotive business.\n\nIn addition to the Automotive Segment’s NFA that was previously reported, the new figure also includes the NFA of holding companies within the Other Entities Segment, which receive regular distributions from their subsidiaries.\n\nI trust that this new, comprehensive definition of Net Financial Assets provides you with useful additional information.\n\nSLIDE 9: Financial Services Segment in H1\n\nLet’s move on to the Financial Services Segment.\n\nHere, the positive trend in new business continues – for financing of both new and used vehicles.\n\nA total of about 850,000 new leasing and credit financing contracts were concluded in the first half-year. This represents a significant increase of 16.5 percent year-over-year.\n\nThe volume of new business, encompassing all new credit financing and leasing contracts, climbed 18.2 percent to around 32 billion euros.\n\nThis positive development in new business is also reflected in the portfolio. The total value of all contracts managed surpassed 143 billion euros for the first time.\n\nSegment earnings amounted to just under 1.5 billion euros. This year-on-year decrease of 13.1 percent resulted mainly from lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, which reflects the continued normalisation of the used car market.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the credit loss ratio for the entire credit portfolio was 0.25 percent (2023: 0.15 percent).\n\nThe segment’s overall business performance was better than anticipated. For this reason, we are raising our full-year guidance for Return on Equity (RoE) from a range between 14 and 17 percent to a range between 15 and 18 percent.\n\nSLIDE 10: Motorcycles Segment in Q2\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, second-quarter deliveries increased by 2.6 percent compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nEBIT in the second quarter totalled 110 million euros, with an EBIT margin of 11.1 percent.\n\nSLIDE 11: Outlook 2024\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nthe BMW Group is on course to meet its targets for the year.\n\nThe market development in China in the first half of this year has not met our expectations.\n\nWe expect that the various measures taken by the government, including the cut in lending rates in July, will lead to a stabilisation of the market starting in the third quarter.\n\nOur overall business environment will remain challenging throughout the rest of the year.\n\nOur guidance assumes that geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions will not deteriorate.\n\nGroup earnings before tax will decrease slightly.\n\nWe expect to see a slight increase in demand, with sales in the Automotive Segment slightly higher than the previous year. The percentage of all-electric vehicles will increase significantly.\n\nWe are targeting an EBIT margin between 8 and 10 percent and a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 15 and 20 percent.\n\nDeliveries are projected to increase slightly in the Motorcycles Segment. The EBIT margin should come in between 8 and 10 percent, with a Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) between 21 and 26 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment we are now forecasting a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 15 to 18 percent for the full year.\n\nSLIDE 12: BMW Group with Consistent Strategy and Focused Execution\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe BMW Group is pursuing a clear strategic approach, focused on long-term success.\n\nOur company maintains a globally balanced footprint.

As part of the new constellation, media and marketing approaches are being adapted to the requirements of digitalisation and sustainability. The focus here is on artificial intelligence (AI), centralised data management, hybrid teams and integrated platforms (media hubs). The aim is to make campaigns more efficient, more targeted and more responsible.\n\n“I am personally very excited to have Dentsu as our new media agency partner. Together we are entering a new chapter for a communication truly focused on the European customer,” says Uwe Dreher, Vice President Marketing BMW Europe, and adds: “Our goal to act in a highly data-driven and targeted multi-channel and multiple market planning approach elevated via state-of-the-art AI tools to increase efficiency and impact has been reached – the execution will accelerate marketing Return on Investment for our markets even further. BMW Marketing Europe is excited to be launching our Neue Klasse in this new constellation.”\n\nTailor-made communications for the Neue Klasse era.The aim of the call for tenders was to ensure seamless, brand-compliant BMW Group communications across all media channels – at both the national and international level. Awarding the European media business to Dentsu is an important step towards implementing the European media strategy. The consolidation of media activities forms the basis of a standardised solution across all of Europe. The launch of the new agency constellation coincides with the market launch of the Neue Klasse and marks a new era, characterised by highly innovative vehicle technologies on the one hand and a fundamentally new understanding of the brand and communications on the other. The new media approach reflects this transformation.\n\nAI-controlled, with a centralised European media hub.\n\nThe comprehensive use of artificial intelligence will be a key factor. Advanced AI tools will bring even greater precision to media planning. Target groups will be recognised and reached more accurately and decisions made on the basis of concrete data – measurable performance indicators. This will verifiably increase the real-time effectiveness and efficiency of advertising across all customer touchpoints.\n\nAnother key element of the new set-up is the creation of an integrated media hub. Online and offline media will be seamlessly combined on this platform. This enables cross-channel synergies to be recognised and exploited. It helps ensure transparency and makes for efficient planning and implementation. Centralisation enables consolidated control of all activities and channels as well as centralised data analysis. Even so, there will always be room for localisation: national market conditions and cultural specifics – and differentiated responses to them – are additional factors for success.\n\nIntegration of all BMW Group brands.\n\nThe new media strategy follows a multi-brand approach: BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad will be looked at in combination. This creates new opportunities for optimisation across the various media, supported by hybrid teams combining on‑shore, near-shore and off-shore expertise. This know-how from many international markets creates additional flexibility and quality in implementation and is a response to the rapidly changing requirements in the international media business.\n\nCustomer focus: media optimisation along the entire customer journey.The new model consistently focuses on the customer journey – from the first impulse, the first encounter, all the way to vehicle purchase. Target groups are addressed more precisely, delivering even greater emotional and situation-specific impact. The transition to a more performance-focused planning approach, where factors such as real-time data and sales targets play a key role, significantly increases the measurable impact of media communications. At the same time, the planning approach supports direct sales and aids the transformation towards a sustainable retail model.\n\nSustainability and responsibility in media communications.Another key consideration in the BMW Group’s choice of agency partner was sustainability. This aspect was systematically integrated into the evaluation of potential agency partners. Examples include production processes marked by a reduced carbon footprint and ethically transparent media bookings.

The goal is to translate the strong pace shown by the car at Le Mans into good results and to collect important points for the overall standings. In the LMGT3 category, Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR) are aiming for the World Championship title after their victory at Imola (ITA) and a second place at Le Mans most recently.

Now he returns with his fellow drivers in the #31 BMW M4 GT3 to fight for the World Championship lead in the LMGT3 class. The trio is just two points behind the leaders with 73 points.

In the LMGT3 class, after the Le Mans podium with the #31 BMW M4 GT3, the goal is clear. If you are so close to the World Championship lead at the halfway point of the season, you naturally want to win the title.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “The entire WRT team is very much looking forward to competing in South America for the first time – and at such an iconic place as Interlagos.

From a sporting perspective, we hope to maintain our strong momentum from our very strong race at Le Mans and to be able to achieve a similar – or even better – result.

Following the mega-event of the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) heads into the second half of the season this coming weekend with the 6 Hours of São Paulo (BRA). In the Hypercar class, BMW M Team WRT will compete with two BMW M Hybrid V8 cars. The goal is to translate the strong pace shown by the car at Le Mans into good results and to collect important points for the overall standings. In the LMGT3 category, Augusto Farfus (BRA), Sean Gelael (INA), and Darren Leung (GBR) are aiming for the World Championship title after their victory at Imola (ITA) and a second place at Le Mans most recently. For Farfus, who was born in Curitiba (BRA), a very special home race awaits.\n\nIt has been 14 years since Farfus last competed in races for BMW in his home country of Brazil – in 2010 in the FIA World Touring Car Championship (FIA WTCC). Now he returns with his fellow drivers in the #31 BMW M4 GT3 to fight for the World Championship lead in the LMGT3 class. The trio is just two points behind the leaders with 73 points. In the #46 BMW M4 GT3, Maxime Martin (BEL), Valentino Rossi (ITA), and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) will take turns.\n\nIn the Hypercar class, Raffaele Marciello (SUI), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) in the #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, as well as Robin Frijns (NED), René Rast (GER), and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) in the #20 BMW M Hybrid V8, aim to achieve good positions after disappointing results at Le Mans. With the fastest qualifying time at Le Mans, the car has proved it can keep up with the best, and now the team aims to regain the consistency in the race that was lacking last time.\n\nThe 6 Hours of São Paulo will start on Sunday, 14th July, at 16:30 CEST (11:30 local time).\n\nOn Friday, at 18:15 local time in the paddock, there will be a ‘Meet the Team’ event with all drivers, Head of BMW M Motorsport Andreas Roos, and WRT Team Principal Vincent Vosse. All accredited media representatives are invited.\n\nComments before the 6 Hours of São Paulo:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Even though we couldn't achieve the hoped-for good results in the Hypercar class at the highlight at Le Mans, we start optimistically into the second half of the FIA WEC season in São Paulo. The outcome of the Le Mans racewas disappointing, but the pace of the BMW M Hybrid V8 was encouraging. We have seen that if we get everything right as a team, we can keep up with the best already in our debut season. That is exactly our task for the remaining races. to get everything right. In the LMGT3 class, after the Le Mans podium with the #31 BMW M4 GT3, the goal is clear. If you are so close to the World Championship lead at the halfway point of the season, you naturally want to win the title.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal BMW M Team WRT): “The entire WRT team is very much looking forward to competing in South America for the first time – and at such an iconic place as Interlagos. With the BMW M Hybrid V8, it's about using the second half of the season for further progress and turning the significant performance improvements achieved since Qatar into results. From now on, our focus is also on the 2025 season. In the LMGT3 class, the mission for number 31 is clear: to win the World Championship title. For the #46 BMW M4 GT3, the goal is to achieve the first victory in the FIA WEC. The crew has not had the necessary racing luck so far this season. Hopefully, we can change that.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8): “I am very much looking forward to racing at Interlagos for the first time. I have been there twice before, but as a reserve driver. The layout of the track is great, and I expect an interesting race.

After winning race one on Saturday and the Superpole Race on Sunday morning – which also marked BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s 100th podium in WorldSBK – he went on to win the second main race as well, taking over the lead in the riders’ standings. After seven of twelve rounds, Razgatlioglu now holds a four-point lead over Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati). His total of twelve wins at Donington Park also sets a new record. His teammate, Michael van der Mark (NED), suffered a series of setbacks in the UK through no fault of his own. He finished 13th on Saturday and retired from both races on Sunday. The season continues from 25th to 27th July at the brand-new Balaton Park Circuit in Hungary.\n\nReactions after the Donington Park round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an incredible weekend for us, putting us back in the lead of the world championship – right where we belong. I think a lot of people wrote us off after the season opener in Australia. I’m incredibly proud of the team, the engineers at home, the test team, all the mechanics, and everyone else who puts in tireless effort. No one gave up – everyone worked to bring us back to the front, to fight for victories again, and now to lead the championship. Toprak did an unbelievable job. He’s back in his flow, and you can feel his mental strength. Nothing can shake him. Everyone works with full focus from the first free practice to the final race. We are immensely proud of that. Unfortunately, Mickey had an extremely tough weekend here, and together we will do everything to bring him back to the front as well. Lastly, on behalf of all at BMW Motorrad, I’d like to thank the team: to take the triple win at the home round is just fantastic.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This weekend at Donington brought unusually warm conditions, which presented a challenge for the entire paddock so Friday was initially a process of adaptation for us. We worked very intensively during the practice sessions to understand the bike under these conditions and grip levels. That worked out perfectly – the BMW M 1000 RR was spot on. From FP3 onward, the bike was in an ideal operating window, and for the rest of the weekend we only needed to fine-tune it. Toprak’s outstanding Superpole lap and race performances confirmed this. Unfortunately, Mickey’s weekend was severely impacted by his unavoidable crash in FP3 – he went down on oil left on the track following another rider’s engine failure. This triggered a chain of unfortunate events, requiring a lot of repair and analysis work. One thing led to another. We apologise to him and are confident he’ll bounce back in Hungary. It’s a new circuit for everyone, which makes it exciting. One of the strengths of both our riders is their ability to quickly adapt to new tracks, so we’re really looking forward to racing at Balaton Park Circuit.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I'm very happy because before I came here, my biggest target was the hat-trick. I love this track and I really like riding here. I’m enjoying it and now I have 12 wins here, so I broke the record. It’s of course also good to now be in the championship lead, but I’m not focused on that, I just focus from race to race and on winning them. The next races are at Balaton which is new for everyone. We will see there. I hope we will win there, too. The circuit is a bit difficult but also suits my style a bit. But we will see. We will work hard and then we are ready to fight for the win again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This has been a very tough one. It seemed that the odds were against us this weekend. There was this crash on oil I couldn’t avoid in FP3, then we were struggling with different technical issues. Everyone worked really hard but the only reward we got was the points from race one. Now we will regroup and then head to Hungary; a new track for everyone and I am sure we can turn our fortunes there again. Toprak has shown the potential of the bike and I am happy for him and the team for the hat-trick.

The season continues from 25th to 27th July at the brand-new Balaton Park Circuit in Hungary.\n\nReactions after the Donington Park round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was an incredible weekend for us, putting us back in the lead of the world championship – right where we belong. I think a lot of people wrote us off after the season opener in Australia. I’m incredibly proud of the team, the engineers at home, the test team, all the mechanics, and everyone else who puts in tireless effort. No one gave up – everyone worked to bring us back to the front, to fight for victories again, and now to lead the championship. Toprak did an unbelievable job. He’s back in his flow, and you can feel his mental strength. Nothing can shake him. Everyone works with full focus from the first free practice to the final race. We are immensely proud of that. Unfortunately, Mickey had an extremely tough weekend here, and together we will do everything to bring him back to the front as well. Lastly, on behalf of all at BMW Motorrad, I’d like to thank the team: to take the triple win at the home round is just fantastic.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “This weekend at Donington brought unusually warm conditions, which presented a challenge for the entire paddock so Friday was initially a process of adaptation for us. We worked very intensively during the practice sessions to understand the bike under these conditions and grip levels. That worked out perfectly – the BMW M 1000 RR was spot on. From FP3 onward, the bike was in an ideal operating window, and for the rest of the weekend we only needed to fine-tune it. Toprak’s outstanding Superpole lap and race performances confirmed this. Unfortunately, Mickey’s weekend was severely impacted by his unavoidable crash in FP3 – he went down on oil left on the track following another rider’s engine failure. This triggered a chain of unfortunate events, requiring a lot of repair and analysis work. One thing led to another. We apologise to him and are confident he’ll bounce back in Hungary. It’s a new circuit for everyone, which makes it exciting. One of the strengths of both our riders is their ability to quickly adapt to new tracks, so we’re really looking forward to racing at Balaton Park Circuit.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I'm very happy because before I came here, my biggest target was the hat-trick. I love this track and I really like riding here. I’m enjoying it and now I have 12 wins here, so I broke the record. It’s of course also good to now be in the championship lead, but I’m not focused on that, I just focus from race to race and on winning them. The next races are at Balaton which is new for everyone. We will see there. I hope we will win there, too. The circuit is a bit difficult but also suits my style a bit. But we will see. We will work hard and then we are ready to fight for the win again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This has been a very tough one. It seemed that the odds were against us this weekend. There was this crash on oil I couldn’t avoid in FP3, then we were struggling with different technical issues. Everyone worked really hard but the only reward we got was the points from race one. Now we will regroup and then head to Hungary; a new track for everyone and I am sure we can turn our fortunes there again. Toprak has shown the potential of the bike and I am happy for him and the team for the hat-trick. We all will work very hard now and my aim is to be back in the mix before we go into the summer break.”\n\nAir temperature: 21°, track temperature: 33°, humidity: 61%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAir temperature: 27°, track temperature: 41°, humidity: 44%, conditions: dry, laps: 23.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 6, 1:26.441\n\nAir temperature: 21°, track temperature: 30°, humidity: 67%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nElf Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 2, 1:25.666\n\nAir temperature: 24°, track temperature: 38°, humidity: 54%, conditions: dry, laps: 23.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nÁlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 4, 1:25.961\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R07/12, after 21 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R07/12, after 21 of 36 races)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Press Release"}]}

MINI remains true to its claim: “Less is more”, focusing on what really matters. With this approach, MINI makes an important contribution to shaping the future in a more conscious and sustainable way. This commitment is particularly reflected in the current MINI generation, for example through the use of innovative and recycled materials in the interior.\n\nKnit partially made from Recyclate – Sustainability You Can Feel\n\nIn line with the \"Secondary First\" principle, MINI uses knit from recycled materials in all models starting with the market launch in 2024. The knitted material consists of 92% polyester recyclate and is used for dashboard upholstery, door trim, and center console lid. This significantly reduces CO2e emissions and water consumption in production compared to primary materials.\n\nDesign, Function, and Sustainability\n\nThe specially developed knitted look gives the interior of the MINI family a distinctive look and opens up new possibilities for individual colour and pattern worlds. It enables a two-colour design with an impressive depth effect. This effect occurs when the colour of the lower textile layer subtly shines through the upper layer. This structure, inspired by sneaker design and carefully further developed, gives the surfaces visual complexity and ensures a high-quality, unique look in the interior. The components are also abrasion-resistant, structurally reinforced, and completely leather-free.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 also relies on this innovative technology: In the \"Contemporary\" trim of the first model of the Neue Klasse, the knit of the instrument panel is made of 75% recycled material – a clear commitment to the principle of \"Design for Circularity\". While the light in the MINI family is projected onto the dashboard, the lighting in the BMW iX3 comes from the rear. For this, the knit pattern was deliberately designed to be more translucent so that the new backlighting comes into its own optimally.\n\nStronger Together: Collaboration is Key\n\nThe textile solution for the MINI interior was made ready for series production in close collaboration with internal and external partners: cross-industry and cross-departmental cooperation proves to be the key to innovations in sustainability. Close cooperation with partners generates new impulses and solutions that further advance sustainable materials and processes and enable the development of future-oriented products.\n\nThis innovative strength was recently honoured: MINI Knit is the overall winner of the SPE Automotive Award 2025 and winner of the Grand Award in the \"Body Interior\" category. The award is one of the most prestigious honors in the plastics industry. The Grand Award is presented for the best submission across all categories.\n\nDr. Cornelia Bovensiepen, Spokesperson Product Sustainability\n\nMedia website: \n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide.

This fresh approach to delivering the performance profile for which M cars are renowned teams up with bespoke chassis technology and the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system to deliver a performance experience of rare magnetism and allure.\n\nThe Hill beckons: BMW lines up with new machinery, racing legends and famous drivers and riders.\n\nBMW Group Classic’s historic motor sport department will also bring a host of legendary vehicles and well-known drivers and riders to the event. Leading the way will be the BMW V12 LMR, which celebrated overall victory in the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1999. Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, will get behind the wheel on the 25th anniversary of this famous win. 55 years have now passed since Dieter Quester was crowned European touring car champion in a BMW 2002 TIK. This was the first championship title claimed by a BMW with a turbocharged engine. Piloting the 2002 TIK in the hill climb at this year’s Festival of Speed will be BMW Group Classic brand ambassador Prince Leopold of Bavaria. And memories of great victories will also be rekindled for legendary BMW touring car driver Johnny Cecotto: 30 years on from winning the Super Touring Car Cup, he will be reunited with his BMW 318i STW at Goodwood.\n\nBMW Group Classic will compete in the hill climb events for motorcycles with a pair of historic racing bikes. The BMW RS 54 from the 1950s will be joined by a meticulously restored replica of the BMW R 255/1 with supercharged engine. In 1939, Georg “Schorsch” Meier rode a R 255/1 to victory in the Senior Tourist Trophy on the Isle of Man, becoming the first foreign rider to do so on a non-English bike. Among the riders lining up on these historic models will be Markus Flasch, Head of BMW Motorrad, who will also be piloting the BMW R20 concept through the twists and turns of the course. The latest concept bike from BMW Motorrad was unveiled to the public for the first time just a few weeks ago at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Its design places the new 2.0-litre Big Boxer engine at centre stage, and the hill climb will now also provide it with the platform to showcase its power development and acoustic charms.\n\nNew models, one-off creations, concept cars and Vision Vehicles among the attractions at trackside.\n\nIn honour of designer Marcello Gandini, who passed away in spring this year, BMW Group Classic will also be presenting the BMW Garmisch. This coupé is a rebuild of a concept car that Gandini had designed for coachbuilder Bertone but that then vanished without trace following its premiere at the 1970 Geneva Motor Show.\n\nThe vehicles on display at the Stable Yard will also include the BMW Vision Neue Klasse – which offers a look ahead to the upcoming generation of fully electric models from BMW – and the BMW i5 Flow NOSTOKANA, a one-off design whose exterior displays motifs from South African artist Esther Mahlangu using innovative colour-change technology. Also produced in just a single example so far, the BMW Concept Skytop has an exclusive blend of aesthetic appeal and dynamic potency. This design study is making only its second ever public appearance, following on from its world premiere at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. An open-top two-seater, the BMW Concept Skytop symbolises the joy of luxury travel.
