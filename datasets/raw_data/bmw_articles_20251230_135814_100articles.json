      "content": "Munich. After twelve successful years, the collaboration between BMW M Motorsport and Jesse Krohn (FIN) is coming to an end. Both parties have agreed not to extend the works driver contract, which expires after the 2025 season. Krohn will face new challenges in the future. His career began in 2014 in the BMW M Motorsport Junior Programme and led him to major victories in the 24-hour classics at Daytona (USA) and the Nürburgring (GER).\n\n\"BMW M Motorsport Junior of the Year\": Jesse Krohn, then aged 24, first attracted attention with this title at the end of the 2014 season. He had prevailed against three competitors in the first year of the then talent promotion programme and started his career as a member of the BMW M Motorsport family from that point on. His first stops were the ADAC GT Masters and the Nürburgring 24 Hours. In 2017/2018, he celebrated his first title win in the GT class of the Asian Le Mans Series.\n\nIn 2016, Krohn drove in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship for the first time, where he celebrated many of his greatest successes in the following years. In 2019, he enjoyed the special experience of competing in the Daytona 24 Hours together with Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) at the wheel of the BMW M8 GTE. A year later, he triumphed in the GTLM class at the US endurance classic and also became IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup champion together with John Edwards (USA) at the end of the season. In 2024, Krohn joined the BMW M Motorsport Hypercar programme and contested the entire IMSA season in the BMW M Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team RLL. He won the \"Battle on the Bricks\" in Indianapolis (USA) together with Philipp Eng (AUT).\n\nThe 2025 season brought Krohn another milestone in his career – his first overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. He also won the 3-hour race of the GT World Challenge Europe on the Grand Prix circuit in the Eifel. After twelve years, Krohn is one of the longest-serving members of the BMW M Motorsport family.\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"I would like to thank Jesse Krohn very much for the past twelve years at BMW M Motorsport. During the time we worked together, I got to know him as a very reliable racing driver who always gave his all for his job. This professional attitude has led him to great successes – be it with the BMW M8 GTE at Daytona, with the BMW M Hybrid V8 at Indianapolis or most recently with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO at the Nürburgring. It is impressive to see how incredibly far he has come from being a junior driver. Jesse Krohn's career at BMW M Motorsport is a prime example of successful promotion of young talent. He and everyone involved can be very proud of this. Jesse will now be taking on new challenges. I wish him all the best for this!\"\n\nJesse Krohn: \"It has been a long, successful time at BMW M Motorsport and I am very grateful for all the opportunities it has given me. BMW M Motorsport has given me the chance to become a professional racing driver and I have had the privilege of being part of most of BMW M Motorsport's top racing programmes after winning the Junior Programme in 2014. I have competed in over 200 races around the world with great teams and team-mates and have had many successes along the way. All good things come to an end, but new and exciting challenges await me. I would like to thank all the teams, team-mates and all the BMW M Motorsport staff I have had the pleasure of working with over the past twelve years. I wish everyone all the best for the future and every success for 2026. I will miss you, but we will meet again on the race track in the future.\""

      "content": "Munich. A clear strategy, fascinating products and competent leadership are decisive factors for the attractiveness of employers today. Especially in times of global and economic uncertainty, the BMW Group proves to be a reliable partner for its employees. Numerous recent studies confirm this and have once again recognised the BMW Group as one of the most attractive employers in 2025.\n\n14 years at the top: BMW Group once again the most popular employer\n\nIn the Trendence Professionals Barometer 2025, the BMW Group achieved first place for the 14th time in a row. This study is one of the leading surveys on employer attractiveness and is based on a survey of around 18,000 academics in Germany. The BMW Group also once again achieved top positions in other renowned rankings such as Universum's \"Most Attractive Employers in Europe\" and the international Forbes ranking \"World's Best Employers\".\n\nResponsibility, strategy and courage\n\n\"You don't become the best employer by yourself. For us, it's about more than awards: We are facing one of the biggest changes in our industry - electromobility, digitalisation and artificial intelligence. Anyone who chooses the BMW Group relies on responsible behaviour, a clear strategy and the courage to try something new. This is exactly what makes us strong.

In the current ranking of the \"Most Attractive Employers in Europe 2025\" by study provider Universum, in which over 64,000 students from six major European economic nations took part, the BMW Group ranks seventh worldwide among prospective engineers. Among students in the fields of IT and business, the company ranks among the top 18 employers worldwide. In addition, the BMW Group was honoured with fifth place in the global Forbes survey \"World's Best Employers 2025\", which is based on the responses of 300,000 professionals from 50 countries. This makes the BMW Group not only the best automotive player in this international ranking, but also the best-placed German and European company.\n\nOutstanding results in other national studies\n\nThe BMW Group also achieved outstanding results in other national studies:\n\nInternal satisfaction confirms external perception\n\nThe external perception is in line with the results of the internal employee survey: 92 per cent of BMW Group employees are proud to be part of the company and 87 per cent would recommend the BMW Group as an employer.\n\nThese top figures once again confirm the results of the employee surveys of previous years and also emphasise the attractiveness of the BMW Group as an employer.\n\nYoung talents and experienced professionals in future competences such as artificial intelligence, software development and data science will find exciting challenges at the BMW Group and can apply at any time. Interested talents can find out what working at the BMW Group is like and what entry opportunities and vacancies are available on the BMW Group careers pages as well as on the BMW Group Careers social media channels:\n\nArtificial Intelligence at the BMW Group\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n\nBMW Group Corporate Communications\n\nDr Hans-Peter Ketterl\n\nSpokesman Human Resources and Member of the Board of Management Human Resources and Real Estate\n\nHead of Communications for HR, Real Estate, Culture, Corporate Citizenship\n\nPhone: +49-89-382-59490\n\nWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services.

      "content": "Munich. BMW Motorrad Motorsport continued its success story in both factory and customer racing in 2025, collecting titles, wins and podium finishes around the globe. In the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), factory rider Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) impressively defended his riders’ title and once again was crowned World Champion aboard the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. In addition, private teams and riders secured no fewer than 12 further titles in the most important international and national championships worldwide. The BMW M 1000 RR also proved to be a class of its own once again in international road racing this year.\n\nA look at WorldSBK, the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) and numerous other championships across Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australia shows that BMW racers were even more successful in 2025 than in the previous year. Overall, they stood on the podium 411 times, achieving 169 wins and 242 additional podium finishes. This means that the factory riders and BMW customer racers once again surpassed the already outstanding figures from the previous year (371 / 142 / 229).\n\n“Behind us lies a season that surpassed our successes from 2024 once again – in factory racing as well as in customer racing,” says Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport. “Toprak’s successful title defense in WorldSBK will remain unforgettable, with no fewer than 21 wins in 36 races. In the FIM Endurance World Championship, we were also on course for the title in a dramatic finale until just minutes before the finish, before a technical issue prevented this potentially historic success for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. But next year we will have another chance to become world champions in endurance racing as well. In customer racing, private riders and teams in a wide range of series around the world consistently achieved top results and numerous titles. BMW riders also celebrated further sensational victories in road racing. All these successes fill us with great pride – they prove that the BMW M 1000 RR is a true winning motorcycle and that our global BMW Motorrad Motorsport family is stronger than ever.”\n\n“The BMW M 1000 RR is one of the best bikes in international racing – and this season once again showed that our customers can rely on it in championships around the globe,” says Uwe Geyer, Head of BMW Motorrad Customer Racing. “We are proud to be able to provide private teams and riders with such a strong package. The race version of the BMW M 1000 RR forms an excellent foundation, and with our global support network we help our customers convert this potential into titles and victories in their championships. Our racing components originate from our factory racing efforts, and all our customers worldwide benefit from the close cooperation between our factory teams, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team and our development department.”\n\nThe 2025 BMW Champions at a glance.\n\nIsle of Man, Macau and more: BMW racers dominate the world’s most important road races.\n\nOnce again in the 2025 season, there was no way past the BMW riders in international road racing. The action began with the North West 200, where the BMW M 1000 RR claimed victories in all five races. Davey Todd (GBR) secured three wins, while Michael Dunlop (GBR) won the other two races. In addition, Todd, Peter Hickman and Ian Hutchinson (both GBR) collected further podium finishes. At the legendary Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, Todd and Dunlop achieved a one-two finish in the Superbike TT, and both riders also stepped onto the podium in the two Superstock races. The Senior TT, in which BMW racers were among the main favorites, was cancelled due to weather conditions. The motorsport world then turns its attention every November to the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix to close out the season. Here, the BMW road racers delivered an outstanding one-two-three result, with Todd taking victory ahead of Hickman and Erno Kostamo (FIN)."

      "content": "Munich. Team WRT and BMW M Motorsport will return to the Mount Panorama Circuit together in 2026. The Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), the season opener of the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC), will be all about defending the title after last year's 1-2 finish. Six BMW M works drivers will line up in the Belgian team's two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs, including last year's winners Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) as well as newcomer Jordan Pepper (RSA).

BMW M works driver Max Hesse (GER) celebrates his Bathurst debut in the cockpit.\n\nIn 2025, the Bathurst 12 Hour was the perfect start to a great IGTC season. BMW M Motorsport celebrated a 1-2 finish in Australia and then won three of the other four IGTC events. The manufacturers' title and the drivers' title for Kelvin van der Linde were the well-deserved reward. The next attempt follows in 2026.

I celebrated many great successes with Charles last season, and I've known Jordan very well since I was a teenager. Defending the title will be a big challenge, but I will do everything I can to finish on top once again in one of the most special races of the year and thus enable Jordan to do what I did a year ago: win Bathurst on my debut with BMW M Motorsport. Winning 2025 with my brother Sheldon and Augusto was one of the proudest moments of my career.\"\n\nJordan Pepper (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): \"I'm really excited and proud to be coming to Bathurst with BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT. What a place for my first works race! My memories of the race are very special. I won there in 2020 and I really enjoy the track, the place and the atmosphere. Of course, we also have pressure, because we are coming there as defending champions, but I have two great teammates in Kelvin and Charles. We get on very well on a professional and personal level. Driving with Kelvin is something very special for me. We've known each other for so long and complement each other very well.\"\n\nAugusto Farfus (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): \"Bathurst is one of the coolest and most challenging races of the year. I'm really looking forward to returning there after my victory last year. Back then, I was still racing against Valentino and Raffaele in the sister car. Now I will do everything I can to stand on the top step of the podium with them again.\"\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT): \"I'm really looking forward to returning to Bathurst. It's one of the best races of the season. The track is fantastic. When I started racing, Bathurst was at the top of my wish list. Now I've been here three times and enjoy it every time. Last year the race went great and we finished second. The podium is the goal again this time. With Raffaele and Augusto, I have two stellar teammates from whom I can learn a lot and with whom I will certainly have a lot of fun.\"\n\nMax Hesse (#89 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team KRC): \"I'm really looking forward to my debut at Bathurst. I've only heard good things about the track and the event so far and can hardly wait to do my first laps there. Before that, I'll certainly be spending a lot of time in the simulator to familiarise myself with the 'mini Nordschleife' as much as possible. Starting the 2026 season with a second highlight race after Daytona is absolutely fantastic. I'm looking forward to the KRC team, where I'll also see some familiar faces, and I think we can play a good role in our class.\"\n\nThe line-ups for 2026 at a glance:\n\n#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nKelvin van der Linde (RSA)\n\n#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT:\n\nRaffaele Marciello (SUI)\n\nValentino Rossi (ITA)\n\n#89 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team KRC:\n\nMaxime Oosten (NED)Ruan Cunfan (CHN)"

It sits in conversation with a constellation of exhibitions, performances, and discursive programmes which are set in close dialogue with Kochi’s unique geographical, social and cultural ecology.\n\nEmbracing process as methodology, this edition places ‘friendship economies’ as the very scaffolding of the exhibition. The curatorial vision acknowledges bodies as a landscape of time, a vessel of labour, joy, and loss, and invites the visitors to think through ‘embodied histories’ of those that came before us and continue to live within us in the form of cells, stories and techniques.\n\nBMW Group India Cultural EngagementSince its inception, BMW India has participated in leading cultural engagements across the country. In 2007, two BMW Art Cars created by world renowned artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were presented at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai. BMW Art Cars by Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Sandro Chia and Cesar Manrique have been exclusively showcased at various editions of the India Art Fair. “The Future is Born of Art” is a unique initiative by BMW India and India Art Fair which aims to propel emerging Indian artists and further BMW Group’s commitment to promote art, sustainability, and innovation. In 2012-13, the innovative BMW Guggenheim Lab came to India. Based at Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum and conducted at six different sites in Mumbai, the lab organised six weeks of free programmes with diverse audiences and communities addressing the challenges and conditions of the urban city.\n\nSince 2012, BMW has partnered with the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the contemporary art exhibition, which brings international artists to India and creates a global platform for Indian artists. This vital and dynamic partnership has been instrumental in shaping the Biennale into a global cultural landmark. BMW Group’s continued commitment, even in uncertain times, highlights its profound belief in the power of art and culture to unite and inspire.\n\nAbout the Kochi-Muziris BiennaleKochi-Muziris Biennale is India’s ﬁrst-ever biennial of international contemporary art and its story is unique to India’s current reality—its political, social and artistic landscape. It began as a government initiative, when the Department of Cultural Aﬀairs of the Government of Kerala approached two artists—Riyas Komu and Bose Krishnamachari—to help organize an international platform for art in India. The challenge was proportionate to the ambition of the project. A biennial had never gotten past the conceptual stage in India before. There was no existing infrastructure necessary for an exhibition of this scale—no spaces and no institutional support structures.\n\nWith the support of the government, private patrons, and local businesses the Biennale found spaces and opened them up for art. The Indian art community has been growing rapidly and is emerging onto the world stage, and the international arts community oﬀered their support in sending art and artists to participate in Kochi. Artists became the spokespersons and activists for the biennale.\n\nAbout Nikhil ChopraNikhil Chopra’s artistic practice interweaves live art, drawing, photography, sculpture and installations. His performances, largely improvised, dwell on identity and its construction, autobiography and authorship, the pose and\n\nself-portraiture. Nikhil combines everyday life, memory and collective history; daily acts such as eating, resting, washing and dressing, in tandem with the act and discipline of making large-scale drawings in situ become the process of making an artwork.\n\nNikhil’s works have been included in major exhibitions including Documenta 14, the12th Sharjah Biennale, the 12th Havana Biennale; the 2nd Kochi-Muziris Biennale and the 53rd Venice Biennale amongst others. He has also shown works and performed at the Gropius Bau, Berlin; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester; New Art Exchange, Nottingham; , SFMOMA, San Francisco; Artsonje, Seoul; Museum of Contemporary Art, Yinchuan, China; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Astrup Fearnley Museum, Oslo, Norway; Indian Highway, Serpentine Gallery, London, UK; Carriageworks, Sydney; and Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi.\n\nNikhil Chopra was born in Kolkata in 1974, and lives in Goa where he runs HH Art Spaces with partners. After studying at the Faculty of Fine Arts at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Vadodara, India, the artist continued his studies in the United States in 2003, returning to India in 2005 with a Master’s degree from Ohio State University.\n\nAbout HH Art SpacesHH Art Spaces, Goa, was founded in 2014 by Nikhil Chopra and Romain Loustau, both live art and performance artists. HH Art Spaces is a movement, and currently includes the shared vision, voices, rigor, and energies of a collective of artists and cultural practitioners. Key founding and partner members of the organization are: Madhavi Gore, Shivani Gupta, and Shaira Sequeira Shetty. HH Art Spaces fosters an ethos of collaborations, residencies and interdisciplinary exchanges within art and culture; and has worked with artists and organizations locally, regionally and internationally.\n\nOver the years, HH Art Spaces has developed a rich archive of visual, sonic, installation, and live art and performance work, in South Asia. HH Art Spaces promotes artists and produces exhibitions and artist residencies, talks and workshops, in contemporary and traditional artistic practice-based research, bridging transdisciplinary practices through collaborations and partnerships. HH is a hub and a laboratory for artists and curators to investigate and explore new forms and approaches within arts and cultural practice.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."

      "content": "Munich. BMW Group Plant Munich is ready for the production of the next vehicle generation. The manufacturing equipment has been installed in the new body shop and assembly line, and functional checks have been successfully completed. During this so-called \"Common Function Test,\" every system undergoes dry runs, in which production planners and plant technicians put the machinery through its paces. All production steps are executed without any parts in the system. Cycle by cycle, an invisible vehicle takes shape. Although no actual car is produced, this process provides the certainty that everything operates seamlessly and as planned.\n\nPeter Weber, head of BMW Group Plant Munich, is delighted: “Just in time for the holidays, we have reached an important milestone: All manufacturing technologies and equipment are ready to go, and we are already training our associates for production of the BMW i3. We are taking major strides towards production of first pre-series vehicles, which will then come completely from our plant.”\n\nHowever, plant employees will have to remain patient a little longer until then. BMW i3 assembly, which has so far been carried out at the nearby Research and Innovation Centre, will be relocating to Plant Munich in January. With this move, all technologies at Plant Munich are then in place to continue rigorous testing of the complete production system. Series production of the new BMW i3 will then ramp up in summer 2026.\n\nTypical iFACTORY: digitally planned and tested\n\nPlant Munich is consistently aligned with the guiding principles of the BMW iFACTORY. Both the new body shop and new assembly line were digitally planned and built from the outset. Existing installations in the press shop and paint shop are also integrated into the BMW Group’s Virtual Factory. This made it possible to conduct functional testing of all technologies for the new vehicle generation virtually and well in advance.\n\nExtensive remodelling completed in just 18 months\n\nIn just 18 months, about a third of the plant grounds has undergone extensive remodelling. Old halls were dismantled, and a new assembly, logistics centre and body shop were built – all while still manufacturing up to 1,000 BMW 3 Series and 4 Series vehicles per day. Series production of the new BMW i3 is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2026."

      "content": "Munich/Salching. The new Cell Recycling Competence Center (CRCC) in Salching in Lower Bavaria has now been officially commissioned – marking a major step forward in implementing innovative direct recycling as a joint project between the BMW Group and Encory GmbH. For construction and operation of the new Competence Center, the BMW Group and Encory are relying on regional partners.\n\nInnovative direct recycling enables reuse of battery raw materials\n\nDirect recycling allows residual materials from battery cell production, including complete battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled. The raw materials are not entirely reverted to their original state, but are instead “directly” fed back into the cell production cycle. This direct recycling methodology, developed by experts from the BMW Group, therefore eliminates the conventional, energy-intensive chemical or thermal processing previously required. At the new CRCC, direct recycling will be scaled up and introduced in stages until, once fully operational, the annual volume of battery cell material recycled will be in the mid-double-digit tonne range. Going forward, the recovered raw materials will be directly reused in pilot production of battery cells at the company’s own Cell Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf.\n\nDirect recycling: A process for the future\n\n“Our direct recycling process puts us at the forefront of the industry,” explains Markus Fallböhmer, SVP of Battery Production at BMW AG. “This technology has tremendous potential to further optimise battery cell production.” It is also conceivable that, for the first time, cell manufacturers could be enabled to use direct recycling in series production.\n\nJoint venture runs Competence Center – IP remains with BMW Group\n\nAn existing hall in Salching in Lower Bavaria (Straubing-Bogen district) will be used for the new Competence Center. In addition to the production area and warehouse space of around 2,100 m², the building also offers just under 350 m² of offices and break rooms, as well as photovoltaic systems on the roof. While the Competence Center will be built and operated by Encory GmbH, the intellectual property for the recycling method is fully owned by the BMW Group. As a joint venture between the BMW Group and the Interzero Group, Encory will develop and implement logistics and consulting solutions, including for recovery, recycling and reconditioning of vehicle components. Both partners hold a 50-percent stake in the company. The new Competence Center will employ about 20 people.\n\nStrong partners from the region\n\nWith the exception of one Swiss company, only German firms were contracted for the construction and operation of the Competence Center. Nearly half of these companies are located within a 100-kilometer radius of Salching.\n\nOptimal location for new Competence Center in Bavaria\n\nThe BMW Group consolidates its battery cell expertise at its Competence Centers in Munich, Parsdorf and Salching. The Battery Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in the north of Munich offers state-of-the-art labs and research facilities for developing the battery cells for next-generation high-voltage batteries and producing them in small quantities. The best battery cell from the BCCC will be scaled up for series processes on a pilot line at the Cell Manufacturing Competence Center (CMCC) in Parsdorf. Recycling of surplus material from pilot production in Parsdorf will take place at the new Cell Recycling Competence Center (CRCC) in Salching. The recovered raw materials will then be reused in cell production, ensuring short distances between all Competence Centers and preventing valuable raw materials from being lost. Following on from the BCCC and CMCC, the CRCC thus represents the next step in the BMW Group’s battery cell strategy on the road to the circular economy.\n\nCircular economy at the BMW Group\n\nThe BMW Group views the circular economy as one of the key issues in shaping more resource-efficient mobility. Its approach is aimed at finding the best ways to keep materials in the cycle – ensuring that resources are not lost, but retain their value for long-term use. The BMW Group applies the principles of Re:Think, Re:Duce, Re:Use and Re:Cycle. From vehicle design and production, to recycling and reuse, everything is geared towards ensuring that vehicles can serve as a source of raw vehicles at the end of their use phase. The BMW Group is taking steps to increase the percentage of recycled materials. It returns selected production residues to the material supplier or material processor, enabling their recovery and reintroduction into a new manufacturing process. In this way, recycled and reused materials are already making their way into BMW Group vehicles today. The circular economy requires holistic thinking – from product design, all the way through to vehicle recycling."

      "content": "Munich. It is well known that there is no such thing as bad weather when riding a motorcycle, only unsuitable clothing. BMW Motorrad took this into account more than four decades ago and was the first motorcycle manufacturer in the world to present its first in-house rider equipment in 1978, in addition to the BMW Motorrad flip-up helmet introduced in 1976. In the decades that followed, BMW Motorrad consistently implemented the maxim of making motorcycling as safe and comfortable as possible and at the same time fashionably attractive and stylish. For the coming season, BMW Motorrad is once again offering numerous innovations and innovative solutions with the 2026 Clothing Collection. Highlight: the new innovative BMW Motorrad System 8 Carbon and System 8 helmets for maximum safety and comfort.The eighth-generation System 8 Carbon flip-up helmet, homologated in accordance with ECE 22.06, offers optimum safety with minimum weight thanks to its helmet shell made of a carbon-aramide-fiberglass mix. The innovative MIPS Integra TX® (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) reduces the rotational movement of the head in the event of an impact and reduces the risk of injury.

The inside zipper makes it easy to put on and take off while the FREELOCK quick-release system enables an optimum fit. Ankle and shin protection as well as integrated reinforcements in the toe and gearshift area ensure safety and comfort. The Allrounder Taunus GORE-TEX boot is a waterproof and breathable touring boot that offers a high level of comfort and reliable protection on motorcycle tours. Made from hard-wearing leather and equipped with a waterproof and breathable PTFE-free GORE-TEX membrane, it is ideal for all weather conditions. The OrthoLite insole ensures a high comfort level. The boot has ankle, shin and shift lever protection as well as a non-slip and oil-repellent rubber sole. The covered zipper and an additional Velcro fastener make them easy to put on and take off. The Taunus GORE-TEX Plus version of the boot offers a 6 cm higher standing height. Adventure seekers will get their money's worth with the Adventure collection. For the coming motorcycle season, it once again offers valuable additions in the area of functional clothing. For example, the GS Coro GORE-TEX jacket (protection class AA), which impresses with its comfortable fit and excellent freedom of movement. Thanks to the GORE-TEX Z-Liner construction with GORE-TEX ePE membrane, it is waterproof, breathable and windproof (water column 28,000 mm). Removable protectors on the elbows and shoulders and a long back protector offer protection, while stretch inserts on the inside of the arms increase freedom of movement and comfort. Fall-prone areas on the elbows are reinforced with a gridded acrylic coating. In addition to the \"2way Climate System\", effective air inlets ensure optimum ventilation. The interior is equipped with a 3D spacer fabric to ventilate the back protector area. A specially tailored women's cut with infinitely variable waist adjuster ensures the perfect silhouette, while press studs and Velcro fasteners at the cuffs allow the width of the sleeves to be adjusted. The width of the collar and jacket hem can be adjusted using press studs or an elasticated band. A short zipper and an all-round zipper allow the jacket, which is available in black and olive for men and women, to be worn with matching trousers. The matching GS Coro GORE-TEX trousers, also available for men and women in black and olive, offer a comfortable fit and excellent freedom of movement. They are also waterproof, breathable and windproof. Removable protectors on the hips and knees offer additional protection and stretch inserts increase comfort. The Reschen GORE-TEX gloves made from a leather/textile mix are the perfect match for this suit and are an indispensable companion for extended rides: the touring gloves provide superior protection against wind and weather and the breathable GORE-TEX X-TRAFIT membrane reliably keeps out water and cold. Leather reinforcements, highly abrasion-resistant SuperFabric® and a soft knuckle protector round off the robust overall package, while the goatskin leather palm, thumbs and index fingers with tactile leather for smartphone operation ensure a high level of comfort and ease of use. They are already available in the color anthracite and will be available in the new color olive in 2026. The GS Tabernas GORE-TEX boot in black and olive was specially developed for off-road and on-road use. A modern enduro boot made of leather with plastic elements that offers a perfect balance of high comfort and optimum protection. Thanks to the PTFE-free GORE-TEX membrane, the boot is breathable and waterproof. The internal lacing system and two external buckles ensure stability and mobility. An oil and fuel-resistant VIBRAM® tread sole ensures optimum grip even on loose surfaces. Shin protection and shift lever protection ensure safety and comfort. The OrthoLite insole offers a high level of comfort and temperature-regulating properties. The iconic light design of the BMW R 1300 GS is taken up as a graphic in the shin guard and heel cap. The waterproof GS Takyr GORE-TEX sneaker made from a 3D knitted fabric in black and blue combines functionality and comfort and is perfect for the road and outdoor activities. The breathable and waterproof PTFE-free GORE-TEX membrane defies all weathers. The stable, oil and fuel-resistant VIBRAM® Traction Lug sole offers lateral stability and optimum grip, even on loose ground. Thanks to the high-quality materials, the shoe not only offers protection from wind and weather, but also excellent cushioning and durability. The FREELOCK quick-release system ensures an optimum fit. The side zipper on the inside allows easy entry. A large TPU gearshift, toe and side protection offer comprehensive safety and comfort. The OrthoLite insole offers temperature-regulating properties. The GS Rallye Carbon helmet (ECE 22.06 homologated) offers state-of-the-art safety technology and is based on the design of the GS models. The innovative MIPS Integra TX® (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) reduces the rotational movement of the head in the event of an impact and reduces the risk of injury. Thanks to two helmet shell sizes, the M-Forge® carbon/aramid-fibre mix helmet shell is only as large as is actually necessary. The helmet is available in black and in the Tramontana, Trophy, Calama, Lima and Nasca designs. The GS Rallye helmet (ECE 22.06 homologated) is another ideal companion for on- and off-road adventures. An efficient ventilation system ensures optimum climate comfort. Here too, the helmet shell made of glass fiber-reinforced M-Forge® is available in two sizes and is therefore only as large as necessary. It is available in white, matt gray, black and neon yellow. Both helmet variants offer impact absorption values and a safety performance at the highest level and very balanced aerodynamics on and off-road as well as a Pull Rescue system for removing the cheek pads before removing the helmet (in the event of an accident). The infinitely adjustable sun visor as well as the specially developed visor mechanism with quick release and the removable helmet shield with self-locking mechanism offer the greatest possible ease of use. The Pinlock 120 XLT® inner lens ensures perfect anti-fog protection. The outer visor has a scratch-resistant coating. The chin section with dust filter has a removable flap for maximum air flow for off-road use. Both helmet models can be upgraded with the newly developed BMW Motorrad ConnectedRide communication system. The GS Rallye GORE-TEX jacket (protection class AA) with a functional, quick-drying and breathable material blend is perfect for off-road and on-road use. The clever ventilation options on the chest, back, shoulders and arms as well as the AirVent insert in the front area as an additional ventilation option guarantee a high level of comfort in warm to moderate temperatures. Thanks to the waterproof 3-layer laminate GORE-TEX outserts with a 28,000 mm water column (included with the blue color - optionally available with the black color of the jacket), the jacket offers outstanding performance even in bad weather. The integrated storm hood in the collar of the outserts keeps wind, weather and dirt out of the collar, while the soft fabric part acts as a storm hood under the helmet for additional warmth. The waterproof GORE-TEX outer material defies bad weather. A specially developed carrying system allows the jacket to be worn like a rucksack, leaving your hands free, which is convenient and comfortable for city tours or breaks. The jacket is available for men and women in blue/red and black. It is complemented by the optimally ventilated GS Rallye trousers – sold with or without an outsert (according to the color logic of the jacket). The GS Rallye gloves, made from a lightweight, breathable material mix in blue/red, are the ideal companion for all bikers who ride off-road in warm temperatures. The backhand is made of elastic textile in combination with goatskin for ideal comfort. The large knuckle protection is ideally prepared for the stresses and strains of off-road use while the kangaroo leather palm with reinforcements offers maximum grip. The summer glove with long cuff is also available in black and sand. The GS Rallye GORE-TEX gloves, available in black, are also designed for off-road use. The goatskin leather palm provides best possible grip. A large knuckle shell made of hard plastic, lined with shock-absorbing foam, protects against impacts. The all-season gloves with a long cuff for road and off-road use are windproof, waterproof and breathable thanks to the GORE-TEX membrane and offer an optimum fit. The gloves are also available in anthracite/white. The GS Trophy GORE-TEX jacket (protection class AA) in blue/red has been uncompromisingly developed for sporty and active riding, even off the beaten track. The extremely lightweight, robust and highly elastic polyamide softshell technology with innovative ventilation options ensures a comfortable fit in high temperatures. Together with the supplied very robust 3-layer GORE-TEX laminate outer jacket (water column 28,000 mm) the GS Trophy GORE-TEX jacket is a comfortable companion even at low temperatures. As part of the Adventure collection, it features the iconic light design of theBMW R 1300 GS as a graphic element. The outer jacket can also be worn seperately as an outdoor jacket. As an additional highlight the jacket features an integrated pocket for the Hydra TrinkPak for physically demanding rides. The GS Trophy GORE-TEX trousers in blue provide the perfect complement and have also been uncompromisingly developed for sporty and active riding. The extremely lightweight, robust and elastic softshell technology with innovative ventilation and the GORE-TEX outer shell ensure a pleasant climate. Sporty, ambitious motorcyclists as well as racetrack cracks will find everything their biker heart desires in the Sport collection. For example, the Nitrous sneaker, a light and airy sneaker in BMW M Motorsport design made from a breathable 3D knitted fabric. It offers the best wearing comfort with very good impact absorption values. The comfortable, lightweight and oil- and fuel-resistant sole in a two-tone design with BMW Motorrad logo and \"M\" inlay makes it ideal for motorsport enthusiasts. The TPU-reinforced parts in particularly stressed areas, such as the toe and ankle, offer additional comfort and protection. With the Urban Mobility collection, BMW Motorrad offers practical and stylish products that are ideal for everyday motorcycling, but are also absolutely suitable for everyday use off the bike. Be it a stroll through town, shopping or just sitting in a café. Take the Tokyo GORE-TEX jacket in olive, for example. Thanks to the three-layer, windproof, waterproof and breathable GORE-TEX Pro 3-layer material (water column 28,000 mm), the AirVent ventilation system and the removable inner jacket, this comfortable parka in a streetwear look with a casual fit and dropped sleeves can be used all year round. The full-length front zipper offers a clever dual function: two waterproof outer pockets with the zipper open from the top and more legroom with the zipper open from the bottom. The Tokyo GORE-TEX jacket also features a detachable, adjustable hood and two inside pockets. The lightweight and airy Ginza sneaker made from a breathable 3D knitted fabric in black, blue and brown are a perfect match. It combines a sporty look with optimum comfort in dry weather. Thanks to the robust, lightweight and oil- and fuel-resistant sole with BMW Motorrad inlay, TPU-reinforced surfaces in the gearshift and toe area and excellent cushioning properties, the modern, sporty sneaker is ideally suited to the demands of everyday motorcycling. Thanks to a side zipper they are also easy to put on. With the Schwabing LTD Edition jacket (protection class AA),BMW Motorrad has reissued a classic in a limited edition. Each jacket is unique thanks to the embroidered serial number. The black jacket with the metal BMW emblem on the sleeve impresses with the highest material and manufacturing quality. Its premium, water-repellent and slightly elastic nubuck leather is hand-selected. Ventilation options and two outside and three inside pockets maximize comfort and usability. The Grand Racer helmet (homologated in accordance with ECE 22.06) in the new color matt black combines the charm of earlier motorcycle days with modern functionality. It not only goes along perfectly with the Schwabing LTD Edition jacket, but also with the BMW Motorrad Heritage models in general. What sets it apart from other helmets in retro design is above all its pleasant aeroacoustics. High-quality materials and details made of brass and copper complete the classic look. Thanks to four different helmet shell sizes, the Premium Heritage helmet is only as big as absolutely necessary in each size.

Accordingly, the goal is to be fully competitive and fight for the world title.\"\n\nDan Harper (#69 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, FIA WEC): \"The FIA WEC is a new racing series with new circuits for me. I'm extremely excited to be competing in an official FIA World Championship. The highlight will obviously be Le Mans. I am proud to have made it this far to be able to take part in this event. I have gained a lot of experience working with Bronze drivers over the past few years. My first impression of Parker and Anthony is very good. Together with Team WRT we will certainly have a lot of fun and form a strong team. Before that, I'm looking forward to returning to Daytona with Paul Miller Racing. It's a fantastic race and the four of us drivers should be strong enough to have a good chance of winning in our class.\"\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, IMSA Series): \"I can't wait to contest the full IMSA season with Paul Miller Racing in 2026. I think we have a very strong driver line-up, which proved last season that it can win races and regularly compete at the front. With Neil at my side, the goal is to win the first overall title for Paul Miller Racing in GTD PRO.\"\n\nNeil Verhagen (#1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, IMSA Series): \"I'm thrilled to be competing with Paul Miller Racing for my second full IMSA season. Last year I learnt a lot about the championship. While 2025 had a lot of good moments, there was also a lot to improve on. I'm looking forward to working with Connor and our new engineer throughout the season. I can't wait to start 2026 in this constellation.\"\n\nRobby Foley (#96 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, IMSA Series): \"I think it's great that we have such consistency in the driver line-up at Turner Motorsport.

He takes over from Dirk Häcker, who enters retirement after 11 years at BMW M and 37 years with the BMW Group.\n\nFranciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, says: “Dirk Häcker’s departure sees the long-term Head of Development at BMW M GmbH bow out to start his well-earned retirement. His name is inextricably linked with an unprecedented product offensive, superior product quality and yearly sales records at BMW M. We are delighted to have found in Alexander Karajlovic an expert who, in addition to having worked at BMW M before, comes with a proven track record of chassis development know-how enabling him to take the helm and continue this legacy of success.”\n\nAlexander Karajlovic is familiar with BMW M GmbH, having held various other management positions in the past. From November 2017 to the end of 2020 he was in charge of the sub-line of X derivatives and project manager for the BMW XM. As a result, he has been closely associated with the high-performance brand’s electrification. He had a strong influence on BMW M products from 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2023, serving as Vice President for the BMW M Product Line. He then spent several years in BMW Group Development, working in the areas of Requirements, Concepts and Driving Experience Integration. Now Alexander Karajlovic is coming back to BMW M GmbH.\n\nDirk Häcker has been with the BMW Group since 1988, and in leading positions focused on driving dynamics and later vehicle development since 2001. From 2015 he was in charge of Development at BMW M GmbH. What makes Dirk Häcker’s career in the automotive industry unusual is that he complemented his leadership career with that of a long-term driving instructor for the BMW Driving Experience. This again underlines his passion for BMW M as much as his competence in the area of driving dynamics."

      "content": "Munich. MINI remains true to its claim: “Less is more”, focusing on what really matters. With this approach, MINI makes an important contribution to shaping the future in a more conscious and sustainable way. This commitment is particularly reflected in the current MINI generation, for example through the use of innovative and recycled materials in the interior.\n\nKnit partially made from Recyclate – Sustainability You Can Feel\n\nIn line with the \"Secondary First\" principle, MINI uses knit from recycled materials in all models starting with the market launch in 2024. The knitted material consists of 92% polyester recyclate and is used for dashboard upholstery, door trim, and center console lid. This significantly reduces CO2e emissions and water consumption in production compared to primary materials.\n\nDesign, Function, and Sustainability\n\nThe specially developed knitted look gives the interior of the MINI family a distinctive look and opens up new possibilities for individual colour and pattern worlds. It enables a two-colour design with an impressive depth effect. This effect occurs when the colour of the lower textile layer subtly shines through the upper layer. This structure, inspired by sneaker design and carefully further developed, gives the surfaces visual complexity and ensures a high-quality, unique look in the interior. The components are also abrasion-resistant, structurally reinforced, and completely leather-free.\n\nThe new BMW iX3 also relies on this innovative technology: In the \"Contemporary\" trim of the first model of the Neue Klasse, the knit of the instrument panel is made of 75% recycled material – a clear commitment to the principle of \"Design for Circularity\". While the light in the MINI family is projected onto the dashboard, the lighting in the BMW iX3 comes from the rear. For this, the knit pattern was deliberately designed to be more translucent so that the new backlighting comes into its own optimally.\n\nStronger Together: Collaboration is Key\n\nThe textile solution for the MINI interior was made ready for series production in close collaboration with internal and external partners: cross-industry and cross-departmental cooperation proves to be the key to innovations in sustainability. Close cooperation with partners generates new impulses and solutions that further advance sustainable materials and processes and enable the development of future-oriented products.\n\nThis innovative strength was recently honoured: MINI Knit is the overall winner of the SPE Automotive Award 2025 and winner of the Grand Award in the \"Body Interior\" category. The award is one of the most prestigious honors in the plastics industry. The Grand Award is presented for the best submission across all categories.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n\nBMW Group Corporate Communications\n\nDr. Cornelia Bovensiepen, Spokesperson Product Sustainability\n\nTelephone: +49 151 601 94935\n\nMedia website: www.press.bmwgroup.com\n\nWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services. The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide; the company has a global sales network in more than 140 countries.\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion.

      "content": "+++ Over 18 million BMW 3 Series built worldwide +++ Manufactured at 18 plants in 13 countries since 1975 +++ A driving force for the production network and a trailblazer for the BMW iFACTORY +++\n\nMunich. Built on four continents, the BMW 3 Series has been one of the most important products in the BMW Group’s international production network for 50 years. Since manufacturing began in 1975, the BMW 3 Series has rolled off the assembly line more than 18 million times at 18 plants across 13 countries. Core themes of the BMW iFACTORY – such as efficiency, flexibility, digitalisation and resource-efficient production – thread consistently throughout the production history of the BMW 3 Series.\n\nBMW Group Plant Munich: Origins and role as a technology pioneer\n\nThe main plant in Munich has been the centre of BMW 3 Series production since 1975. From an early stage, the BMW Group committed to flexible manufacturing at the site, enabled by modern technologies, such as overhead conveyor systems and freely programmable welding machines. A fully-automated body shop was introduced in Munich in 1982 for the second generation of the BMW 3 Series. Through the use of industrial robots, it was possible to achieve an automation rate of more than 90 percent for this technology. Supplemented by flexible shift systems and modified work-time models, capacity increased significantly. Continuous modernisation, from powder coating technologies to computer-controlled engine production, ensured that the facility always remained state-of-the-art. Today, the plant deploys numerous digitalisation applications and AI-supported quality systems. In this way, the BMW 3 Series has consistently been a major driving force for the technological development of BMW Group production.\n\nBMW 3 Series as a driver of growth and internationalisation\n\nVolume growth at the plants was also influenced by the BMW 3 Series. In 1980, 3 Series production expanded from the main plant in Munich to Plant Dingolfing, and later to Plant Regensburg in 1986. The BMW 3 Series also provided the momentum for the internationalisation of BMW production. In the 1980s, additional production lines were established at other sites, including Rosslyn, South Africa (from 1984) and Spartanburg in the United States (from 1994). These locations enabled local supply for their respective markets and laid the foundations for the company’s global distribution of value creation – today, a key feature of the BMW Group production network.\n\nThe BMW 3 Series – an enabler for new plants\n\nSince the opening of the Regensburg plant, the BMW 3 Series has served as the enabler for all new BMW plants – with the exception of the facility in Debrecen. The plants in Spartanburg, Leipzig and San Luis Potosí, as well as the BBA joint venture in China, all initially ramped up with the BMW 3 Series. Over the decades, various 3 Series derivatives – ranging from sedans and convertibles to Touring and M versions – have been produced at nearly all BMW Group plants with maximum flexibility. Multiple derivatives and different drive technologies – vehicles with internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids and fully-electric drive trains – all come off the same assembly line.\n\nToday, the seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series is produced in Munich, Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and at the company's own regional plants in Chennai (India), Rayong (Thailand) and Araquari (Brazil), as well as at partner plants in further countries.\n\nPreparations for the eighth generation of the successful model series are proceeding in parallel: A fully-electric version of the BMW 3 Series will ramp up at Plant Munich from the second half of 2026 as the next vehicle of the NEUE KLASSE, with subsequent production in China and Mexico. A return of the BMW 3 Series to Plant Dingolfing is also planned.\n\nSeven generations of the BMW 3 Series across the production network (full plants)\n\n1st generation 3 Series\n\n2nd generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Convertible, Touring, M3 (Coupé and Convertible)\n\nMunich, Dingolfing, Regensburg, Rosslyn (South Africa)\n\n3rd generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Coupé, Convertible, Touring, Compact, M3 (Sedan, Coupé, Convertible)\n\nMunich, Dingolfing, Regensburg, Spartanburg (USA), Rosslyn (South Africa)\n\n4th generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Coupé, Convertible, Touring, Compact, M3 (Coupé, Convertible)\n\nMunich, Dingolfing, Regensburg, Rosslyn (South Africa)\n\n5th generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Coupé, Convertible, Touring, M3 (Sedan, Coupé, Convertible)\n\nMunich, Regensburg, Rosslyn (South Africa), Dadong (China), Leipzig\n\n6th generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Touring, Gran Turismo, M3 (Sedan)\n\nThe Sedan, Touring and Gran Turismo continued to be marketed as the BMW 3 Series, while the Convertible, Coupé and new Gran Coupé formed a separate family for the first time: the BMW 4 Series range.\n\nMunich, Dingolfing, Regensburg, Rosslyn (South Africa), Tiexi (China)\n\n7th generation 3 Series\n\nSedan, Touring, M3 (Sedan, Touring), i3 (fully-electric, China only)\n\nMunich, Tiexi (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico)\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nSandra Schillmöller, Head of Communications Production Network BMW Group\n\nCell phone: +49-151-601-12225\n\nMartina Hatzel, Communications Production Network BMW Group\n\nCell phone: +49-151-601-11966\n\nMedia website: www.press.bmwgroup.com/deutschland\n\nWith its four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services.

At the end of the third season of the Hypercar in North America, the results included four poles, a 1-2 finish at Road America (USA), and two third-places at Long Beach and Laguna Seca (both USA). In the drivers' standings, Vanthoor and Philipp Eng (AUT) finished fourth. The FIA WEC season also started strongly with a front-row start in Qatar and second place in the race at Imola (ITA). However, the second half of the season was disappointing for BMW M Team WRT.\n\nFacts and figures: The BMW M Hybrid V8 completed over 70,000 racing kilometres in the 2025 season, approximately 39,000 in the FIA WEC and around 31,000 in the IMSA Series. During 36 test days, nearly 33,000 test kilometres were covered – around 23,000 in the FIA WEC and approximately 10,000 in the IMSA Series.\n\nGT3: Triumphant season with a highlight at the Nürburgring. The 2025 season with the BMW M4 GT3 was almost a continuous triumph. It began in February with a 1-2 finish at the Bathurst 12 Hour (AUS), the last race of the old model. The EVO version seamlessly continued the success story. The highlight was ROWE Racing's victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), marking BMW M Motorsport's 21st overall win in the \"Green Hell\". Other major individual successes with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO included Team WRT's wins at the Suzuka 1000KM (JPN) and the Indianapolis 8 Hour (USA), as well as Paul Miller Racing's triumphs in the GTD-PRO class at the 6 Hours of the Glen and Petit Le Mans (both USA). Key title wins in 2025 included the drivers' and teams' titles in the GT World Challenge Europe with Team WRT, as well as the drivers' and manufacturers' titles in the Intercontinental GT Challenge, where BMW M Motorsport achieved four wins in five season races. Additionally, the GTD-PRO drivers', teams', and manufacturers' titles in the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup were secured. Driver of the season was Kelvin van der Linde (RSA). In his debut year as a BMW M works driver, he won the 24h Nürburgring and the drivers' titles in the GT World Challenge Europe (Overall and Sprint standings) and the Intercontinental GT Challenge.\n\nFacts and figures: 56 BMW M4 GT3s were in action worldwide during the 2025 season, most of them EVO models. More than 80 victories and 100 additional podium finishes were achieved, and over 400,000 racing kilometres were completed.\n\nGT4: Over 100 victories – biggest triumphs at the Nürburgring. The smaller sibling of the BMW M4 GT3 also achieved impressive successes in the 2025 season. The biggest triumphs came at the Nürburgring. At the 24-hour race, Team AV Racing by BLACK FALCON won the SP10 class with the EVO version of the car. FK Performance Motorsport triumphed in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) in nine out of ten races in the SP8T category, securing the overall NLS victory for drivers Nick Wüstenhagen (GER) and Ranko Mijatovic (SUI). While titles were not achieved in the major European GT4 racing series – the GT European Series and ADAC GT4 Germany – the BMW M4 GT4 EVO dominated in GT4 America across all classes. Thanks to consistently strong results from GT4 teams, BMW M Motorsport secured the SRO manufacturers' title in the GT4 class.\n\nFacts and figures: 88 BMW M4 GT4s were in racing action worldwide in 2025. They achieved over 100 victories and around 150 additional podium finishes. BMW M Motorsport teams covered approximately 330,000 racing kilometres.\n\nEsports World Cup: Successfully defended title. BMW M Motorsport is also highly active in virtual racing, and its three automotive gaming teams continued their success streak in 2025. The highlight was the Esports World Cup (EWC), a four-day competition on the \"Rennsport\" platform. BMW M Team Redline triumphed for the second consecutive time with drivers Luke Bennett (GBR), Sebastian Job (GBR), Jeffrey Rietveld (NED), and Kevin Siggy (SLO).\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Overall, we at BMW M Motorsport look back on a very successful 2025 season. Many thanks to everyone whose hard work contributed to this record. With our BMW M Hybrid V8, the conclusion is mixed. In the first half of the season, we were very satisfied with the car's pace in both the IMSA Series and the FIA WEC. Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve the corresponding race results. While we celebrated the 1-2 finish at Road America in the second half of the season, we generally had higher expectations. We will analyse in detail over the winter what caused this, so we can return much stronger in 2026 with the updated version of our car. With the BMW M4 GT3, we had an almost dream season. The title wins in some of the most important GT3 racing series and the individual victories at the Nürburgring and Bathurst were major highlights. In the DTM, we fought for the title until the last race and stood on the podium multiple times in the FIA WEC. I am also very pleased with the BMW M4 GT4's strong performance. This car symbolises our close connection to customer racing, whose heart lies in the GT4 category. In 2026, the BMW M2 Racing will be added as a new entry-level car, completing our portfolio of customer racing cars. I can't wait for the action to resume in January after a well-deserved Christmas break.\""

      "content": "Munich/Paris. 2026 will be a special year for photography as we celebrate the bicentenary of its creation. Nicéphore Niépce, a visionary inventor from the early 19th century, is widely recognised as having produced the first permanent photograph in 1826, thereby sparking a visual revolution that continues to shape the way we see the world today. the world today. Less well known but equally influential, Nicéphore, along with his brother Claude, was also a pioneer of the internal combustion engine, an invention that profoundly transformed mobility and our daily lives. These two major advances, photography and the internal combustion engine, have brought about fundamental technological and cultural changes. It is in this spirit that BMW, at the crossroads of mobility and creativity, is passionately committed to photographic patronage, notably at the Niépce Museum in Chalon-sur-Saône, where the BMW residency was born in 2010, before launching the BMW ART MAKERS programme in 2021. Evolution and progress come through knowledge: these inventions provide rich material for artists and curators to think about and create, inviting them to imagine new forms of expression and reflection.\n\nCall for applicationsTo celebrate the bicentenary of photography in 2026, the BMW ART MAKERS programme invites applicants to honour this heritage while imagining forward-looking projects. Echoing Niépce’s pioneering spirit, this exceptional edition encourages the exploration of the links between image, innovation and transformation, in a context where creativity and responsibility come together.\n\nSince 1826, photography has stood at the heart of cultural and technological change—an ambition now shared by BMW through its commitment to more intelligent, more human-centered and more sustainable mobility. Artist–curator duos are therefore invited to propose a project that reimagines our relationship with the image, movement and progress.\n\nThe call for applications is open until 31 December 2025 at 11:59 p.m. The winning duo will be announced in January 2026.\n\nBMW ART MAKERS: financial, material and human support that includes\n\nPractical informationIn particular, the project should:\n\nApplications are open until 31 December 2025 on the dedicated BMW ART MAKERS application platform.

Supporting creativity means supporting those who are shaping the future.\n\nThis commitment is exemplified in its longstanding partnerships—23 years with Paris Photo and 15 years with the Rencontres Photographiques d’Arles. By supporting the international art scene, BMW offers decisive visibility to emerging talents, many of whom have since achieved major recognition, reaffirming the relevance of this engagement. This dialogue between artistic innovation, society and business reflects a shared ambition: to safeguard the future of culture and make it accessible to all, today and for generations to come.\n\nFrom Frank Stella to Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons and the emerging artists of the BMW Residency and the BMW ART MAKERS programme, BMW has spent decades promoting new artistic perspectives and the hybridisation of techniques across contemporary art, music, architecture, design, photography and the visual arts.

      "content": "Munich. For the 63rd time, BMW M Motorsport honoured its most successful customer racing drivers and teams of the past season on Saturday evening in Garching near Munich (GER). At the BMW M Night of Trophies, the Sports Trophy Awards went to the USA and Germany. In the drivers' standings, Justin Rothberg (USA) claimed victory for the second consecutive year. FK Performance Motorsport secured first place in the team standings.\n\nThe annual conclusion of the BMW M Sports Trophy has a long tradition. It is the evening when private teams and drivers take centre stage for BMW M Motorsport, acting as ambassadors for the BMW M brand with their racing efforts around the world. The importance of these customers was underscored by the presence of Sylvia Neubauer, Vice President Customer, Brand, Sales at BMW M GmbH, who is now a regular guest at the BMW M Night of Trophies, and Head of BMW M Motorsport Andreas Roos.\n\nAs part of the BMW M Sports Trophy, private teams and drivers collect points for the final standings based on their results in their respective racing series. In the drivers' standings, Justin Rothberg once again claimed first place, scoring 930 points to edge out the duo of Berkay Besler (TUR) and Gabriele Piana (ITA), who tied with 858 points. Driving the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for Turner Motorsport, Rothberg won two titles. He triumphed in GT America and, alongside BMW M works driver Robby Foley (USA), claimed victory in the Pro-Am category of the GT World Challenge America.\n\nIn the team standings, there was a close duel between two German teams for the win. FK Performance Motorsport ultimately prevailed with 1,676 points, narrowly beating Schubert Motorsport (1,620 points). Third place went to last year's winners, Turner Motorsport (1,576 points). FK Performance Motorsport achieved a milestone in 2025 by becoming the first team to win the overall standings of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) with the BMW M4 GT4. At the 24-hour race on the Nordschleife, the team reached the podium in its class. With the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, FK Performance Motorsport played a leading role in the ADAC GT Masters, finishing second in the team standings.\n\nDuring the BMW M Night of Trophies, the new members of the BMW M Racing Academy, BMW M Motorsport's support programme for customer racing, were officially introduced. The \"Class of 2026\" consists of German Thomas Rackl, American Josh Green, and Australian Ryder Quinn. The trio shared the stage with BMW M Racing Academy mentors Jens Klingmann, Max Hesse (both GER), and Robby Foley.\n\nComments on the BMW M Night of Trophies.\n\nFranciscus van Meel (CEO of BMW M GmbH): \"It is truly special to welcome our most successful customer racers to Garching, where the heart of BMW M beats. They perfectly embody the DNA of our brand and, with their performances on racetracks around the world, serve as ideal ambassadors. While we celebrate the victories and titles of our works drivers and teams, our emotional connection to customer racing is equally profound. Without it, BMW M Motorsport would not be the same. It is a central pillar of our racing programme and will remain so in the future. I congratulate this year's winners, Justin Rothberg and FK Performance Motorsport, as well as all other award recipients tonight, on their fantastic achievements during the past season.\"\n\nSylvia Neubauer (Vice President Customer, Brand, Sales at BMW M GmbH): \"An evening like this fills me with pride. Pride in the successes of our teams and drivers, but also pride in the incredible group of personalities we have once again brought together under the umbrella of the BMW M Sports Trophy this year. I am also proud of the achievements of our engineers, who have hit the mark with the EVO versions of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4. The successes of both cars in their debut seasons are impressive. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this. And congratulations to tonight's winners, Justin Rothberg and FK Performance Motorsport!\"\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"We look back with pride on an impressive customer racing season. In 2025, we had 56 GT3 and 88 GT4 cars in action worldwide, collectively covering over 700,000 racing kilometres and achieving around 180 victories and 250 additional podium finishes across various classes. Our customer racing drivers and teams celebrated victories and titles in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. This underlines how globally successful our BMW M Sports Trophy family is. The best driver, as in 2024, was Justin Rothberg. His performances in the cockpit of the BMW M4 GT3 EVO have been outstanding. For the second consecutive year, he dominated the U.S. SRO racing series in his class. Personally, I am also very pleased with the second-place finish of our BMW M Racing Academy member Berkay Besler. FK Performance Motorsport rewarded themselves with the triumph in the team standings for their fantastic commitment to the BMW M brand, with numerous cars in both the GT3 and GT4 segments. Congratulations to all the winners!\"\n\nJustin Rothberg: \"Super thrilled to be winning the Sports Trophy again this year. The BMWs are great race cars and there’s so many talented drivers so it’s an accomplishment I’m proud of. It’s a testament to the great work from all the guys at Turner Motorsport: Will Turner for running such a well oiled machine, Robby Foley for always putting in great drives and giving me the help and advice I need – and my parents for supporting me and putting me in a position to succeed.\"\n\nFabian Finck, Team Principal FK Performance Motorsport: \"It is a great challenge every year to compete against so many great teams within the Sports Trophy. We can only do our best again and again, and this year we were lucky enough to come first. We are very proud of that. Overall, we had a great season with a great team performance. In the end, we lacked a bit of luck here and there and didn't quite achieve our championship goals. But we'll be going for it again next season.\""

      "content": "Munich. BMW M Motorsport's support programme for customer racing enters its second round in 2026. In an intensive selection process held in Munich (GER), twelve candidates from ten nations applied for a spot in the \"Class of 2026\" of the BMW M Racing Academy. Ultimately, BMW M Motorsport officials selected three drivers who will benefit from an exclusive programme next year: German Thomas Rackl, American Josh Green, and Australian Ryder Quinn. Following the successful completion of the \"Class of 2025,\" which included Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP), Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER), the two-day screening of candidates for the second season of the BMW M Racing Academy took place at the end of October. Twelve young talents, aiming to drive the BMW M4 GT4 in the upcoming customer racing season, were selected from a large pool of applicants to face various challenges in Munich under the watchful eyes of BMW M Motorsport officials. They underwent practical driving contests in BMW M models guided by the BMW M Driving Experience, mental and fitness tests conducted by Formula Medicine experts, an Esports challenge on the racing simulator, as well as driver and media interviews. The candidates' performances were observed and evaluated not only by experts from the respective fields but also by the three mentors of the BMW M Racing Academy – BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann, Max Hesse (both GER), and Robby Foley (USA). This trio had already served as advisors during the \"Class of 2025,\" providing valuable insights into the work of professional racing drivers. Klingmann, Hesse, and Foley will intensify their roles in 2026. Three drivers from three continents were selected for the \"Class of 2026.\" Representing Germany is Thomas Rackl. The 17-year-old competed for the ME Motorsport Team in the ADAC GT4 Germany over the past two seasons. In 2025, he finished seventh overall and fifth in the junior standings in the BMW M4 GT4 EVO alongside Linus Hahne (GER). In 2023, he secured second place in the German Kart Championship. From the USA, Josh Green joins the programme. The 23-year-old excelled in his first full GT season in 2025, driving the BMW M4 GT4 EVO for Random Vandals Racing in GT4 America. Partnering with Sam Craven (USA), he claimed the Pro-Am category title with five wins and nine podium finishes. Ryder Quinn is the first Australian member of the BMW M Racing Academy. The 20-year-old competed in the GT4 Australia in 2025 with the BMW M4 GT4, finishing fourth overall in the Silver-Am category alongside Steve Jakic (AUS). The duo achieved one victory. In 2023, Quinn was a Michelin Junior in the Australian Porsche Carrera Cup, and in 2021, he became the Formula Ford Champion. The programme for the BMW M Racing Academy \"Class of 2026\" will be announced at a later date. Comments on the \"Class of 2026\". Björn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"We are entering our second season with the BMW M Racing Academy, and I am very proud of the programme we launched in 2025. The focus is clearly on the academy concept. Our 'Class of 2026' now has the unique opportunity to spend a year gaining insights into the work of BMW M Motorsport, which can significantly advance their own racing careers. Our three BMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann, Max Hesse, and Robby Foley are perfectly suited as mentors with their open-minded approach. The participants can learn an incredible amount from them. I am very much looking forward to the coming year.\" Jens Klingmann (Mentor BMW M Racing Academy): \"All twelve candidates who participated in the selection process can be proud of their achievements. They all have what it takes to build a successful career in motorsport. I am very excited to work with Josh, Ryder, and Thomas in 2026. As the name 'Academy' suggests, we will coach the three in many areas – driving, mental and physical training, writing reports, media work – in all aspects that will help them progress as racing drivers. We mentors are there for them, always accessible and ready to share our knowledge and experience. Our goal is to improve their foundation, enabling them to take the next steps in their careers.\" Max Hesse (Mentor BMW M Racing Academy): \"The selection days were very exciting. We had twelve very strong candidates in Munich, which says a lot about the high level of our GT4 programme. As a member of the BMW Junior Team, I can relate very well to the 'Class of 2026' and am closest to them in age. Alongside Jens, with his vast experience not only as a driver but also as a developer of racing cars, and Robby, with his customer racing and Esports background – I think we mentors complement each other perfectly.\" Robby Foley (Mentor BMW M Racing Academy): \"We presented our candidates with many different challenges during the selection process. All twelve were very mature for their age and impressed us. Even though only three made it into the 'Class of 2026,' I believe all of them have the potential for a great career in motorsport. I saw parts of myself in them. I also come from customer racing, so it is an honour for me to support them as a mentor with my experiences.\" Josh Green: \"Being part of the BMW M Racing Academy is a big step in the right direction for my career as a racing driver. Everyone entering sports car racing dreams of being associated with a manufacturer – and especially one with as much tradition and history as BMW M Motorsport. From the 'Class of 2026,' I hope to improve in terms of car dynamics and development, areas that interest me greatly. Additionally, I hope to make and deepen many connections.\" Ryder Quinn: \"It was very special to experience during the selection days what a major manufacturer like BMW M Motorsport has to offer. Now being part of the 'Class of 2026' is a great honour. I always wanted to represent a manufacturer, and in a way, I am now doing that for customer racing in Australia. I am very excited to absorb as much as possible from what BMW M Motorsport offers me. Above all, the close contact with the mentors will be very valuable for me. This opportunity is fantastic.\" Thomas Rackl: \"Just being one of the selected candidates for the assessment centre was already a great honour for me. Now being one of only three participants worldwide in the 'Class of 2026' is absolutely amazing. Our mentors are great guys, not just in terms of their sporting achievements but also as people. I expect a lot from working with them. I am sure I can learn an incredible amount from them and am really looking forward to it.\""

Wenyi Ding (CHN, -16) finished in second place.\n\nPuig put in an impressive performance on the way to his first victory on the DP World Tour, recording 13 birdies on his last 40 holes without dropping a single shot. Third place was shared by the winner of the 2017 BMW Championship, Marc Leishman (AUS), and Nick Voke (NZL, both -15). Min Woo Lee (AUS), the 2023 BMW PGA Champion, and Daniel Hillier (NZL, both -14) finished tied for fifth place ahead of major champion and former world number one Adam Scott (AUS, -13).\n\n“It means the world for sure. I was really looking forward to that first professional win on the DP World,” said Puig. \"I was pretty close a few times throughout the last couple of years, but I wasn’t able to get it done. My name being with Seve’s name as the only two Spaniards to have won this prestigious event makes it even more special.“\n\nThe BMW Australian PGA Championship had already started with a bang. In the first round, Australian Daniel Gale (-12, T8) scored an ace on the 11th hole (par 3), for which he was rewarded with the Hole in One Prize, the all-new BMW M5 Touring. After the round, the 29-year-old said that it was a predicted shot: “I played in the pro-am and I said, ‘this baby's mine’ – and it actually happened so it’s pretty crazy.“\n\nThe BMW PGA Australian Championship was the first of three BMW title tournaments on the DP World Tour calendar. It will be followed by the BMW International Open (July 1-5, 2026, Golfclub München Eichenried, GER) and the ‘Festival of Golf’, the BMW PGA Championship (September 15-20, 2026, Wentworth Club, ENG).

      "content": "Munich, 2 December 2025. The BMW Group has defined a new 2035 milestone for cutting CO2e emissions on the road to net zero. The company aims to reduce its CO2e emissions by at least 60 million metric tons compared to 2019 levels, an additional reduction of approximately 20 million tons of CO2e beyond the existing 2030 target.\n\nIn doing so, the BMW Group is pursuing a comprehensive decarbonization strategy along the entire life cycle, with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050 at the latest. This represents a firm commitment to the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. To date, the target has been to cut at least 40 million metric tons of CO2e across the entire life cycle (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2030 compared to 2019 levels. The new 2035 milestone is a logical next step on this road toward advancing decarbonization. At the same time, the climate impact of the BMW Group’s business model will also be drastically reduced. By 2035, each euro generated will see less than half as much CO2e emitted compared to 2019.\n\nThe key measures for achieving these results include the increasing use of renewable energies in production and the supply chain, the increased utilization of secondary raw materials, efficiency improvements in the use phase, as well as product and process innovations. The latter are being implemented across all drive variants as part of the BMW Group’s technology-neutral approach. In addition, an increasing proportion of the vehicle fleet will continue to be electrified.\n\nDecarbonization along the entire life cycle\n\nThe BMW Group has intentionally set itself the additional 2035 milestone to consistently advance its decarbonization strategy. Global customer demand for electric vehicles alone will not be sufficient to achieve the CO2e targets set for 2030 and 2035. The comprehensive approach to reducing CO2e emissions therefore spans the entire vehicle life cycle, irrespective of the drive variant.\n\nIn the supply chain, which is increasingly relevant in terms of CO2e emissions, especially for electric models, the company focuses on expanding the use of secondary raw materials and renewable energies. The specific priorities are highly CO2e-emitting components such as high-voltage batteries, aluminum, and steel. In addition, the company will be implementing product and process innovations, such as in the BMW Group’s sixth generation (Gen6) of battery technology.\n\nThe BMW Group also applies high standards in production: for example, since 2020, all electricity sourced from external suppliers for all plants worldwide has come exclusively from renewable sources. The BMW Group also works continuously on replacing fossil fuels. The new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, is the BMW Group’s first car factory to produce vehicles without any fossil fuels such as oil and gas in standard operation.\n\nTo lower CO2e emissions during the use phase, the BMW Group is implementing additional efficiency measures such as BMW EfficientDynamics, in addition to electrifying its vehicle fleet. As a result, efficiency potential in all vehicle subsystems, such as the drive system, tires, and aerodynamics, is consistently identified and implemented, regardless of the drive technology. The new BMW iX3, for instance, uses up to 20% less energy (WLTP combined) than its predecessor.\n\nReaching the new milestone will also depend on a variety of external factors, such as the transformation of the steel industry in favor of more CO2e-reduced steel, the expansion of the charging infrastructure, progress in the circular economy, and the advancement of battery cell technologies. This is why the BMW Group continues to pursue a number of strategic initiatives, such as the ongoing expansion of in-house expertise in state-of-the-art battery cell centers of excellence and innovative circular economy projects.\n\nSustainability in the iX3\n\nBattery Competence Center\n\nRecycling and Dismantling Centre\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n\nBMW Group, Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit\n\nTeamlead Sustainability Communication BMW Group\n\nTelefon: +49-151-601-53189\n\nInternet: www.press.bmwgroup.com/deutschland\n\nWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services. The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide; the company has a global sales network in more than 140 countries.\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe economic success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action. Sustainability is a key element of the BMW Group’s corporate strategy and covers all products from the supply chain and production to the end of their useful life."

      "content": "Munich. BMW M Motorsport relies on consistency for the line-ups of its two Hypercar programmes in the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA Series) in 2026. The same eight BMW M works drivers will take the wheel of the four BMW M Hybrid V8s as in 2025. However, there will be a change in the regular driver pairings in the IMSA Series.\n\nThe eight drivers for BMW M Motorsport’s works programmes in the FIA WEC and IMSA Series in 2026 are once again: Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI), René Rast (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER). As in the previous year, Vanthoor and van der Linde will undertake double duty as regular drivers in both race series. Eng and Wittmann will return for another full season in North America, where BMW M Team WRT will take over operations from BMW M Team RLL. Starting in 2026, the Belgian team will compete with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in both the FIA WEC and IMSA Series.\n\nIn FIA WEC, the driver line-ups for both cars remain unchanged. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8 will be shared by Magnussen, Marciello, and Vanthoor. In the #20 car, Frijns, Rast, and van der Linde will alternate. In the IMSA Series, there will be a swap in driver pairings. Regular drivers in the #24 BMW M Hybrid V8 will be Vanthoor and van der Linde. They will be supported in endurance races by Frijns and Rast. In the #25 car, Eng and Wittmann will contest the full season together. They will be joined by Magnussen and Marciello for endurance races.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Consistency was our priority when selecting the Hypercar drivers for the 2026 season. We are very satisfied with the performance of all eight drivers, and there is no reason to make major changes. With every race, our drivers gain more experience with the BMW M Hybrid V8, which is crucial for the continued progress of our programme. In 2026, we will race with an updated car and a new team in the IMSA Series. That’s enough change, so it was important for us to maintain continuity on the driver side. The key is that everyone works well as a team, pulls together, and advances our LMDh project. That’s exactly what’s happening. I’m very much looking forward to continuing this collaboration.”\n\nHypercar line-ups for 2026 at a glance:\n\nFIA WEC, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8: Kevin Magnussen (DEN)Raffaele Marciello (SUI)Dries Vanthoor (BEL)\n\nFIA WEC, #20 BMW M Hybrid V8: Robin Frijns (NED)René Rast (GER)Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)\n\nIMSA Series, #24 BMW M Hybrid V8: Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)Dries Vanthoor (BEL)Robin Frijns (NED), EnduranceRené Rast (GER), 24h Daytona\n\nIMSA Series, #25 BMW M Hybrid V8: Philipp Eng (AUT)Marco Wittmann (GER)Kevin Magnussen (DEN), EnduranceRaffaele Marciello (SUI), 24h Daytona"

The triad of world-class golf, sheer driving pleasure, and a dash of Bavarian zest in Germany since 1989 has been named the BMW International Open. The tournament has long been an institution on the DP World Tour; no other event has been collaborating with the same title partner without interruption for as long. The 37th edition of the BMW International Open will take place between 1st and 5th July 2026 (Golfclub München Eichenried). Three of Germany’s top players – Stephan Jäger, Matti Schmid and two-time Major winner Martin Kaymer – have already confirmed their participation, with further national and international stars set to follow. Tickets for what is currently the only German stop on the DP World Tour calendar are available from the official ticket shop, and you can take advantage of a ten percent Christmas discount until 24th December 2025: https://www.bmw-golfsport.com/en/content/tickets.html\n\nThe last time that Stephan Jäger teed off at his home club was in 2021. The 36-year-old has been living in the USA with his family for many years and has made a name for himself on the PGA TOUR. Jäger had intended to return to the place where he grew up and learned to play golf to take part in this year’s BMW International Open. However, a joyous occasion in July 2025 prevented him from returning home as Jäger’s second son entered the world. Now there is nothing stopping him from competing next summer. The winner of the 2024 Texas Children's Houston Open said: “I’m really looking forward to finally playing at Eichenried again and enjoying the BMW International Open. Having a tournament like this in your hometown is a rare and lucky coincidence. I can’t wait to enjoy this week with my family as well as old friends and colleagues in front of a German crowd.”\n\nTwo-time Major winner Martin Kaymer is another golfer not wanting to miss out on this experience, and he enjoys a special connection with the BMW International Open. The 40-year-old currently holds two tournament records: he is the only German winner and the youngest champion. Kaymer was 23 years and 177 days old when he won in Munich in 2008, but that is not the only reason that the event is one of his favourite tournaments. He said: “The people that you work alongside make a huge difference. You can tell that everyone at BMW is incredibly passionate about the tournament. Which makes it enjoyable for us as players, and I’m always grateful that we have a fantastic event like this here in Germany. Coming here is a source of great joy.”\n\nIt is this joy that Matti Schmid also associates with the BMW International Open. The Bavarian golfer, who predominantly plays on the PGA TOUR in the USA, has the iconic German tournament marked as a highlight on his calendar every year. As a child, the now 28-year-old watched the pros at Golfclub München Eichenried with great enthusiasm, and now the next generation of golfers are looking up to him: Schmid is currently the best-placed German golfer in the world rankings. At the 2025 BMW International Open he was the best home-grown player, finishing in joint seventh, and he cannot wait for the next edition: “The atmosphere was incredible throughout the week. I hope that everyone will be coming back because it’s great when we have a full house here.”\n\nThe Christmas promotional discount applies to day tickets and tournament tickets, as well as to Fairway Club tickets – excluding tickets that have already been discounted such as those for young people, students or people with disabilities. The ticket price includes a free shuttle bus service between Ismaning station and the golf club from Thursday to Sunday, and free car parking at the tournament site, subject to availability. There is no general admission fee for the Pro-Am tournament (Wednesday 1st July 2026). Children up to and including 14 years of age also enjoy free entry on all days.\n\nNew for the 2026 BMW International Open, an after-work ticket will be available for the Thursday or Friday. It will be valid as of 15:00 and can be purchased for half the cost of a day ticket. For information and prices, see the ticket shop at: https://www.bmw-golfsport.com/en/content/tickets.html"

The new season of the DP World Tour could not have got off to a more spectacular start. In the first round of the opening tournament, the BMW Australian PGA Championship at Royal Queensland Golf Club (Brisbane), spectators celebrated two aces. Daniel Gale, who pulled off the dream shot on the 11th hole (Par 3), was especially delighted. This is the hole on which the Hole-in-One prize is awarded: the new BMW M5 Touring, which launched in Australia this year. The BMW M5 Touring combines performance with characteristic design, while the plentiful space means it also impresses with its uncompromising suitability for everyday life. As a performance sports car with more than enough space for golf equipment, the BMW M5 Touring is the perfect hole-in-one car.\n\nGale, three-time winner of the Challenger PGA Tour of Australasia, aced the hole on the 154-metre 11th an 8 iron. After the round, the 29-year-old said that it was a predicted shot: “I played in the pro-am and I said, ‘this baby's mine’ – and it actually happened so it’s pretty crazy. In the air it was this perfect baby draw, riding the wind, and landed it perfectly and it trickled in at perfect speed as well.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kazuma Kobori sunk the first ace of the new season on the 17th hole. He might not have been rewarded with a hole-in-one car, but the shot helped the New Zealander enter the BMW PGA Australian Championship weekend in the lead. Gale is currently in tied for 18th place with Major winner and former world number one Adam Scott (AUS), and others.\n\nThis is the second edition for which BMW is title partner of the BMW PGA Australian Championship, the newest member of the family of BMW title tournaments on four continents. The other tournaments include the BMW PGA Championship in London (ENG), the BMW International Open in Munich (both on the DP World Tour), the penultimate playoff tournament on the PGA TOUR, the BMW Championship (USA), as well as the BMW Ladies Championship (LPGA Tour) in Korea. Once again a multitude of top players are competing at the BMW Australian PGA Championship in 2025, including BMW Australia’s golf ambassadors Min Woo Lee and Elvis Smylie. They both have brilliant memories of the tournament: Min Woo Lee won it in 2023, Elvis Smylie was victorious last year.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Touring: Energy consumption, weighted, combined: 2.0 l/100 km [141.2 mpg imp] and 30.7 kWh/ 100 km; CO2 emissions, weighted, combined: 46 g/ km; fuel consumption with discharged battery: 10.9 l/100 km [25.9 mpg imp] in the WLTP cycle; CO2 classes, weighted, combined: B, with discharged battery G."

      "content": "Milan/Munich. The BMW Art Car World Tour is set to arrive in Milan at the ADI Design Museum, marking a major milestone in the celebration of five decades of artistic innovation. From 4 December 2025 to 8 January 2026, visitors will have the opportunity to experience eight iconic BMW Art Cars designed by internationally renowned artists such as Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, and Jeff Koons. Having previously travelled to Art Basel Hong Kong, Le Mans Classic in France, the Bridge in USA, Louwman Museum in the Netherlands, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix and over 45 further stops in more than 30 countries across the globe, the BMW Art Car World Tour will conclude this year in Milan before continuing on to Rétromobile in Paris in 2026.\n\nMassimiliano Di Silvestre, President of BMW Italia says: “Celebrating 50 years of the BMW Art Cars is truly a privilege and a great emotion for us, as it allows us to express our commitment to the world of art and design, which finds the perfect setting in Italy. Having eight cars on display at the ADI Museum in Milan also means hosting the exhibition with the highest number of BMW Art Cars featured in the 2025 world anniversary tour — a strong sign of our commitment and our desire to convey the brand’s values to enthusiasts, customers, media and partners.”\n\nThe Italian leg of the Art Car World Tour kicked off at the Concorso d'Eleganza 2025, where the Sandro Chia Art Car was exhibited alongside the entire BMW Art Car miniature collection. On 29 and 30 November, the tour continues at the Nanni Nember “House of BMW Brescia”, where three legendary BMW Art Cars will be on display together with the new BMW iX3, the first model of the “Neue Klasse”. Located in the heart of Milan, a global capital of fashion and design, the ADI Design Museum will provide the perfect setting to showcase eight vehicles from the world-renowned collection to close the year:\n\nADI Design Museum The ADI Design Museum in Milan celebrates both Italian and international creativity and innovation. Since 2021, it has showcased award-winning works that have shaped the history of industrial design and aesthetics. Located in the heart of the city, the museum occupies a repurposed industrial space that harmoniously blends historical architecture with contemporary style, offering an ideal setting for exhibitions exploring the intersection of art, innovation, and culture.\n\nCelebrating 50 Years: The BMW Art Car Collection Milan takes its place on the global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enhanced by a vibrant array of events.\n\nThe BMW Art Car initiative was born in 1975 when French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, in collaboration with BMW’s then Head of Motorsport, Jochen Neerpasch, invited artist Alexander Calder to transform a car into a work of art. The result was a strikingly reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which not only became a visual masterpiece but also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, earning widespread acclaim. Over the years, the collection has grown to include contributions from legendary artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons and Julie Mehretu, each bringing their unique vision and style to the project.\n\nFollowing the 50th anniversary of the BMW Art Car Collection and the BMW 3 Series this year, car enthusiasts can look forward to another jubilee next year: 2026 will mark the 50th anniversary of Rétromobile, one of the world’s most prestigious automotive shows dedicated to the classic car sector. To celebrate this milestone, BMW is bringing together all BMW Art Cars that have raced at Le Mans for a spectacular reunion in Paris early next year. Find out more about this event here.\n\nShowcasing the collection of 20 iconic BMW Art Cars, the BMW Art Car World Tour serves as a testament to the company’s deep-rooted commitment to global cultural engagement – spanning more than a hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music, film and design.

The African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC) is set to arrive in Marrakech following the successful completion of its first workshops with African filmmakers and visual artists in Lagos, Tangier, and Nairobi. Continuing her BMW Art Car project, the AFMAC initiative was launched in April this year by internationally renowned artist Julie Mehretu, in collaboration with Emmy-nominated film producer Mehret Mandefro and BMW. As the long-term mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival (28 November – 6 December), Smeia, the exclusive importer of BMW in Morocco, together with BMW AG, will offer insights into works from AFMAC lead artists Zeresenay Berhane Mehari, Wanuri Kahiu, Jim Chuchu and The Otolith Group, as well as impressions from the workshops next to Mehretu’s BMW Art Car on the festival grounds during the opening weekend.\n\n10 years of partnership between Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, and Marrakech International Film Festival Established in 2001, the Marrakech International Film Festival aims to support and promote both the art of cinema and the film industry in Morocco. Smeia, the official BMW importer in Morocco, has been the mobility partner of the Marrakech International Film Festival for the past ten years enhancing each guest’s journey with elegance and distinction. Over the last two decades, the festival has evolved into a vibrant platform for creativity and exploration, celebrating the values of diversity, cultural exchange, and mutual enrichment.\n\nFor its 22nd edition the Marrakech International Film Festival celebrates world cinema with a selection of 82 films from 31 countries, presented in several sections: the Official Competition, Gala Screenings, Horizons section, the 11th Continent, Moroccan Panorama, Young Audiences and Families, and films screened in parallel with Tributes given to film personalities. The Official Competition showcases new talent in world cinema with 14 first and second feature films that compete for the Étoile d’or, awarded by a jury headed this year by South Korean director and multiple award winner Bong Joon-ho. Additionally, the festival will honour Jodie Foster, Guillermo del Toro, Raouya, and Hussein Fahmi – four exceptional figures whose careers showcase the diversity and richness of cinema. Highlights of this year's festival programme include screenings of film productions such as Dead Man’s Wire (opening film/ Gala) by Gus Van Sant and Akinola Davies Jr.'s My Father's Shadow (Official Competition). All details on this year’s official selection can be found here.\n\nSmeia, BMW and AFMAC are also collaborating with the festival’s Atlas Workshops, an industry and talent development programme. As part of this partnership, Mehret Mandefro and Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will share insights into their work with the Atlas Station participants on 30 November at 12noon. The panel “Beyond the Gaze: Authentic African Stories and the Creative Journey” explores the promise and perils of authentic storytelling as part of the creative process building AFMAC. Zeresenay Berhane Mehari will talk about his creative process and explore how to protect voice and vision in a global marketplace that often requires compromise.\n\nAFMAC at Marrakech International Film FestivalAt this year’s festival edition, Julie Mehretu's BMW Art Car #20 will be showcased on the festival grounds, surrounded by an AFMAC Hub. Julie Mehretu unveiled her BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car at the Centre Pompidou in 2024, marking the first time in the collection's history that an artist developed an Art Car that goes far beyond the car as a pure art object. In collaboration with BMW and Mehret Mandefro, Mehretu launched the African Film and Media Arts Collective (AFMAC), which has been hosting workshops in 2025 and 2026 across African cities such as Dakar, Lagos, and Cape Town. The initiative aims to nurture creativity and foster collaboration with emerging African artists and filmmakers.\n\n“The magic of bringing people together starts with us. AFMAC creates forums for conversations in small, critical masses and surfaces resources to take the next steps. We build on the work of our local cultural partners: They already created a grounded cultural infrastructure, showing that art is not just a nice-to-have but a must-have. The talent and cultural energy emerging from these cities is electric – culture cannot be gated, it will always find a way to be heard,“ says Mehret Mandefro, co-founder of AFMAC.\n\nThe outcomes of the AFMAC workshops will be exhibited alongside the 20th BMW Art Car at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town at the end of 2026. The presentation at the Marrakech International Film Festival offers a unique opportunity to gain first insights into the ongoing project ahead of the final exhibition. The display of Mehretu’s BMW M Hybrid V8 in Marrakech is part of the BMW Art Car World Tour, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary BMW Art Car Collection this year. To mark this jubilee, the tour features an exhibition programme spanning all five continents and including numerous accompanying events.\n\nThe AFMAC hub on the festival grounds in Marrakech is open to all visitors and located some meters away from the epicentre of the Film Festival Masterclasses, the Meydene theatre at M Avenue Marrakech. It offers an exclusive opportunity to explore selected works by leading artists, Wanuri Kahiu , The Otolith Group, and Zeresenay Berhane Mehari :\n\nJim Chuchu “Invocations: Release” (2015), a single-channel video work, portrays an African body navigating tradition, expectation, and self-determination, using ritualistic movement and visual metaphors to transform constraint into liberation.\n\n“Carrying Capacities” (2025) is a rhythmic visual meditation using aerial perspectives and editing to explore Earth's landscapes, cities, human activity, and environmental alteration, reflecting on the planet's ability to sustain human impact.\n\nWanuri Kahiu Through the trailer to the Sci-Fi short film “Pumzi” (2009) visitors encounter a futuristic Africa, 35 years after World War III ‘The Water War’. In a world where nature is extinct and the outside is dead, museum curator Asha defies the Maitu Council's restrictions to plant a germinating seedling outside, hoping to uncover signs of life.\n\nThe Otolith Group Inspired by the poet Rabindranath Tagore's 1921 lecture “The Message of the Forest” at Berlin's Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität—recorded on shellac at the Hotel Esplanade—the Otolith Group's eponymous work bridges nearly a century of time. The digitized recording of Tagore's voice, which envisioned the world campus he would establish that same year at Visva Bharati University in West Bengal, now speaks to ancient Banyan trees and today's students. Through separate paths of image and sound, the work connects the ancient past to the distant future of a changing planet.\n\nZeresenay Berhane MehariThrough the trailer to the feature film “Difret” visitors encounter the story of a young Ethiopian girl and a lawyer who challenge deeply-rooted cultural traditions to fight for equal rights. When 14-year-old Hirut is abducted for marriage and kills her captor in self-defense, lawyer Meaza steps in to save her from a death sentence, risking everything to confront one of Ethiopia’s oldest traditions.\n\nAfrican Film and Media Arts Collective – Past and future stationsApril 2025: Lagos, Nigeria, in partnership with Angels & MuseLead artist: Coco Fusco\n\nJuly 2025: Tangier, Morocco, in partnership with Cinematheque de TangerLead artist: Zeresenay Berhane Mehari\n\nOctober 2025: Nairobi, Kenya, in partnership with DocuboxLead artists: Jim Chuchu and Wanuri Kahiu\n\nDecember 2025: Dakar, Senegal, in partnership with Fanta Sy and Raw Material CompanyLead artist: Mati Diop\n\nJanuary 2026: Cape Town, South Africa, in partnership with Chimurenga Lead artist: The Otolith Group\n\n10 December 2026 – 15 August 2027: Final exhibition at Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art (Zeitz MOCAA), Cape Town, South Africa\n\nBiographies of the founders and lead artists Julie Mehretu is a world-renowned American artist, born in Addis Ababa in 1970.

      "content": "Sheer driving pleasure has always been baked into the BMW brand’s DNA. The BMW Z4 is a prime example: truly exhilarating roadster fun. Since the start of the first model generation in 2002, this open-top sports car has been wowing customers with its unique combination of peerless design, a purist driving experience and sporty dynamics. The upcoming BMW Z4 Final Edition provides fans with a time-limited opportunity to order a very special version of this vehicle – one that may well become a collectors’ item. It comes with specific equipment elements that create individual highlights on the outside as well as in the interior. At the same time, the Final Edition represents this iconic two‑seater’s crowning glory. Production of the BMW Z4 will come to an end in March 2026.\n\nCustomers will have a short order window for the BMW Z4 Final Edition, beginning in late January 2026.\n\nDistinctive looks for an unmistakeable personality.\n\nThe distinguishing exterior feature of the BMW Z4 Final Edition is its exclusive Frozen Matt Black paint finish. This colour, which underlines the model’s individual and dynamic flair, is only available for the Final Edition of the BMW Z4. It looks particularly impressive when combined with the M High-gloss Shadowline exterior trim, which is part of all Final Edition models. In addition to Frozen Matt Black, customers can select other colours from the BMW Z4 range, at no extra cost. The M Sport brake in High-gloss Red is also included with the BMW Z4 Final Edition. It impresses with particularly effective deceleration and attractive looks.\n\nRed accents in the interior.\n\nThe distinctive contrasting red seams selected especially for the Final Edition provide a literal common thread which, in this case, ties together the instrument panel, centre console, door trims and M Sport seats in Vernasca\n\nLeather/Alcantara. Another attractive eye-catcher is the M Alcantara steering wheel with contrasting seams to match. It accentuates the sporty character of the BMW Z4 Final Edition to perfection, while specially engraved door sill strips enhance its exclusivity.\n\nAvailable for all models.\n\nOffered for all models regardless of the transmission selected, the Final Edition trim level costs 4,200 euros. It requires the M Sport package already included as standard in the BMW Z4 sDrive30i and BMW Z4 M40i. With the BMW Z4 sDrive20i, the Final Edition is charged at 7,400 euros, as the M Sport package is not part of the standard equipment for this engine variant and is therefore added to the vehicle at the usual cost of 3,200 euros.\n\nThe history of the BMW Z4: Launch of the first generation in 2002.\n\nThe BMW Z4 is part of a long-standing BMW tradition of open-top two‑seater sports cars. This successful lineage includes icons such as the BMW 328 Roadster, the BMW 507 and the BMW Z8.\n\nThe BMW Z4 had its premiere in autumn 2002, as the direct successor to the BMW Z3 launched in 1995. And, like its predecessor, the BMW roadster known internally as the E85 series was produced at the BMW Plant Spartanburg in the US state of South Carolina.\n\nWith its long bonnet and short rear, the design of the BMW Z4 signalled power and sporting prowess. In the cabin, the low seating position just in front of the rear axle made for an unforgettable roadster driving experience. The BMW Z4 set new standards with a torsional stiffness previously unmatched in the convertible and roadster segment. Its supreme agility was also due to its 50/50 weight distribution. The BMW Z4 M Roadster was the first generation’s range-topper. Fitted with the 252 kW/340 hp six-cylinder in-line engine from the BMW M3, it accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.0 seconds.\n\nThe second BMW Z4 generation: Unchanged dynamic appeal, electro-hydraulic retractable hardtop as standard.\n\nIn December 2008 BMW introduced the second generation of the Z4 to the world. The new two-seater known internally as the E89 model series again combined classic proportions with leading-edge engineering.\n\nIt came with a completely new, electro-hydraulically retractable hardtop made up of two roof sections. Featuring an aluminium shell design, the hardtop was included as standard and could be opened or closed at the touch of a button in just 20 seconds. With the hardtop in place, the BMW Z4 offered the refined comfort of a sporty premium coupé. The interior of the new BMW Z4 had gained much over the first-generation model in terms of headroom and elbow room. In addition, this marked the first time the roadster used the BMW iDrive infotainment system.\n\nThe third-generation BMW Z4: Modern interpretation of the classic open-top sports car.\n\nBMW premiered the third – and current – generation of the BMW Z4 in August 2018 at Pebble Beach Golf Links near Monterey, California. The BMW Z4 world premiere revealed a modern interpretation of the classic open-top sports car. A premium roadster boasting an electrically operated fabric softtop, sporty handling and a purist, driver-focused interior design. This was complemented by premium-quality driver assistance, infotainment and connectivity features. Unparalleled in this segment is the three-litre straight-six engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology in the BMW Z4 M40i, which has been offered with a manual transmission since 2024 as the Pure Impulse Edition. The Final Edition will be the pinnacle of the third-generation BMW Z4.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW Z4 sDrive20i (WLTP combined (EnVKV): fuel consumption 7.4–7.3 litres/100 km; CO2 emissions: 166–164 g/km, CO2 class F) BMW Z4 sDrive30i (WLTP combined (EnVKV): fuel consumption 7.4 litres/100 km; CO2 emissions: 167 g/km, CO2 class F) BMW Z4 M40i (WLTP combined (EnVKV): fuel consumption 8.7–8.0 litres/100 km; CO2 emissions: 197–181 g/km, CO2 class G) * Consumption and emissions data:The figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, energy consumption and range are for vehicles as offered on the German market. All data are based on the WLTP test cycle. Energy consumption and emissions data refer to the German Passenger Car Energy Labelling Regulation (EnVKV)."

      "content": "Our initiatives in collaboration with cities include mobility research and piloting solutions, making driving and traffic more efficient, while reducing congestion. Mobility behavior is an important aspect for cities, especially regarding driving and parking vehicles in urban areas. That is why we research how to make the mobility behavior of our customers more city-friendly, tailored to their individual needs. Through strategic collaborations, such as with the city of Rotterdam, both parties gain deep insights into what the city needs, and which solutions work well with drivers. Our research shows that mobility behavior can be effectively influenced by nudging, or in other words, the positive motivation of people.\n\nThrough attractive digital experiences, we aim to enhance the driving experience and encourage our customers to use their vehicles more efficiently. Recently, three pilots based on relatively small but positive incentives have been completed. The insights from these are promising.\n\nThe research project named “My Travels”, conducted throughout the Netherlands in the second half of 2024 with BMW models, provided a report to users about the length of their trips made and offered information on realistic alternatives such as travel by foot, bicycle, or public transport. The results showed that simply gaining insight into one's own travel behavior, including information on the length of trips and alternative travel options, provides incentives to choose an alternative mode of transport instead of the car. This result aligns perfectly with Rotterdam's goal to free up roads for those who truly need to use them.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented a pilot with a gamification approach to reduce the footprint of our products in the use phase. Real world data from a representative BMW and MINI fully electric fleet show that driving in the efficient driving mode generally results in an average energy consumption reduction of about 7%. The “MINI Artwork Challenge” pilot’s aim was to stimulate drivers to switch to this mode. It was conducted in the first quarter of this year in the latest generation fully electric MINI models Countryman and Cooper, exploring whether gamification can encourage more energy-efficient driving behavior. In this pilot, the virtual artwork – an AI generated image — grew larger the more the user drove in the efficient driving mode. The pilot results show this encouraged participants to increase their share of trips in the efficient driving mode by 60% compared to the baseline phase.\n\nIn total, 355 drivers of electric and plug-in hybrid BMW models participated in this project, which brought at least two valuable results. Gamification increased CO₂-improved EV charging by 6% and it suggests that even participants who are already environmentally conscious are still willing to take additional steps to reduce their CO2 impact by charging their vehicles CO2 improved.\n\nThe city of Rotterdam and BMW Group will use the insights gained to develop more sustainable, user-oriented mobility concepts that improve both individual mobility and the urban mobility ecosystem.\n\nThis research project originated from a bachelor thesis supervised by the University of Münster. Erasmus University Rotterdam was involved as the regular research partner of BMW Netherlands in the design and analysis of the feedback survey.\n\nThree hundred participants, drivers of BMW and MINI models across the country, were provided with a test app that offered a clear view of travel habits, at a more detailed level than the “My Trips” feature already known to BMW and MINI customers from the My BMW and MINI app.\n\nThe app contains two elements: Distances and Alternatives. The first offered the driver transparency of their car trips. A pie chart allowed app users to see at a glance how many trips they made weekly of up to 1 kilometer, 1-5 kilometers, and 5 kilometers or more. Alternatives provided insight into which realistic alternatives would have been possible for specific trips: by foot, bicycle, or public transport, including any distance and/or time savings.\n\nThe research question was: do active app users reduce more trips based on the travel report and recommendations for alternative modes of transport than inactive users?\n\nOverall, analysis indicated that active users of the app reduced one car trip weekly compared to participants who did not use the app. This means that simply gaining insight into one's own travel behavior and information on alternative travel options provides incentives to leave the car unused once a week, potentially reducing traffic congestion in the city.\n\nZooming in on weekly trips, the reduction in car usage was even slightly larger: active users made an average of 1.5 fewer trips (of up to five kilometers). In other words, more than one short trip was avoided. No significant decrease in car usage was seen on weekends.\n\nFactors influencing participants' choices related to timing (weekday or weekend), weather conditions, and personal situation (with or without children). This emerged from the comprehensive survey that was part of the research. When asked which types of trips participants were most inclined to swap for alternative transport, the top three were: 1) to a park, restaurant, etc., 2) to the gym, 3) to the supermarket. Picking up and dropping off children remains preferred by car, as indicated by the last place in the ranking.\n\nWhen asked about the three main reasons to leave the car unused, the top three were: 1) travel duration, 2) convenience and availability of alternative modes of transport, 3) weather conditions.\n\n130 participants took part in the pilot. These drivers were rewarded for using the efficient driving mode of their MINIs. The more frequently this mode was used, the further an AI-generated artwork (consisting of stylized plants or animals) evolved. The image was then displayed on the central screen at the start of each trip.\n\nReal world data from a representative BMW and MINI fully electric fleet show that driving in the efficient driving mode generally results in an average energy consumption reduction of about 7%. The “MINI Artwork Challenge” encouraged participants to increase their share of trips in the efficient driving mode to almost 40%, compared to 25% in the baseline phase. This corresponds to a 60% increase in trips in the efficient driving mode.\n\nThe research question was: how can nudges effectively influence the timing of electric vehicle charging to align with periods in which the use of renewable energy sources is higher?\n\nA total of 13.153 charging sessions were analyzed, and timeslots with a cleaner energy mix were identified on 67 out of 87 days. Through gamification, we successfully encouraged participants to shift their charging sessions to time slots with a forecasted higher share of renewables in the Dutch energy mix, achieving a 6% increase in such charging sessions compared to the control group. In contrast, providing forecasts and statistics alone had no significant effect. Plug-in hybrid drivers were less likely to change their charging behavior. Customers expressed three things:\n\nIn 2022, Rotterdam and BMW launched the Smart City Travel pilot. This project focused on motorists who (regularly) drove from outside toward the inner city of Rotterdam. BMW Group, Rotterdam, and the Erasmus University Rotterdam investigated ways to entice motorists to park their cars at a park-and-ride (P+R) on the outskirts of the city and continue the last mile of their journeys using public or shared transport. The question was: what is needed to motivate BMW drivers to make this choice in advance and then actually switch modes when an alternative mode is actively offered in the navigation?\n\nResults showed that information about alternative transport should not only arrive in the car after the trip starts, as people are not prepared for it or, for practical reasons (no coat, too many belongings), cannot or do not want to switch. This led to the idea of focusing more on transparency and providing drivers with insight into their trips and offering alternatives as desired (before or after a trip) in an app.\n\nA safe, healthy, and livable city is high on the agenda of the Rotterdam municipality. This requires a new vision of future mobility, where sustainability, traffic safety, accessibility, and flow play a crucial role. Since 2018, BMW Group and the City of Rotterdam have been working together to realize these shared ambitions and pilot mobility solutions around integrating the car into the ecosystem of a livable city."

      "content": "Leipzig. As BMW Group Plant Leipzig celebrates its 20th anniversary, a stream of high-ranking representatives from politics, business and civil society today came to the plant to offer their congratulations on its two-decade success story. Among them were Barbara Meyer, Secretary of State for the Free State of Saxony, and the Lord Mayor of Leipzig Burkhard Jung. Both highlighted the plant’s importance for the economic development of the Leipzig/Halle region, but also for Saxony more generally. Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production, emphasised Leipzig’s pioneering spirit and extreme flexibility as factors in its success.\n\nSince 2005 Plant Leipzig has produced almost 4,000,000 vehicles and received over €5.6 billion so far in investment from the BMW Group, creating 6,680 jobs with BMW.

      "content": "“We offer our customers the ability to choose from a full range of exciting products across all segments, with all types of powertrains. The prestigious ‘Golden Steering Wheel’ and ‘Auto Trophy’ awards are a clear validation of our strategy, our products and the appeal of our brands,” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “Since its world premiere in September, the BMW iX3 has been a sensation: pre-orders are even exceeding our high expectations, demonstrating an extraordinary level of customer interest. The fact that the BMW iX3 has now won two of Germany’s most prestigious automotive awards, even before its official market launch, underscores the pioneering role and the uniqueness of the BMW iX3.”\n\n“Golden Steering Wheel” – 49 years of honouring the most significant new vehicle models. The “Golden Steering Wheel” is awarded by German “Auto Bild” car magazine and German weekly newspaper “Bild am Sonntag”, both published by Axel Springer SE. It counts among the most prestigious accolades of the European automotive industry. First presented in 1976, these annual awards honour outstanding new vehicles released on the German market. The nominations for the 49th iteration of the event comprised 72 new models from 2025. Based on readers’ votes, three models in each vehicle class progressed to the finals at the German DEKRA-Lausitzring race track. Here, the top competitors faced a jury of race car drivers, industry experts and motor journalists from “Auto Bild” and “Bild am Sonntag”. Following comprehensive tests, the jurors awarded points ranking the vehicles’ everyday usability, quality, sustainability, powertrains and driving characteristics. Value for money and efficiency also formed part of the assessment.\n\nMotor journalists award BMW iX3 “Golden Steering Wheel” as “Best Innovation”.\n\nThe 2025 IAA Mobility show in Munich saw the world premiere of the new battery-electric BMW iX3 – the first Neue Klasse vehicle. The new BMW iX3 establishes a new design language and sets standards for driving dynamics and performance. A range of up to 805 kilometres, battery charging at up to 400 kW and a consumption of just 15.1 kWh/100 km (WLTP) demonstrate the outstanding abilities of the new BMW iX3. Other highlights include the BMW Panoramic iDrive, which combines four central elements into one powerful unit. With the high-performance Heart of Joy central computer and BMW Dynamic Performance Control, the new BMW iX3 takes driving pleasure to an unprecedented level. That was also the motor journalists’ assessment as they awarded the BMW iX3 the “Golden Steering Wheel” for “Best Innovation”, thus adding to the large BMW trophy collection. Since 2019, at least one of the coveted awards has gone to Munich every year.\n\nTop score and class win for BMW M5 Touring.\n\nThe BMW M5 Touring won the “Golden Steering Wheel” in the “Upper/Luxury Class”. The performance car’s third generation features a new M Hybrid powertrain that combines an exhilarating V8 engine with a BMW eDrive motor integrated into the transmission, for a system output of 535 kW/727 hp. With its versatile luggage capacity of 500 to 1,630 litres, the BMW M5 Touring offers even more everyday usability than a sedan – an advantage that was not lost on the jury. They also rated the performance model ahead of the other finalists in its class in all driving disciplines, as well as in terms of value for money and consumption. Overall, the BMW M5 Touring scored a higher points total than any other vehicle – of any class – in this year’s “Golden Steering Wheel” contest.\n\n“Auto Trophy”: renowned award, historic success.\n\nGerman car magazine “Auto Zeitung” has presented its “Auto Trophy” awards since 1987, making this one of the German automotive industry’s most established awards events. In 2025, there were around 400 models/brands in 18 classes to choose from, reflecting the wide range of vehicles available on the German market. Between 10 September and 21 October 2025, a total of 9,872 readers took part in the poll, registering their votes online or sending in ballot papers by mail. In the end, the magazine’s readers awarded BMW and its vehicles a total of nine “Auto Trophies”. Never before has a manufacturer been so successful in this established readers’ poll. The result even surpasses the brand’s very good achievement in 2024, when BMW garnered eight first places, and confirms that readers hold the current BMW model portfolio in very high esteem.\n\nThese are the classes where BMW models or the BMW brand came out on top:\n\n“Best Small Cars, City Cars & Compacts”: BMW 1 Series (15.7%)*.\n\n“Best Medium Class”: BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé (19.4%)*.\n\n“Best Upper/Luxury Class”: BMW 5 Series (25.4%)*.\n\n“Best SUV between 30,000 and 60,000 euros”: BMW X3 (19.7%)*.\n\n“Best SUV above 60,000 euros”: BMW X5 (14.1%)*.\n\n“Best Electric Sedan”: BMW i5 (20.5%)*.\n\n“Best Electric SUV under 50,000 euros”: BMW iX1 (18.3%)*.\n\n“Best Electric SUV above 50,000 euros”: BMW iX3 (17.9%)*.\n\n“World’s Best Brand”: BMW (22.1%)*.\n\n* Share of votes cast.\n\n** Consumption and emissions data:\n\n1 For plug-in hybrids: weighted, combined (EC AC charge weighted).\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: The BMW iX3 (BMW iX3 50 xDrive: energy consumption, combined: 17.9–15.1 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions, combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); electric range: 679–805 km (WLTP); CO2 class(es): A)** BMW M5 Touring (energy consumption, weighted, combined: 18.1–17.6 kWh/100 km and 5.3–5.0 l/100 km (WLTP); CO2 emissions, weighted, combined: 119–114 g/km (WLTP); CO2 classes: with discharged battery G, weighted, combined D–C; fuel consumption with discharged battery: 10.9–10.7 l/100 km (WLTP))** ,1"

Jordan Pepper (RSA) will become a BMW M works driver and will compete in races next year in the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The 29-year-old is the third South African driver in the line-up, following Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde. Details about his racing programme will be announced at a later date .\n\nPepper boasts numerous successes in GT racing. In 2025, he triumphed at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) and fought for the DTM title until the final race in his first full season. In the GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup, he finished second in the drivers’ standings, just behind the Team WRT duo of Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts (BEL). He achieved the same result in the Endurance Cup in 2024. Further big successes to date include winning the GTD-PRO class at the IMSA finale Petit Le Mans in 2024, victory at the Bathurst 12 Hour in 2020, and becoming the GT World Challenge America champion in 2021. In 2014, he won the overall title in the Volkswagen Scirocco R Cup Germany.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “In the coming season, we will once again undertake a very extensive racing programme with our BMW M4 GT3 EVO. Our goal is always to compete at the highest level in the best GT racing series in the world and fight for victories and titles. To achieve this, we need a driver line-up that is both large and of the highest quality. Jordan Pepper fits our requirements perfectly. Over the years, he has established himself as one of the top GT3 drivers. His performances, especially in the past two seasons, have been impressive. I am very pleased to welcome him to the BMW M Motorsport family and look forward to many shared successes in the future.”\n\nJordan Pepper: “It’s very exciting to begin a new chapter of my career with BMW M Motorsport. In South Africa, BMW is a very prestigious brand that I grew up with and always admired. My path into professional racing in Europe, however, took me through other manufacturers. Now I have the opportunity to drive for BMW M Motorsport, and I’m extremely excited about it. Over the years, I’ve seen how strong they are as competitors, and now I’m looking forward to driving the BMW M4 GT3 EVO for the first time. I know that adapting to a new car is always a challenge, and I’ll need to get used to the car over the winter but I generally like this type of car, as I’ve spent much of my career in similar cars. I can’t wait to work with all the great drivers at BMW M Motorsport – including, of course, Sheldon and Kelvin van der Linde. We’ve known each other since we were kids and are good friends. We’ve always dreamed of winning races together. Now we’re with the same manufacturer, and hopefully, we’ll get the chance to make that dream come true someday.”"

      "content": "Macau. BMW M Motorsport celebrated another success at the FIA GT World Cup in the narrow street canyons of Macau (CHN): Raffaele Marciello (SUI) claimed second place on the podium in the #53 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of ROWE Racing. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) delivered a strong comeback drive in the Team WRT #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, sporting its special Shell livery. His charge brought him up to sixth place in Sunday’s main race. The FIA GT World Cup, held as part of the legendary Macau Grand Prix on the Guia Circuit, traditionally marks the spectacular finale of the GT3 racing season.\n\nAfter Friday’s qualifying session came the 12-lap qualification race on Saturday, followed by the 16-lap main race on Sunday. Marciello secured fifth place in qualifying. Van der Linde was unlucky as after making contact with the track barrier he was unable to set a timed lap and had to start the qualification race from the back of the grid. In Saturday’s sprint race, which determined the starting positions for Sunday, both BMW M4 GT3 EVOs moved forward. Marciello finished fourth, while van der Linde improved to 13th and was then promoted to 12th after a competitor received a penalty.\n\nIn the main race, Marciello seized his chance immediately at the start and sprinted up to second place – a podium position he held until the finish line. Van der Linde gained several positions in the turbulent opening stage and later executed a brilliant overtaking manoeuvre on the tight street circuit to take sixth place. The winner of the main race was Antonio Fuoco (ITA / Ferrari), who had already taken pole position and won the qualification race.\n\nReactions after FIA GT World Cup in Macau:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The second place in Macau this year was a great performance by Raffaele. Gaining positions right at the start was the key to the podium after starting from fourth. Congratulations to Ferrari; I think we were simply missing the pace to keep up with Antonio Fuoco. Given that, we are happy with second place. For Sheldon, it was unfortunate that he couldn’t set a time in Friday’s qualifying. We all know that qualifying is crucial here on this narrow street circuit in Macau. Nevertheless, he gave a great performance and worked his way from the very back to sixth place in the main race over the course of the weekend. Many thanks to ROWE Racing, to Team WRT, and to everyone at BMW M Motorsport. Now we wrap up the season and focus fully on the new year.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (ROWE Racing, #53 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 2nd place main race, 4th place qualification race ): “Our qualifying was not the best, for sure. When you start from fifth it’s always difficult to fight your way to the front. But we had a good first sector and in the main race, there was the opportunity to overtake at the start. But in the end we also need to admit that the Ferrari was too quick. I tried my best and second place was the maximum I could do today.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 6th place main race, 12th place qualification race ): “Unfortunately it has not been the weekend we came here for. We obviously wanted to try to win the race, that was my main goal coming into the weekend. But it started off on the wrong foot in qualifying with a mistake that I take responsibility for. We had to start at the back of the field in the qualifying race, had a very good start but then unfortunately got spun around in turn three. So that was another rollercoaster we had to go through. But in the main race, we gained a lot of places at the start and I was able to capitalise on others making mistakes. So, yes, we are happy with the end, even if it didn’t start how we wanted it to. But from P16 to P6: we would have signed that before the race.”"

He dominated the season and clinched the world championship title early, already in Japan at the 17th of 22 rounds. In the BMW M Award standings, Márquez collected so many points – with eight pole positions and five additional front-row starts – that he could no longer be caught, even though he missed the final four rounds of the season due to injury. Márquez won the 2025 BMW M Award with 351 points, finishing eight points ahead of his brother Álex Márquez in second place. As in the races, MotoGP™ riders receive points for the BMW M Award according to their qualifying positions. The winner at the end of the season is awarded an exclusive high-performance automobile from BMW M. This coveted award has been presented every year since 2003.\n\nCarmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna Sports, said: “Congratulations to Marc Márquez. He has made an impressive comeback this season and once again demonstrated why he is one of the greatest MotoGP riders of all time. From 2013 onwards, we handed him the keys to a new BMW M car seven times in a row at the season finale – and I am delighted that we can do so again this year. His performance and talent have been outstanding, and he truly deserves the BMW M Award this season. At the same time, my thanks go to BMW M GmbH. For 22 years now, the BMW M Award has been an integral part of MotoGP, making it a genuine tradition. It’s a special recognition of what our riders and their teams achieve weekend after weekend in qualifying.”\n\nAxel Mittler added: “What Marc Márquez has shown this season was simply incredible. Congratulations to our record winner: seven consecutive victories were already historic, but his eighth BMW M Award triumph is truly remarkable, especially considering that he built such a big lead in the standings that even his injury couldn’t stop him from winning. We are delighted to add our new BMW M2 CS to Marc’s collection of BMW M Award winners’ cars. This high-performance sports car once again raises the benchmark in its segment, and with its pure performance, dynamics, and agility, it’s the perfect winner’s car for the currently world’s best MotoGP rider. We wish Marc lots of fun with his prize – and a smooth recovery, so that he can thrill us again next season!”\n\nMarc Márquez said: “It took a few years, but I’m really happy to see my name back on the list of BMW M Award winners. This season has been a dream for me, even though I obviously didn’t imagine it ending with a shoulder injury that made me miss the final races. But it’s great to be here in Valencia and to be recognized once again as the fastest qualifier – for the eighth time! I actually found out I’d won while I was out buying fruit – my brother Álex didn’t manage the result he needed in the penultimate qualifying in Portimão to keep the contest open. But I promised him he’ll get to drive the car too! For us, it’s always something special when our performances on the track are recognized in this way. Now it’s time for the winter break, and my goal for 2026 is clear: to win the world championship, and this award, again!”\n\nThe 2025 winner’s car, the BMW M2 CS, is the latest exclusive special model from BMW M GmbH in the premium compact high-performance sports car segment. It impresses with outstanding agility, significantly increased performance, exceptional driving dynamics, and particularly sporty design features. The straight-six engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and high-revving characteristics delivers an impressive 390 kW/530 hp. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels via the standard 8-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic. The BMW M2 CS accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds. Thanks to the extensive use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) components in both the exterior and interior, the BMW M2 CS is also the lightest M2 of the current generation.\n\nAs part of its extensive activities as the “Official Car of MotoGP™”, BMW M GmbH presents the BMW M Award at the end of each season to the best qualifier. Before Márquez extended his record in 2025 with his eighth victory, Francesco Bagnaia had won the coveted award for the past three years. The list of winners since the award’s introduction in 2003 also includes Valentino Rossi, Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo, Fabio Quartararo, Sete Gibernau and Nicky Hayden.\n\nFor more information on BMW M GmbH, its partnership with MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports since 1999, and the involvement as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’ see: www.bmw-m.com\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M2 CS: Combined fuel consumption: 10.0 l/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 226 g/km according to WLTP, CO₂ class: G."

      "content": "Macau. The BMW road racers once again proved unbeatable on the spectacular Guia Circuit in Macau. At the 57th edition of the legendary Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, they secured a 1-2-3 finish, resulting in an all-BMW podium. The dominant rider of the race weekend was Davey Todd (GBR) on the #8 BMW M 1000 RR of Zeeco BMW Motorrad; after topping both practice and qualifying, the Briton rode to victory through the narrow urban canyons. His teammate Peter Hickman (GBR) and Erno Kostamo (FIN / Racing for Inclusion by RVS) completed the BMW success by finishing second and third.\n\nIt was the second time Todd lifted the coveted Macau winner’s trophy. He also stood on the top step of the podium last year. However, that time the actual race could not be held due to rain, and the trophies were awarded to the three fastest riders in qualifying: BMW racers Todd, Kostamo, and Hickman. This year, the weather again caused delays in the motorcycle schedule and qualifying had to be moved from Friday to Saturday, but the 12-lap race started as planned. Todd dominated from pole position and crossed the finish line with a ten-second lead.\n\nHickman, who has already won the Macau Grand Prix four times with BMW, made a strong comeback from injury by taking second place. Kostamo, the 2022 winner and last year’s runner-up, was also among the favourites. Starting from second on the grid, he held the position in the opening laps, but a small mistake allowed Hickman to pass. In the end, Kostamo secured an unchallenged third place.\n\nA total of six BMW M 1000 RR machines finished within the top ten. Italian Macau newcomer Maurizio Bottalico (Croweperformance / Bottalico) also drew attention by finishing sixth in his debut on the Guia Circuit. Davo Johnson (AUS / Racing for Inclusion by RVS) came home seventh, and Phillip Crowe (GBR / Croweperformance / Bottalico) finished in tenth place.\n\nReactions after the Macau Grand Prix.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “Congratulations to Davey Todd, Peter Hickman, Erno Kostamo and everyone involved on this outstanding end to the season. It has not been an easy year for the 8Ten Racing team – in particular Peter’s severe injury presented the team with major challenges. All the more impressive, then, to see Davey’s and Peter’s squad competing under the Zeeco BMW Motorrad banner, as well as Erno with Racing for Inclusion by RVS, standing together on the podium here in Macau. We are incredibly proud of the riders and teams, wish them a well-deserved celebration in Macau, and look forward to a shared 2026 season. The many top-10 finishes by the BMW riders in Macau underline the exceptional performance of our M 1000 RR, which once again demonstrated its strengths on the demanding Guia Circuit.”\n\nDavey Todd, Zeeco BMW Motorrad: “I was joking with Pete saying that I now have one and a half Macau wins. It’s awesome to do that and to prove everybody wrong after saying that last year’s win wasn’t a proper one. I had a point to prove coming here tis year. I was really excited, we had a great pace, the whole Zeeco BMW Motorrad team has done an amazing job. I’ve been feeling awesome on the BWM M 1000 RR all week. I am just a little bit disappointed about one thing. I thought that the pace was quite slow in the race, I didn’t push too hard when I had a gap, and then I found out that we did 23s, and I am sure that a new lap record with 22s would have been possible so I’m looking forward to being back here next year to see what else we can do. There are so many sponsors and partners who have helped us to even get out here to Macau. We really appreciate all of them and want to say thank you.”\n\nPeter Hickman, Zeeco BMW Motorrad: “It has been a pretty good race. I am very content that I showed that I still have the pace. I was only a couple of tenths off Davey. I am sure he had more in the bag still but to be able to be close in the position I am in at the moment personally makes me really, really happy. It was great to show that I have the pace, I just need to work on myself now over winter to get ready for the 2026 season. A massive thank you to Zeeco BMW Motorrad, all the boys and girls and everyone that helped us and made sure that we got here. It has been absolutely fantastic. A 1-2 for our team – it couldn’t get better!”\n\nErno Kostamo, Racing for Inclusion by RVS: “I was struggling in Free Practice and had many problems with the bike but then in qualifying all went well. In the race I was a little bit nervous. I was pushing hard behind Peter and Davey. This year’s Macau Grand Prix was not so easy for me but I am happy.”\n\nAir temperature: 23°, humidity: 80%, conditions: dry.\n\nRacing for Inclusion by RVS\n\nJackson Racing powered by Proposer2\n\nRacing for Inclusion by RVS\n\nCroweperformance / Bottalico\n\nMaurizio Bottalico (ITA)\n\nCroweperformance / Bottalico\n\nMichael Sweeney (IRL)\n\nLaurent Hoffmann (BEL)\n\nHoffmann and LM by MRP\n\nAir temperature: 23°, humidity: 82%, conditions: dry, laps: 12.\n\nRacing for Inclusion by RVS\n\nHoffmann and LM by MRP\n\nMaurizio Bottalico (ITA)\n\nCroweperformance / Bottalico\n\nRacing for Inclusion by RVS\n\nCroweperformance / Bottalico\n\nLaurent Hoffmann (BEL)\n\nHoffmann and LM by MRP\n\nMichael Sweeney (IRL)\n\nFastest race lap: Davey Todd, lap 7, 2:23.702"

      "content": "Munich/ Island. For nature lovers, Iceland, is a true dream destination - and the easiest way to explore it is by car. Even though much has changed in the land of geysers, volcanoes, glaciers and endless mountain ranges, Iceland is always good for an adventure or two - and so is the MINI Countryman SE ALL4.There are just under 2,700 kilometres as the crow flies between Munich and Reykjavik in the south of Iceland - and a few more to the Westfjords. By road, it is around 2,300 kilometres plus a two-day ferry crossing from Hirtshals in Denmark to Sedisfjödur.\n\nThe MINI Countryman SE ALL4 is off-road ready. Apart from the road network in the capital Reykjavik, there is hardly much more tarmac than the Ring Road, which is the easiest way to explore the island. The MINI Countryman SE ALL4 is therefore more rugged than the family SUV is normally known for when it leaves Munich: off-road tyres, luggage rack with spare wheel on the roof, sand plates, spade and jack are all part of the sensible equipment package if you want to experience sights such as waterfalls, geysers and fjords.\n\nTwo electric motors for powerful all-wheel drive. With its electric range of up to 432 kilometres according to the WLTP test cycle, the powerful MINI Countryman sets off on the first leg of its journey, which takes it via Hamburg to Denmark to the port of Hirtshals. The off-road tyres specially suited to the challenges of the island and the extensive roof structure hardly reduce the range of the MINI Countryman SE ALL4. With a maximum charging capacity of 130 kW, less than 30 minutes remain for route preparation during stopovers. On the way along German motorways, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 initially demonstrates its touring qualities: Two electric motors with a total output of 230 kW/313 hp and a torque of 494 Nm provide a powerful drive. The Driving Assistant Professional enables semi-automated driving for relaxed journeys and arrivals. Additional space in the redesigned interior gives the driver and front passenger more room in the shoulder and elbow area.\n\nRough North Sea and long days in Iceland. During the ferry crossing from Hirtshals in Denmark to Sedisfjödur in Iceland, the North Sea is unusually rough with a considerable storm and waves of over eight metres. The weather on arrival in Iceland is worse than expected: light snowfall, low clouds and temperatures below freezing. However, after the start of the stage on the way inland, the already impressive landscapes of lava rock become increasingly worth seeing. The never-ending midsummer sun wins the battle against the night - and so the Countryman reaches the hotel shortly after midnight in bright sunshine after a long first stage on Iceland's mainland.\n\nMINI Countryman: Charisma defies mud and dust. Early the next morning, at around five o'clock, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4, which has long since been heavily soiled, sets off on the challenging final stage of Route 622 - one of the most demanding and dangerous tracks in the Westfjords with a particularly spectacular scree passage by the water, which can only be driven through at low tide.With its ‘Blazing Blue’ paintwork, bronze-coloured elements thanks to the Favoured Trim, all terrain tyres and roof rack, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 causes quite a stir and is a real talking point on the road. Dust and mud on the rough routes cannot diminish its radiance along the journey.\n\nRelaxed and electric on Iceland's rugged coastline. The all-electric MINI Countryman masters green meadows, gloomy scree or narrow paths with cliff overhangs and water crossings with ease. A gentle off-road pace hardly reduces the electric range. Here and there it touches down, scraping the turf, while the views of the sea and the steeply sloping coastline become increasingly spectacular. The MINI Countryman is tenacious, confident and fully electric as it battles its way along the narrow and challenging Route 622, the conditions of which have been made even more difficult by the rainfall of recent weeks.\n\nThe MINI Countryman knows adventure. Coming from the south, nothing works just before the beach section of Route 622: where waves and weather have torn everything away, the notorious track is no longer passable by any vehicle. Even spades, sand trays and jacks can't help. And yet, between Munich and Iceland, the MINI Countryman SE ALL4 proves that it rightly bears its name - even fully electrically.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Countryman SE ALL4 (electricity consumption combined: 18.5 - 16.8 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 399 - 432)."

      "content": "The BMW Museum in Munich takes its visitors on an impressive journey through more than 100 years of car and motorcycle history shaped by wonderment, innovation, dynamism and the joy of the open road on two wheels and four. It charts a course from the early days to the present day, and in so doing paints a comprehensive picture of the BMW brand’s talent for innovation. Good news about the Museum has travelled fast: with over 840,000 visitors in the past year, it is one of Munich’s most popular. The BMW Museum is part of BMW Group Classic – the wing of the company charged with nurturing the history of BMW and everything that involves.\n\nHistory and Architecture.\n\nBMW has always demonstrated a keen awareness of its history. A factory museum was opened at the Munich plant back in 1966, and in the late 1960s the BMW Board of Management decided to build a museum to reflect the company as a whole. Viennese architect Karl Schwanzer won the competition to design the building, and the Museum was duly created according to his plans. His was the inspiration behind the Rotunda, also known informally as the “Bowl” on account of its distinctive appearance. The Museum concept was presented in 1973 under the heading “Streets and urban squares in the renovated exhibition space”. A central ramp within the Rotunda connects a system of apparently floating platforms.\n\nDesign firm Atelier Brückner took the concept to the next stage with the renovation and expansion of the Museum from 2004 to 2008, since when the low-rise section of the building has been part of the overall complex together with the “Bowl”. “Bridges and houses” have been added to the architectural concept, which has expanded the surface area of the Museum to five times its original size. A system of ramps shapes the inner structure of the Museum. It reaches dynamically into the space and appears to be almost weightless. The modern facades of the seven exhibition houses, unusual lines of sight through the interior, asphalt floors and upward-spiralling pathways through the exhibition areas create a lively urban setting.\n\nExhibition and Experiences.\n\nThe permanent exhibition represents the core of the BMW Museum and takes visitors on a themed journey from the past into the future. The route leads guests through seven exhibition houses. The “House of Design” is all about the design process and charts the progression from idea brainstorming to style-defining product; the “House of the Company” explores the history and company culture of BMW; and the “House of the Motorcycle” studies the development of motorcycle design and engineering at BMW. The “House of Technology” displays the technical innovations BMW has employed to meet the evergrowing demands of car and motorcycle design. In the “House of Motorsport”, the history of BMW in race competition commands the spotlight. Here, we showcase the full spectrum of technical possibilities, turned into reality with no effort or endeavour spared.\n\nThe “House of the Series” details the development of individual model ranges, such as the BMW 5 Series. BMW’s lines of communication with the people who use its vehicles is the theme for the “House of the Brand”, which looks at customers’ personal experiences with BMW cars. This house also examines the subject of sustainability at BMW. In addition, the temporary exhibitions in the “Bowl” each have their own theme and are dedicated to particular subject areas at the company. Examples have included the BMW i brand and the overall sphere of electric mobility. Since the BMW Museum re-opened in 2008, it has used special exhibitions like these to present topics in which the BMW brand is deeply engaged.\n\nThe hour-long guided tour through the permanent exhibition gives visitors the chance to immerse themselves in the Museum’s wealth of exhibits and gain some fascinating background insights into the development of the BMW brand. The tours are led by recognised experts, who are more than happy to incorporate specific topics or areas of interest on request. The BMW Museum can also be explored digitally via accompanying content on smartphones or tablets. Here, visitors can find out more about the history of the BMW brand and have a lot of fun in the process. The BMW Museum uses cashless purchase options only – i.e. credit card, contactless methods or mobile wallet – for entry tickets, Museum tours and souvenirs. Entry tickets can be paid for online, using the ticket payment machines or at the cash desk. Guided tours, kids’ birthday parties and school holiday activities can also be booked online – up to six months in advance.\n\nThe BMW Junior Museum is designed specifically for younger guests. The BMW Junior Museum programme invites children and teenagers on a journey of discovery through the world of mobility and is available all year round. Workshops designed for the age group at hand allow young visitors to delve into interesting topics from different angles. The workshops feature fascinating content on topics such as design, architecture, art and sustainability, and fuel the creativity of the kids. The tour through the BMW Museum included as part of the workshops is designed to respond to the youngsters’ interests and meet their needs. Interactive elements allow them to explore mobility from a variety of perspectives and cast an eye over more than 100 years of car and motorcycle history. The workshops are held in German and English. The programme offered by the BMW Museum reflects its vision of an extracurricular place of learning for interdisciplinary educational experiences. The main objective of the BMW Museum’s educational offering is to encourage active engagement with the exhibits on display. The various workshops are geared to preschool, primary-school and secondaryschool children respectively.\n\nThe following workshops are offered at the BMW Junior Museum for groups and school classes:\n\nThese workshops can also be held as birthday celebration events, which include the option of either bringing your own food or booking refreshments from renowned caterers Feinkost Käfer. Several times a year, the BMW Museum also adds a Family Sunday with its own particular motto to the calendar. Here, the Museum lays on a wide range of attractions, such as arts & crafts, face painting and much more besides, and also invites guests to visit the exhibition areas of the BMW Museum. Along the way, the kids explore topics around mobility, design and sustainability. As part of its special school holiday programme, the Museum now also allows places to be booked individually for the Design Workshop held on every Thursday of the holidays. Here, children aged between 7 and 13 can develop their own vehicle designs under the guidance of our experts and with special tools."

      "content": "Munich. This coming weekend, BMW M Team WRT will make its debut with the BMW M Hybrid V8 in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) during the official sanctioned test at Daytona (USA). The hypercar from BMW M Motorsport will hit the track at the International Speedway sporting its new design and, for the first time, its new headlights. The track lights combine cutting-edge lighting technology with iconic design. Over the two test days, six BMW M works drivers will take the wheel of the two BMW M Hybrid V8s.\n\nThe aerodynamic updates to the BMW M Hybrid V8 for the 2026 season were already showcased during previous test drives, including the smaller kidney grille and the modified front splitter designed to optimise airflow and cooling. Now, Daytona will see the addition of another significant update: the new headlights. The advanced technology of the track lights ensures improved visibility for drivers during the numerous night races in the IMSA series and the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). These include the 24-hour highlights at Daytona and Le Mans (FRA), as well as the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA), Petit Le Mans in North America, and the FIA WEC events in Qatar and Bahrain. The track lights illuminate the car's surroundings even more brightly, helping drivers better assess race situations, especially in poorly lit sections of the track.\n\nIn addition to technological advancements, the new headlights also offer an iconic design element. The yellow accents of the yellow lights pay homage to the current generation of BMW M Motorsport race cars, as the EVO models of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M4 GT4 share the same design features. Furthermore, they are a nod to the high-performance vehicles of BMW M GmbH. For example, the current CS models of the BMW M3, BMW M4, and BMW M5 feature yellow headlights, as do BMW M models from previous generations. Alongside the headlights, the kidney grille of the BMW M Hybrid V8 will also stand out at night thanks to its unique contour lighting, BMW Iconic Glow.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, BMW M Team WRT will have five test sessions to gain initial experience with the hypercar on the Daytona International Speedway and familiarise themselves with the procedures of the IMSA series. The Belgian team, which already knows the car well from two seasons in the FIA WEC, will be supported at Daytona by BMW M Team RLL. This collaboration aims to ease and accelerate BMW M Team WRT's adaptation to the IMSA series. Behind the wheel of cars number 24 and 25, BMW M works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Robin Frijns (NED), Kevin Magnussen (DEN), René Rast (GER), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Marco Wittmann (GER) will alternate during the two test days.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “I am very excited that we can present and test the update of our BMW M Hybrid V8 at Daytona for the first time in the IMSA environment. The new design and headlights not only look spectacular but are also intended to further optimise performance. We will work hard on this during the test at Daytona, as well as in January during the Roar. The time we have before the 24-hour race at the end of January will be used as effectively as possible to prepare both the cars with their updates and BMW M Team WRT for the first season highlight.”"

      "content": "Sakhir. The hopes for a strong conclusion to the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) did not fully materialise for BMW M Motorsport. The season finale, the ‘8 Hours of Bahrain’ (BRN), proved challenging in both the Hypercar and LMGT3 categories. Over the course of eight hours, it was difficult to fight for the top positions. However, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), René Rast (GER) and Robin Frijns (NED) managed an impressive recovery drive in the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 of BMW M Team WRT, moving up from 15th on the grid to finish eighth. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Kevin Magnussen (DEN), Raffaele Marciello (SUI) and Dries Vanthoor (BEL), retired in the final hour due to a defect.\n\nIn the LMGT3 class, which had recently seen two consecutive podium finishes for the BMW M4 GT3 EVO cars, the #31 car from The Bend Team WRT finished seventh in Bahrain. Behind the wheel were Augusto Farfus (BRA), Timur Boguslavskiy and Yasser Shahin (AUS). Valentino Rossi (ITA), Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Ahmad Al Harthy (OMA) concluded their final FIA WEC race of the season in 15th position in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO entered by Team WRT.\n\nAmong the highlights of the 2025 FIA WEC season for BMW M Motorsport was a podium finish in the Hypercar class for the #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8 at Imola (ITA). In the LMGT3 category, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO achieved a total of four podium finishes: the #46 took second place at both Imola and Austin (USA), while the #31 finished third in Doha (QAT) and Fuji (JPN).\n\nThe day after the season finale traditionally features the FIA WEC Rookie Test in Bahrain. For BMW M Team WRT, BMW M works drivers Kelvin van der Linde and Charles Weerts (BEL) – who this season have won titles in the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC) and GT World Challenge Europe, among other successes – will complete their first laps in the BMW M Hybrid V8. Sheldon van der Linde will set the reference laps. For him and Raffaele Marciello, however, the focus quickly shifts to their next challenge: both are travelling directly from Bahrain to Macau (CHN), where they will compete next weekend in the FIA GT World Cup with two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs. Van der Linde will drive for Team WRT on the famous Guia street circuit, while Marciello will race with ROWE Racing.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The FIA WEC season finale with the eight-hour race in Bahrain turned out to be quite a turbulent weekend overall, both in the Hypercar and LMGT3 classes. In the end, the results were not what we had hoped for, as our clear goal was to fight for podium positions in both categories. Unfortunately, we simply lacked the pace in the race to do so. Nevertheless, we showed a strong performance towards the end, and the great battle of the #20 car for eighth place was a satisfying way to finish. Sadly, the #15 had to retire due to a loose right-rear wheel. In LMGT3, the #31 also achieved a top ten result with seventh place. Of course, our goal is to stand on the podium, but finishing in the top ten in both categories is still a solid achievement in such a fiercely competitive championship. Many thanks to Team WRT, who did an excellent job throughout the year in both classes. A big thank you as well to everyone at BMW M Motorsport for their hard work, and to all our partners for a great FIA WEC season. We will now carefully analyse everything and come back stronger next year. Congratulations to Ferrari for an incredible season – with their victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the manufacturers’ title in the FIA WEC, and the top three positions in the drivers’ championship. I think it’s fair to say it doesn’t get much better than that. At the same time, I would also like to thank Porsche, who are unfortunately leaving the FIA WEC at the end of this season. Thank you for the fantastic competition we shared – and all the best for the future!”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, BMW M Team WRT): “Overall, it has been a disappointing weekend. We were hoping for a better result here. When you are starting the season the way we did, you expect something different, but unfortunately, it did not go that way. We have a lot of work ahead of us in the Hypercar class to improve for next year. In LMGT3, we just did what we could. We were unlucky with the last safety car, otherwise we would have fought for P5. But yes, we are not racing to fight for P5. I hope that next year we can fight at the very front.”\n\nSheldon van der Linde (BMW M Team WRT, #20 Shell BMW M Hybrid V8, 8th place): “Unfortunately, it was not the ending we hoped for this year. We would have liked to end the year on a high. There was so much potential at points in the season but we just didn‘t put it together as we had hoped. But at the same time we’ve learned a lot about the team and the car. I feel like we’re stronger than ever going into 2026. So the goal remains the same to try and be world champions next year, but we have a lot of work to do in the off-season. Now I am going to the FIA GT World Cup at Macau, where I want to end the year with a success – and it’s a great opportunity to achieve my goal to win a world title. But I’ve got some very tough competition, firstly with Lello as my fellow BMW driver in the ROWE car and then secondly all the other very competitive cars. So the goal is to try and win the race. I’ve been there on the podium last year so we want to go two steps better.”\n\nRaffele Marciello (BMW M Team WRT, #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, DNF): “The season went differently to last year when we got stronger over the year. This year, we started strong but then it became difficult. After Le Mans, the season has been tough, to be honest. We will try to investigate what happened in the last races and we have some updates on the car, so hopefully this will give us a boost to be able to fight for something more. Next up is Macau, and that’s always a fantastic race. I won it twice, and last year, I nearly won it. So of course we are going there to try to win again. I’m pretty strong there, and so is Sheldon. So hopefully one of us can bring the victory home.”\n\nAugusto Farfus (The Bend Team WRT, #31 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 7th place LMGT3 class): “It was a good race. When you see how difficult this race was for us last year and how big the step was that we made in terms of performance. I think that P5 or P6 would have been possible without the last safety car. So well done for the team, the step they did was pretty impressive.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (Team WRT, #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, 15th place LMGT3 class): “Unfortunately, my first WEC season with BMW was not as successful as we had hoped. There were some highlights with the podium finishes in Imola and Austin, but overall, we were always in a difficult position in terms of pace. We constantly had to fight our way from the back, and that was not ideal over the course of the season. However, even though things didn’t go perfectly in the FIA WEC, it was still a great first year with BMW overall.”"

      "content": "+++ Automotive technologies from the BMW Group powering the hunt for Olympic hundredths on the ice track +++ Development of individualised spike shoes for bobsleigh and skeleton athletes reaches the next level +++ Data-based optimisation of material and racing line in luge for the new Olympic track in Cortina (ITA) +++ Images and video material available on the joint technology projects +++\n\nMunich. At the Olympic Winter Games 2022, Team Germany celebrated twelve gold, ten silver, and five bronze medals. The German Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton Federation (BSD) contributed the majority of them - nine golds, six silvers, and one bronze in Beijing (CHN). It was an outstanding team result that the national bobsleigh, skeleton, and luge squads are eager to repeat when the next Olympic Winter Games take place in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy (6–22 February 2026). Achieving that requires hard work in every area and a constant pursuit of optimisation. To this end, the BSD continues to rely on its technology partnership with the BMW Group, established in 2010.\n\nDrawing on BMW’s expertise, technological capabilities, and innovative strength from automotive engineering and motorsport, two projects have been advanced for the 2026 Olympics - both designed to deliver those decisive fractions of a second in the ice track: the BMW Data Coach in luge and customised spike plates for bobsleigh and skeleton shoes.\n\nIndividual spike shoes for greater push-off performance.\n\nIt’s no secret that start times in bobsleigh and skeleton are crucial, as they determine the speed athletes carry into the run - there’s no “gas pedal” after that. To translate their athletic power into acceleration on ice, athletes depend on the right footwear. The force is transmitted solely through spike plates on the forefoot, with more than 250 small, sharp spikes per shoe gripping the ice and converting energy into motion. Any improvement to these plates directly enhances performance in the track.\n\nSurprisingly, standard shoes are typically used in bobsleigh and skeleton - without considering athletes’ individual preferences or anatomical differences. The BMW Group identified optimisation potential and, together with the BSD, began developing custom spike-plate prototypes ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics for skeleton athletes. These plates can be mounted onto any preferred track-and-field shoe using existing spike threads for secure fastening.\n\nManufactured at the BMW Group Additive Manufacturing Campus in Munich, the spike plates are produced using 3D printing - a process BMW has been employing since 1991 across the entire vehicle lifecycle, from concept to production and spare parts. This highly efficient process uses a specialised design software that allows fast, automated, and athlete-specific generation of 3D-print data. Parameters such as geometry, stiffness, and spike shape are customised and adapted to each athlete’s shoe using 3D scans. This algorithmic design process offers enormous time savings and maximum flexibility as plates can be printed, tested, and re-optimised in rapid cycles.\n\nThe 3D-printed spike plates made their World Cup debut last season, with teams such as Adam Ammour’s using them extensively. However, development continued - athlete feedback and summer gait analysis data revealed that some athletes performed better with softer soles and plates. As a result, a second development track was launched, strongly supported by Felix Straub, brakeman for Francesco Friedrich’s team. In this version, the plates are milled from nylon, fitted with steel spikes, and then glued and riveted to the shoe.\n\nA key material challenge is ensuring the steel spikes withstand extreme loads without wearing or breaking. BMW specialists in materials and process engineering developed a solution: the spikes are plasma-nitrided - a hardening process in which nitrogen is ionized in a vacuum at high temperature and diffuses into the steel, improving surface hardness. BMW uses this technique for crankshafts in BMW Motorrad engines and in motorsport applications.\n\nNow, all athletes on the German bobsleigh and skeleton teams can choose between both systems, test them extensively before the Olympics, and select their preferred option. After four years of development, the result is a range of individualised options for every athlete, foot type, shoe model, running style, and push-off position - replacing the one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nData-driven optimisation of material and racing line.\n\nIn luge, the interplay between athlete and sled involves many interdependent factors — optimising as many as possible for the best run time is the key challenge. The BMW Data Coach delivers a major advantage by enabling data-based analysis and optimisation of these factors. The ideal interaction varies between athletes and tracks, much like individualised car setups in motorsport. For the 2026 Games, a new ice track has been built in Cortina, with only a limited number of runs available before competition - making data-driven insights even more valuable.\n\nBased on measurement and simulation methods, the Data Coach gives lugers new ways to fine-tune their sled setup and identify the ideal racing line. This approach is well-established in vehicle development and motorsport. Since 2016, the BMW Group and BSD have been applying and refining these methods in luge.\n\nSpecial sensors installed in the sled record extensive dynamic data, allowing each run to be precisely reconstructed using dedicated analysis software. The software was developed by former Junior World Champion luger Dr. Julian von Schleinitz, now Head of Tech Excellence at the BMW Group, who combines his athletic experience with engineering expertise. Over the years, the growing dataset has made the BMW Data Coach increasingly effective in identifying optimal lines and refining sled setups.\n\nToday, the data volume is so large that - combined with computer simulations - it allows predictive testing of new components and configurations virtually, before any physical prototype is built or a new line is tested on track. This significantly increases efficiency and insight within the complex system of sled and athlete.\n\nFor the Olympic season, the system - used extensively by 13-time World Champion Felix Loch and six-time World Champion Max Langenhan - has been further enhanced. The sensors now deliver more precise readings on wet ice, and the hardware has been miniaturised to fit into a regulation-compliant racing sled. This marks a major step forward, as the measurements now come from a sled identical to competition equipment.\n\nDuring the first international training period in Cortina in late October and early November, valuable data were already collected. These will now be analysed in detail to shape the Olympic race strategy. A second test event at the Olympic track in late November will offer another opportunity for refinement - before the athletes battle for gold in February 2026, where every thousandth of a second counts.\n\nFurther information, images, and video material:\n\nBMW Group 3D-printed spike plates:\n\nhttps://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0439879EN/customised-spike-plates-from-bmw-group-3d-printing-accelerate-the-german-bobsleigh-national-team\n\nhttps://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0439282EN/bmw-data-coach%E2%80%99-on-hand-as-world-championships-start-on-home-soil:-german-lugers-in-altenberg-again-relying-on-digital-optimisation-of-racing-line-and-material"

      "content": "Munich/Berlin. The Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 will be awarded to Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. The prize honours one of the most influential contemporary artists, who will be represented in Germany for the first time with a solo exhibition. His works, which range from sculpture and installation to conceptual practice, are characterised by sharp humour, bitter seriousness, and a profound reflection on social structures. Since its launch in 2000, this prestigious award has recognised artistic positions that have had a decisive influence on contemporary art and presented them to a broad public in Berlin. BMW has been the exclusive partner of this unique initiative since 2006. The exhibition accompanying the Preis der Nationalgalerie will open at the Neue Nationalgalerie during Berlin Art Week in September 2026.\n\n“Back in 2016, Maurizio Cattelan gave a fully electric BMW i3 a spaghetti-themed wrap as part of our partnership with ‘Rencontres d’Arles’. Creative freedom has defined BMW’s cultural engagement for over 50 years, through hundreds of collaborations across the globe. And it is precisely this freedom that Cattelan continues to explore to its fullest – with wit, intelligence, and often a sharp critical edge. Whether art reflects our existence or opens up new perspectives has been discussed since the Romantic era. In Cattelan’s case, it is always both. Social relevance and creative excellence come together here, just as they do with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, which BMW has supported for two decades. We congratulate Maurizio Cattelan on being awarded the 2026 Preis der Nationalgalerie and on his upcoming solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie,” says Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human Resources and Real Estate.\n\nBMW and Maurizio Cattelan collaborated at “Rencontres d’Arles” in 2016; together with photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, Cattelan created a special project based around the fully electric BMW i3. The so-called “Spaghetti Car” featured the vehicle completely covered in spaghetti-themed foil – a humorous and conceptual work that playfully addressed issues of art, consumption, and sustainability.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Maurizio Cattelan (born 1960 in Padua) has been one of the defining voices in international art. His iconic works – including “La Nona Ora” (1999), a figure of Pope John Paul II struck by a meteorite, “Him” (2001), a praying schoolboy with the face of Adolf Hitler, and “Untitled” (2003), an animatronic sculpture based on the protagonist of Günter Grass’s “The Tin Drum” – show how Cattelan uses shock, irritation and moral ambivalence to raise central questions of our time: guilt, responsibility, power, and collective trauma. Cattelan's artistic practice is permeated by an aesthetic of “comic existentialism” – a combination of humour and tragedy, irony and profundity, that makes his works appear both accessible and enigmatic. With this exhibition, Maurizio Cattelan returns to Berlin, where he co-curated the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006.\n\nThe expert jury for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2026 is made up of outstanding international directors: Emma Lavigne (Director of the Pinault Collection, Paris) and Sam Keller (Director of the Fondation Beyeler, Basel) as well as Klaus Biesenbach (Director of the Neue Nationalgalerie). In addition to the expert jurors, the curators of the Nationalgalerie and the members of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie were also eligible to submit nominations.\n\nEmma Lavigne, Sam Keller, Klaus Biesenbach say: „Nearly two decades ago, as co-curator of the 4th Berlin Biennale, Maurizio Cattelan played a decisive role in establishing Berlin’s international standing as a centre of contemporary art. Twenty years on, a solo exhibition at the Neue Nationalgalerie offers an opportunity to revisit and reflect on this formative influence within a new social and cultural context.\n\nCattelan’s practice engages enduring themes such as power, religion, death, humour and memory – concerns that resonate with particular force in Berlin, a city profoundly shaped by its complex history. As an Italian artist with an international career, he brings a distinctly European perspective to questions of identity, responsibility and collective remembrance. His works invite us to confront history in ways that are simultaneously provocative, critical and poetic.\n\nIn Germany, where forms of remembrance are currently being re-examined – between the last generations with direct connections to the NS era and a younger generation informed by global perspectives – Cattelan’s art acquires renewed significance. His iconic gestures, oscillating between exaggeration, irony, and pain, challenge the rituals of commemoration, evoke both history and its narratives, and open new vantage points on contemporary social debates. In a time of increasing political polarisation, his art can encourage us to view remembrance not as compulsion or obligation, but as a vital and relevant engagement with the present and the future.\n\nCattelan’s ironic questioning of authority and “truth” carries particular urgency today. At a moment when institutions – museums, politics and the media – are re-evaluating their credibility and social roles, he scrutinizes structures of power both within and beyond the art world, always without a moralizing tone. His works provoke reflection on personal responsibility, historical representation and the limits of institutional critique and authority. In an atmosphere of political and social hardening, Cattelan’s subversive humour acts as a liberating force. He reminds us that provocation and wit are not expressions of cynicism but forms of resistance and constructive reflection. Particularly in the German context, where public discourse often carries a strong moral charge, his art opens up spaces for thought beyond outrage and polarization. Cattelan is not an artist of straightforwardness. His strength lies in embracing ambiguity, exposing contradictions and posing new questions. This willingness to inhabit the in-between generates productive tension and reminds us that ambiguity is not a weakness but a precondition for critical awareness.\n\nThe Neue Nationalgalerie, with its iconic building by Mies van der Rohe, is ideally suited as a place situated between modernity, the 20th and 21st centuries, and the present day, to showcase Cattelan's work in all its complexity – as a mirror and commentary on our time.”\n\nChristian Kohorst, Chairman of the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie, says: “With Maurizio Cattelan, we are honouring an artist who addresses social issues with sharpness, wit and profundity. The fact that his first major solo exhibition in Germany is being shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie underlines the Preis der Nationalgalerie’s claim to bring artistic positions of international significance to Berlin.”\n\nMaurizio Cattelan’s exhibition at Neue Nationalgalerie will be curated by Lisa Botti, curator at the Neue Nationalgalerie, with Klaus Biesenbach, director of the Neue Nationalgalerie, and will open in September 2026 during Berlin Art Week with an award ceremony.\n\nThe Preis der Nationalgalerie, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, has established itself over the decades as one of the most important art prizes, showing its winners to make a significant impact both nationally and internationally. Today, the Preis der Nationalgalerie continues to be a tribute that reflects the vital international art scene and transfer it into an institutional context. In this spirit, the prize in 2026 will remain flexible and open for changes and will be continued in a new format for the first time at Neue Nationalgalerie. From 2026, artists who set international standards and whose work has not yet been comprehensively presented in Berlin, will be honoured through a solo exhibition. The change of location places contemporary art in dialogue with the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie and its history. The iconic hall of the Mies van der Rohe building provides the ideal setting for a concise, artistic setting. The exhibition is made possible by the FREUNDE der Nationalgalerie.\n\nFurther information on the Preis der Nationalgalerie and its comprehensive history can be found at preis.freunde-der-nationalgalerie.de.\n\nMaurizio Cattelan, 2025:BEING AN ARTIST IS NOT A JOB, IT'S A MALFUNCTIONART IS A WAY TO SURVIVE, NOT A WAY TO LIVEIF I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED ALONGTIME AGOSOMETIMES THE BEST IDEA IS THE ONE YOU'RE TOOASHAMEDTO SAY OUT LOUDFAILURE IS MY FAVORITE COLORI DON'T MAKE ART TO COMMUNICATE, I MAKE IT TO ESCAPEIF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING SERIOUS, WEAR A CLOWN'SNOSEI DON'T BELIEVE IN INSPIRATION, I BELIEVE IN GOOD TIMING ANDBETTER EXCUSESYOU DON'T MAKE A MASTERPIECE, YOU SURVIVE ONEBEAUTY IS THE PERFECT ALIBIMY GOAL IS TO VANISH COMPLETELY, LEAVING BEHIND JUST AQUESTION MARKAS LONG AS YOU DON'T CHOOSE, EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLEBEING ORIGINAL IS OVERRATED, BEING PRECISE IS TERRIFYINGGUILT IS ONE OF THE PUREST MATERIALS AN ARTIST CAN USESOMETIMES I WISH I COULD COPYRIGHT SILENCEIF I BELIEVED IN MESSAGES, I'D WORK IN ADVERTISINGI DON'T CREATE MEANING, I OFFER TRAPS FOR ITTRUTH IS NOT AN INGREDIENT, IT'S THE AFTERTASTEEVERY ARTWORK IS A LOOPHOLEYOU KNOW IT'S WORKING WHEN YOU START REGRETTING ITIF I WANTED COMFORT, I'D BUY FURNITURETHE BEST ARTWORKS ARE MISTAKES NO ONE DARED TO FIXA GOOD WORK DOESN'T ASK FOR ATTENTION, IT STEALS ITA BANANA ON A WALL IS STILL MORE HONEST THAN MOSTPEOPLE I'VE METTHE MORE YOU POLISH AN IDEA, THE LESS IT CUTSIF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT IT, IT WASN'T ARTCONCEPTUAL ART?

      "content": "- Check against delivery –\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nFor the BMW Group, several key strengths have long formed the foundation of our strategic course: our global footprint, our technology-neutral approach, our premium multi-brand strategy and broad portfolio across all relevant customer segments, and our ability to identify the potential of new technologies and bring them to road in each major region. These strengths give us flexibility and make us resilient, and we are benefiting from them now.\n\nAs a global company with global brands, we are used to dealing with varied conditions and unpredictability on the ground in each market.\n\nWe recognize the current dynamics in the automotive industry: major transitions in innovation, operating with a global supply chain, a shifting geopolitical framework with trade impacts such as tariffs, as well as a rapidly evolving market in China – to name but a few.\n\nWe remain focused on our long-term trajectory, while using our flexibility to adapt to the changing dynamics and are tackling them head on. This is what has always set the BMW Group apart.\n\nOur business remains on track and healthy. As Walter just shared, this is underscored by our Group EBT result over the first nine months – demonstrating the performance of the entire business including our sales development.\n\nDespite the challenging market dynamics in China, our overall global sales posted year-on-year growth of 8.7% in the third quarter; excluding China, it was 12.2%. Through September, sales in Europe were up 8.6% compared to 2024, while sales in the United States grew by 9.5%. These strong results helped compensate for the development in China.\n\nElectrified vehicles and M vehicles both drove global growth. With our technology-open approach and multiple premium brands, customers find products that fit their wide range of needs and tastes.\n\nIn the coming months, we will take this to the next level with the introduction of the NEUE KLASSE. Just two months ago at the IAA Mobility here in Munich, we unveiled the BMW iX3*, the first vehicle of our NEUE KLASSE. The response was tremendous – from visitors and fans from across the globe, media, analysts, and political stakeholders. A few weeks later we celebrated the official opening of our new plant in Debrecen, where production of the iX3 is underway.\n\nWe have started taking customer orders for the car, which have exceeded our expectations. Just looking at Europe, we see orders already extend several months into 2026 already. This confirms an exceptionally positive start for the vehicle.\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is BMW at its best. And starting with the iX3, it will set new benchmarks: from its performance data and revolutionary digital interface to its sustainability approach.\n\nThe BMW iX3 offers a range of more than 800 kilometers in the WLTP cycle. Thanks to its ultra-fast charging capability, the peak charging power is up to 400 kilowatts. That means: in just 10 minutes, the iX3 can charge enough to drive more than 370 kilometers.\n\nThe fully immersive digital experience will bring UI / UX to a whole new level. With the BMW Panoramic iDrive, drivers can intuitively keep their eyes on the road while all necessary information is perfectly in view.\n\nWith the BMW iX3, we will also introduce a new generation of driver assistance systems. The BMW Group is the first car manufacturer in Germany to receive approval for assistance systems in accordance with UN Regulation for Driver Control Assistance Systems (DCAS).\n\nThe approval enables the BMW Group to offer the Motorway Assistant with Level 2 “hands-off” function in numerous other models and countries in the future. This also covers an extended range of functions. More innovative assistance functions for urban driving will follow.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, the iX3 is explicitly focused on conserving resources and reducing the model’s environmental footprint – throughout the supply chain, production, use phase and recycling. In line with the principles of design for circularity, the iX3 is made up of one-third secondary raw materials.\n\nMoreover, Plant Debrecen is the first BMW Group car factory that operates and produces vehicles without using fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, under normal operating conditions.\n\nOverall, the iX3 is a perfect example of our strategy of reducing CO₂ wherever we have leverage. This will help us reach our near-term target to reduce our carbon footprint by at least 40 million tonnes CO₂ by 2030. Since 2020, we have been fully committed to the Paris Climate Agreement, with a target of achieving net zero by 2050.\n\nThe next NEUE KLASSE model, which we teased at the IAA, is preparing for launch: the new BMW i3. With the eighth generation of the 3 Series, we will bring the NEUE KLASSE and its technology clusters into the core of the BMW brand. Production of the i3 will get underway at our main plant in Munich in the second half of next year. Other locations in our international production network will follow with production of 3 Series variants.\n\nThroughout 2026, we will show how the NEUE KLASSE technologies will be integrated into further models, such as the 7 Series and the X5. By 2027, we will put 40 new models and model updates with NEUE KLASSE technology and design language on the road worldwide.\n\nThis all-new BMW generation will provide an enormous boost to our already broad and popular portfolio – with technology solutions tailored to customers in their markets.\n\nThis applies especially to China. The NEUE KLASSE products we will launch in China are developed together with our local engineering teams and Chinese partners – in the market, for the market. Our NEUE KLASSE architecture allows to integrate local tech stacks from leading Chinese tech players into our own ecosystem. This gives consumers access to innovations and features they are used to, including solutions from Alibaba Banma, DeepSeek, and Momenta.\n\nWith the NEUE KLASSE, we are again demonstrating our strength in mastering system complexity, integration and efficiency. We know what our customers want and identify trends in individual markets early. The result are products that perfectly integrate the best technologies – both in house and with partners – across regions to offer the best product substance to our customers.\n\nWhat makes the NEUE KLASSE so unique, is that we are rolling out the technology clusters across the entire portfolio – regardless of the drivetrain.\n\nOur technology-neutral approach continues to show its success and allows broad market access as consumer preferences shift. At the same time, we are making progress in decarbonization in the here and now. After nine months into 2025, Group sales of all-electric vehicles are up by 10%, resulting in a BEV share of 18%. PHEVs grew nearly 28% year-on-year, delivering an overall electrified share through September of 26.2% globally.\n\nEurope showed particularly strong growth – with BEVs reaching over a quarter of total sales, while BEV and PHEV sales combined for an impressive 41% share. Europe will also be the primary driver of our BMW iX3 sales in 2026.\n\nThanks to this solid result, we are well on course to reach our CO₂ fleet target for the year, just as we have consistently done for the past several years. For us, it has long been clear that we would meet the targets for 2025 – and, importantly, without penalties, pooling, or averaging.\n\nThis success with our technology-neutral strategy also gives our voice weight in the ongoing discussion regarding the EU’s targets.\n\nWe have reached our climate targets by following market demand and customer needs and by continually optimizing all drivetrain variants.\n\nIt remains critical for Europe to revisit the targets for 2030 and 2035.\n\nSetting an end date to a specific, successful technology will lead to a massive shrinking of the industry as a whole. It will harm European industry and also create dependencies that are unwise in the current geopolitical dynamic.\n\nTo achieve climate goals and create effective CO₂ regulations, we must take a comprehensive view – one that accounts for the full carbon footprint of the vehicle and its value chain, and that also values climate-neutral fuels such as HVO100. Such a holistic framework would reflect various market needs and uneven infrastructure development, while safeguarding Europe’s value chains, jobs, and industrial strengths. And – above all – it delivers genuine climate protection and real reductions in CO₂.\n\nCompanies should be free to deliver the solutions, taking customer demands and needs into account, while adequately investing in new paths and technologies to achieve the EU’s climate goals.\n\nIn this context, the BMW Group is very skeptical about the EU’s planned “Greening the Fleets” regulation, as it does not consider current market realities. Commercial fleets rely on high vehicle availability with high mileages. The currently inadequate charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure will not be guaranteed in all member states by 2030 either. Further fleet mandates and additional regulations that exclude individual technologies are not necessary to achieve the CO₂ targets. Moreover, they hinder technological development and introduce harmful market distortions contrary to customer preferences. Here also, we advocate for a holistic and technology-neutral approach.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWe are tackling the challenges in global markets head on, leveraging our strengths and implementing our long-term strategy. We have made significant investments and have created the right operating framework to deliver. Our flexible, global network, our tech-open strategy, our focus on innovation and our ability to master technological complexity set us apart.\n\nOver the coming months, we will deliver as promised. Starting with the iX3, we will rapidly deploy our ambitious strategy one vehicle at a time around the globe. We will continue to lead with product substance and solutions that meet our customers’ needs.\n\nWe therefore remain optimistic as we close out 2025 and move forward to 2026.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: energy consumption combined: 17,9–15,1 kWh/100 km (WLTP); CO₂-emissions combined: 0 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ class: A"

      "content": "- Check against delivery –\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the BMW Group continued its strategic course and maintained its global market position.\n\nBut before we dive into the details of the quarter, I would like to directly address our communication from October 7th.\n\nYou all know the BMW Group as an ambitious company.\n\nWe have always focused on identifying opportunities and realizing market potential, and our success demonstrates that this is the right approach.\n\nIn 2025, despite all known challenges, we were confident in the fundamental potential of the Chinese market.\n\nOur planning scenario was fully confirmed during the first six months, with a performance on the level of the second half of 2024.\n\nFor the second half of this year, we assumed we would see growth momentum.\n\nHowever, at the beginning of the fourth quarter we observed that this momentum had not materialized to date.\n\nSo, for the remainder of 2025, volume stabilization, rather than volume growth, now appears likely. Accordingly, we have adjusted our planning and now anticipate a consistent monthly run rate in China in line with the first half of 2025.\n\nIn addition, we have introduced measures to support the profitability and liquidity of our dealers in China.\n\nThese measures will also have an impact on our Q4 profitability.\n\nThe consolidation of our dealer network in China is progressing to plan.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWith respect to tariffs, the BMW Group has been fully transparent throughout the year concerning the impact on our 2025 financial results.\n\nOur original guidance given in March as well as our updated assessments in the Q1 and Q2 reporting were based on certain assumptions.\n\nAs mentioned in our ad-hoc announcement, these assumptions were not fully realized as expected to date.\n\nWe now anticipate a tariff-related headwind of 1.5 percentage points on the Auto EBIT margin for the full year.\n\nI will share further details on our full-year outlook later on.\n\nBut now, let me walk you through our Q3 figures.\n\nGroup earnings before tax totaled over 2.3 billion euros in the third quarter and exceeded 8 billion euros year-to-date through September.\n\nCompared to the first nine months of 2024, this represents only a slight decrease of 9.1 percent – a notable achievement in light of the current developments in the Automotive industry.\n\nAnd for the full year, we also expect a decrease in the single-digit range only.\n\nThis represents a full-year Group profit before tax of approximately 10 billion euros – despite the significant burden of higher tariffs.\n\nExcluding the impact of tariffs, pre-tax profit even exceeds the 2024 figure.\n\nWithin the BMW Group ecosystem, every segment contributes to our overall success.\n\nThe reported Group EBT margin stood at 7.2 percent in the third quarter and 8.1 percent year-to-date through September.\n\nThe reported Auto EBIT margin fell within our full-year target corridor for both Q3, at 5.2 percent, and year-to-date through September, at 5.9 percent.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs you know, the BMW Group is always transparent in its reporting, and we consistently focus on communicating our published figures.\n\nFor better comparability within the industry, allow me, nevertheless, to provide a few additional details regarding our operational performance in the Automotive segment.\n\nFirst: Auto EBIT includes the depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA.\n\nExcluding this depreciation, which amounts to approximately 1.1 percentage points, the quarterly margin would be 6.3 percent, and the nine-month margin would be 7.0 percent.\n\nSecond: Auto EBIT also includes the burden of extra tariffs, which amounts to around 1.75 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.5 percentage points through September.\n\nThis impact should also be added for a fair comparison of our EBIT margin.\n\nQ3 deliveries to customers at Group level increased solidly by 8.7 percent year-on-year.\n\nAfter nine months, the share of all-electric vehicles reached 18 percent of total sales.\n\nAnd with a share of 26.2 percent, more than one in four vehicles sold globally was electrified, meaning either a BEV or a plug-in hybrid.\n\nLet’s now take a look at how the Automotive Segment performed across key metrics.\n\nDeliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers reached 588,140 units in the third quarter.\n\nIn Europe, sales grew by 9.3 percent, and in the US by 24.9 percent.\n\nIn China, retail sales did not meet our expectations, with deliveries at previous year’s level.\n\nAfter nine months, global retail sales approached 1.8 million units, representing a slight increase of 2.4 percent.\n\nThis clearly demonstrates the strength of our global business model, with sales performance in Europe and the US more than compensating the challenges in China.\n\nSales of all-electric vehicles exceeded 100,000 units for the sixth consecutive quarter.\n\nQ3 revenues in the Automotive segment amounted to 28.5 billion euros, reflecting a slight increase of 2.4 percent year-on-year. Adjusted for currency translation effects, the increase was 6.4 percent.\n\nSegment EBIT amounted to approximately 1.5 billion euros in Q3 and 5.1 billion euros from January to September.\n\nThe reported EBIT margin – including the negative impact of BBA PPA and tariffs – came in at 5.2 percent for the quarter and 5.9 percent as of September.\n\nThat brings me to my next slide, taking a detailed look at our operating result of the third quarter year-on-year.\n\nAutomotive EBIT increased by around 900 million euros compared to Q3 2024.\n\nAs anticipated at mid-year, changes in currencies negatively impacted EBIT by 500 million euros, while raw material positions remained neutral.\n\nThe net effect of volume, model mix and pricing resulted in a negative impact of 300 million euros in the third quarter, compared to the previous year.\n\nBoth volume and model mix provided a tailwind, while pricing was a headwind.\n\nThis is particularly evident in China, where we see price pressure across all segments.\n\nFurthermore, since the end of June, Chinese banks have significantly reduced dealer commissions.\n\nWhile this led to a certain increase in transaction prices, as expected, it could not offset the negative impact of the lower commission revenues for dealerships.\n\nConsequently, we implemented dealer support measures in Q3 to strengthen dealer profitability and liquidity.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn line with our planning, we will continue to decrease our operating costs in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThis trend is once again reflected in our figures for the third quarter.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by about 300 million euros compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\nGroup R&D expenditure totaled 5.9 billion euros as of September. This remains significantly below last year's level, despite extensive product initiatives and intensive preparations for the first models of the NEUE KLASSE.\n\nThe R&D ratio according to the German Commercial Code stood at 5.9 percent after nine months.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased by around 200 million euros compared to the previous year.\n\nThese nominal cost savings of 500 million euros more than offset the negative impact from volume, model mix and pricing.\n\nOther Cost Changes provided a tailwind of around 1.2 billion euros compared to the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThis development results mainly from three areas:\n\nOn the one hand, warranty expenses were significantly lower year-on-year.\n\nIn Q3 2024, we fully recognized the necessary warranty provisions for the Integrated Braking System.\n\nOn the other hand, tariffs had a negative impact of around 1.75 percentage points on the Auto EBIT margin in Q3.\n\nThe majority of the improvement in other cost changes in Q3 results from the positive development of manufacturing costs and material costs.\n\nOverall, we reduced costs by over 1 billion euros in the third quarter and by approximately 2 billion euros year-to-date through September.\n\nIn addition to EBIT, tariffs also affect free cashflow.\n\nWhile refunds are recognized in EBIT, cash will rather be recognized in 2026 than in 2025.\n\nThis negatively affected free cashflow through September, and the timing effect alone will impact free cashflow for the full-year by a high three-digit million euros amount.\n\nFree cash flow in the Automotive Segment totaled 343 million euros in the third quarter.\n\nEarnings before tax amounted to 1.4 billion euros.\n\nThe net change in working capital contributed positively to free cashflow by around 300 million euros.\n\nThe negative net effect of capital expenditure and depreciation impacted the third quarter by 300 million euros.\n\nThe capex ratio was 5.2 percent in the third quarter and 4.4 percent for the first nine months.\n\nFollowing the peak in 2024, capex will decrease for the full year 2025. The capex ratio is projected to remain below 6 percent.\n\nChanges to provisions negatively impacted free cash flow in the third quarter by approximately 400 million euros.\n\nThis was primarily due to the consumption of warranty provisions.\n\nThe change in the position Other, amounting to around 600 million euros, includes income taxes paid.\n\nAfter nine months, free cash flow in the Automotive segment stands at almost 2.7 billion euros.\n\nFor the full year, we now target a free cash flow of over 2.5 billion euros, compared to the original forecast of over 5 billion euros.\n\nThis is driven by two factors:\n\nLower-than-expected earnings for the full year\n\nAnd tariff refunds that we expect to receive in 2026 instead of 2025\n\nWe remain committed to shareholder returns using both dividends and share buyback.\n\nDespite the lower free cashflow outlook, we will maintain our dividend payout ratio of 30 to 40 percent and will continue our share buyback program as announced.\n\nAs a result, the anticipated shareholder returns for the financial year 2025 will exceed free cashflow.\n\nLet’s now turn to our Financial Services segment.\n\nFinancial Services is a key component of our customer journey and an important part of our integrated value chain.\n\nAs a vital element of our financial operating model, the segment contributes consistently to our Group profit.\n\nNew business grew significantly during the third quarter, primarily driven by the changed competitive environment in China.\n\nThis contributed to a slight year-on-year increase of 1.9 percent in new leasing and financing contracts concluded with retail customers over the nine-months-period.\n\nNew business volume increased by 4.2 percent to 48.5 billion euros.\n\nThe penetration rate for lease and loan offerings rose by 4.1 percentage points to 46.4 percent.\n\nSegment earnings amounted to more than 1.8 billion euros, a year-on-year decrease of 14.4 percent.\n\nThe decline is primarily attributable to the lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles as well as a tax payment in the second quarter resulting from a revised operational tax assessment for prior years.\n\nResale income remains positive on a portfolio basis.\n\nThe credit loss ratio across the entire loan portfolio remained low at 0.26 percent.\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, deliveries increased solidly by 5.7 percent year-on-year.\n\nEBIT for the second quarter totaled 60 million euros, resulting in an EBIT margin of 7.9 percent.\n\nLet’s now turn to our outlook for the 2025 financial year.\n\nFour weeks ago, we confirmed that the Auto EBIT margin will remain in the guided corridor of 5 to 7 percent – more specifically in the range of 5 to 6 percent.\n\nWe also confirmed that deliveries in the Automotive segment are expected to increase slightly.\n\nAt the same time, the BMW Group adjusted its guidance for the following two key performance indicators:\n\nGroup Profit before Tax, which we now anticipate to decrease slightly compared to 2024\n\nReturn on Capital Employed (RoCE) in the Automotive segment, which is now expected in a corridor between 8 and 10 percent\n\nIn the Motorcycles segment, deliveries are now expected to decrease slightly, whilst the EBIT margin range is confirmed between 5.5 and 7.5 percent.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, we confirm a Return on Equity (RoE) in the range of 13 to 16 percent.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWe have invested early and significantly in the future of our company, in line with our long-term strategy.\n\nOur technology clusters are ready – paving the way for the broad deployment of innovations across our complete product portfolio.\n\nOur Gen6 battery technology will shortly hit the market and support profitability with cost savings of 40 to 50 percent for the battery pack.\n\nAfter reaching their peak levels in 2024, we are reducing both capex and R&D, as planned.\n\nWe are also maintaining our consistent management of operational costs. This is reflected in our figures for the third quarter and through September, and it will continue to be visible going forward.\n\nWith our highly attractive products and the NEUE KLASSE, we have the right levers in place to continuously strengthen our global market position, today and in the future.\n\nWe believe that our 2025 profitability stands out in the current business environment, with a pre-tax profit decline only in the single-digit percentage range year-on-year.\n\nAnd with our strong balance sheet as a solid foundation, we will deliver consistent returns for our stakeholders."

      "content": "Munich. The BMW Group’s performance in the year to date has been characterised by robust global sales development, disciplined cost management and a consistent strategic framework.\n\nThe Automotive Segment EBIT margin remained within the full-year target range for both the first nine months and the third quarter – despite continuing geopolitical challenges and intensifying competition. Customer deliveries rose slightly year-to-to date at the end of September, while free cash flow in the Automotive Segment stood at € 2,688 million after nine months. On Wednesday, based on these results, the Munich premium manufacturer confirmed its adjusted financial full-year targets announced in October.\n\n“In the third quarter, we once again proved that our business model is robust and resilient”, said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “We have all the right factors for continued success: a technology-neutral approach, exciting products, a strong global presence and outstanding innovation capabilities throughout the entire value chain. Thanks to our broad model and drive train portfolio, we were able to increase our global sales – with BMW M and our electrified vehicles as the main growth drivers. At the same time, we remain fully on track to meet Europe's ambitious CO2 targets for 2025 – without relying on flexibility mechanisms or pooling. This demonstrates that our technology-neutral approach is working and delivering strong results.”\n\nGrowth in electrified vehicles and M models\n\nYear-on-year, the BMW Group achieved a slight +2.4% increase in deliveries, reaching a total of 1,795,734 vehicles in the YTD September (2024: 1,754,157vehicles). In the third quarter, the premium manufacturer delivered 588,140 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers (2024: 540,881 vehicles/+8.7%).\n\nThe success of the BMW Group's technology-neutral strategy was particularly evident at both ends of the drive train line-up: In the first nine months, the strongest growth came from BMW M models (+7.9%) and from electrified vehicles (+15%). In the year to the end of September, electrified models accounted for 26.2% of total sales (2024: 23.3%), with BEVs representing 18.0% (2024: 16.8%).\n\nIn Europe, electrified vehicles gained even higher shares: they made up no less than 40.9% (301,947 units) of all sales while fully-electric vehicles comprised a quarter during the same period (189,269 units; 25,5%).\n\nThe BMW Group expects further positive growth momentum in 2026 from the all-new BMW iX3*, the first model of the Neue Klasse.\n\n“The response to the BMW iX3 has been extremely positive: In Europe, new orders significantly exceed our expectations, confirming the strong customer interest,” said CEO Zipse. “With the Neue Klasse, we are making a major leap forward – in technology, driving experience and design. Our entire product line-up will benefit from these innovations within a short timeframe: Between now and 2027, we will bring 40 new and updated models to market – across all segments and drive train variants. Next year, we will already celebrate the next premiere, with the BMW i3, as we electrify the heart of BMW.”\n\nDuring the nine-month period, the BMW Group benefited from its globally balanced footprint, which helps the company offset differences in sales performance across key regions worldwide. Excluding Chinese sales, the BMW Group brands achieved growth of +8.2%, with solid increases in the key regions of Europe (+8.6%) and the Americas (+9.5%).\n\nIn the third quarter, the BMW Group posted revenues of € 32,314 million (Q3 2024: € 32,406 million/-0.3%, adjusted for currency translation effects +3.4%). Year-to-date at the end of September, revenues were lower than the previous year, at € 99,999 million (2024: € 105,964/-5.6%; adjusted for currency translation effects -3.9%).\n\nSignificantly lower R&D spending and capital expenditure\n\nAs previously announced, the BMW Group has transitioned from last year's record levels of future investment, which were required for electrification and digitalisation of the portfolio across all model series, as well as for development of the Neue Klasse.\n\nExpenditure for research and development was down significantly in the first nine months, at € 5,941 million (2024: € 6,642 million/-10.6%; Q3: € 1,921 million;Q3 2024: € 2,473 million/-22.3%) – despite the ongoing product offensive and ramped-up preparations for the first models of the Neue Klasse. The R&D ratio decreased to 5.9% in September MTD as well as YTD (2024: 6.3%/-0.4 percentage points; in Q3 2024: 7,6%).\n\nAs planned, capital expenditure was also significantly lower, at € 4,410 million for the nine-month period and € 1,674 million for the third quarter (2024: € 5,641 million/-21,8%; Q3 2024: € 2,185 million/-23,4%). The capex ratio stood at 4.4% for the year to the end of September and 5.2% for the third quarter (2024: 5.3%; Q3 2024: 6.7%).\n\nA capex ratio of less than 6% is forecast for the full year, moving closer to the company’s long-term target range of below 5%, as planned.\n\nThe BMW Group also achieved a moderate reduction in sales and administrative expenses, in line with forecasts, bringing costs down to € 6,077 million for the year to the end of September (2024: € 6,587 million/-7.7%; in Q3: € 1,995 million; Q3 2024: € 2,188 million/-8.8%).\n\n“As previously announced, this expenditure was lower than last year in every quarter. We are reaping the benefits of having invested in the future early, with the peak now already behind us. In the fourth quarter, we expect further cost reductions, as well as lower research and development spending and capital expenditure. We are systematically managing costs with a measured approach, aiming to continue delivering captivating, innovative premium vehicles – and being consistently profitable,” said Walter Mertl, member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance.\n\nGroup pre-tax earnings exceed € 8.0 billion\n\nGroup earnings before tax (EBT) totalled € 8,056 million for the first nine months (2024: € 8,861 million/-9.1%)and € 2,329 million for the third quarter (Q3 2024: € 838 million).\n\nThe Group EBT margin came in at 8.1% for the YTD September and 7.2% for the third quarter (2024: 8.4%/-0.3 percentage points; Q3 2024: 2.6%/+4.6% percentage points). Group net profit amounted to € 5,712 million in the year to the end of September (2024: € 6,132 million/-6.8%; in Q3: € 1,697 million; Q3 2024: € 476 million).\n\nIn the first nine months, the Automotive Segment generated revenues of € 87,164 million (2024: € 90,863 million/-4.1%, adjusted for currency translation effects -2.2%; in Q3: € 28,510 million; Q3 2024: € 27,854 million/+2.4%, adjusted for currency translation effects +6.4%). Headwinds resulted from intensified global competition and financial measures aimed at supporting and strengthening dealer profitability in the challenging China market. Volume growth predominantly takes place there in the price segment below RMB 150,000 (~€ 18,000) and the growing product offer of local manufacturers leads to fierce competition across the entire market.\n\nAdditionally, negative currency translation effects, particularly from the US dollar, South Korean won and Chinese renminbi, have dampened income.\n\nThe segment’s earnings before financial result (EBIT) totalled € 5,120 million for the first nine months (2024: € 6,028 million/-15.1%; Q3: € 1,494 million; Q32024: € 634 million/+135.6%). In the prior-year quarter, sales and revenues were affected by technical campaigns related to the Integrated Brake System (IBS).\n\nThe EBIT margin for the YTD September came in at 5.9% (2024: 6.6%/-0.7 percentage points; in Q3: 5.2%; Q3 2024: 2.3%/+2.9 percentage points).\n\nExcluding depreciation resulting from the purchase price allocation of BBA of around 1.1 percentage points, the EBIT margin was 7.0% for the year to the end of September and 6.3% for the third quarter. Expenses resulting from higher import tariffs in the United States and the European Union further weighed on these margins: amounting to approx. 1.5 percentage points in the first nine months and around 1.75 percentage points in the third quarter.\n\nPre-tax earnings and lower capital expenditure boost free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow improved year-on-year, bolstered by higher cash inflows from operating activities, significantly lower investment activity (- € 1.4 billion) and reduced inventory levels, reaching € 2,688 million at the end of the nine-month period. In the third quarter, free cash flow totalled € 343 million (2024: - € 191 million; Q3 2024: - € 2,480 million). For the full year, the segment's free cash flow is now expected to be > € 2.5 billion (previously: > € 5 billion).\n\nThe BMW Group is implementing its share buyback programme with continuity and consistency: Following the renewed authorisation of the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025, the Board of Management has approved a third share buyback programme, with a volume of up to € 2 billion, to be completed by 30 April 2027. Acquisition of the first tranche of € 750 million began in May 2025 and will be completed no later than 8 December 2025.\n\nAs of 30 September 2025, BMW AG held more than 6.2 million treasury shares from the third buyback programme. Based on the authorisation granted at the Annual General Meeting of 14 May 2025, as of 30 September 2025, BMW AG had purchased shares equivalent to 1.01% of the share capital.\n\n“With the third share buyback programme since 2022, the BMW Group is consistently implementing its shareholder return strategy. We remain committed to our shareholders and stand by the announcements we have made. Our employee share programme will also continue,” said CFO Mertl. “At the same time, we are maintaining our payout ratio of 30-40% of net income attributable to BMW AG shareholders.”\n\nFinancial Services Segment sees continued new business growth\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, the number of new financing and leasing contracts concluded in the first nine months of the year rose slightly to 1,275,607 (2024: 1,252,251 contracts/+1.9%). This significant growth in new business in the third quarter (450,935 contracts/+12.1%) was mainly due to a shift in the Chinese competitive landscape, where local banks have substantially reduced their commission rates for brokering financial and insurance products to retail customers.\n\nThe segment's volume of new business also increased slightly to € 48,500 million after nine months (2024: € 46,531 million/+4.2%). This reflects growth in new contracts, with a higher financing amount per contract. The penetration rate increased to 46.4% (2024: 42.3%/+4.1 percentage points).\n\nFor the year to the end of September, the segment reported pre-tax earnings (EBT) of € 1,836 million (2024: € 2,146 million/-14.4%). This dampening effect was mainly due to lower income from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles, with the number of returned vehicles below the previous year's level. For the nine-month period, the credit loss ratio was in line with the previous year, at 0.26%, across the entire finance portfolio (2024: 0.26%).\n\nBMW Motorrad posts higher margin in YTD September\n\nWith 159,156 deliveries in the year to the end of September, BMW Motorrad achieved an EBIT margin of 10.8% (2024: 9.5%/+1.3 percentage points).\n\nFull-year guidance for 2025\n\nOn 7 October, the BMW Group adjusted its annual guidance for the following KPIs:\n\nDespite lower volume expectations for the Chinese market in the fourth quarter, the BMW Group is still targeting slight sales growth for the full year.\n\nIn the Automotive Segment, the EBIT margin for 2025 is still forecast to be within the guided target range of 5-7%, more specifically in the range of 5% to 6% in light of the earnings headwinds mentioned previously.\n\nIn the Financial Services Segment, Return on Equity is projected to be between 13-16%.\n\nIn the Motorcycles Segment, an EBIT margin within the range of 5.5-7.5%is forecast as before, with a RoCE of 13-17%. The segment is now anticipating a slight decrease in customer deliveries (previously: slight increase).\n\nThe BMW Group’s actual business performance may deviate from the expectations outlined above – for example, due to changes in political and macroeconomic conditions. Risks to earnings could arise, among other factors, from changes in tariff policy or Chinese export restrictions affecting rare earths, battery cell production or semiconductors. At the same time, opportunities could result from a reduction in existing tariffs or a shorter period of validity. The company continues to monitor macroeconomic developments very closely.\n\nThe BMW Group will continue to benefit from its young and attractive product line-up and from its proven technology-neutral approach.

In the US and Canada, end users also include (1) dealers when they designate a vehicle as a service loaner or demonstrator vehicle and (2) dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from the BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third-party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting of deliveries to the BMW Group – is made by independent third-party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenues that the BMW Group recognises in respect of that particular reporting period.\n\nProfit before financial result. Profit before financial result comprises revenues less cost of sales, less selling and administrative expenses and plus/minus net other operating income and expenses.\n\nProfit/loss before financial result as a percentage of revenues.\n\nEBIT plus financial result.\n\nProfit/loss as a percentage of revenues.\n\nPlug-in-hybrid electric vehicle.\n\nReturn on capital employed (RoCE). RoCE in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is measured on the basis of relevant segment profit before financial result and the average amount of capital employed – at the end of the last five quarters – in the segment concerned. Capital employed corresponds to the sum of all current and non-current operational assets, less liabilities that generally do not incur interest.\n\nReturn on equity (RoE). RoE in the Financial Services segment is calculated as segment profit before taxes, divided by the average amount of equity capital – at the end of the last five quarters – attributable to the Financial Services segment.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n\nBMW Group Corporate Communications\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Finance Communications\n\nTelephone: +49 89 382-18364\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann, Head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nTelephone: +49 89 382-24118\n\nMedia website: www.press.bmwgroup.com/deutschland\n\nWith its four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

      "content": "Madrid/Munich. Navarran artist Amaya Suberviola has won the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura for her work \"ST25061 (Coger una pestaña con los dedos)\" (Catching an eyelash with your fingers). In the Digital Art category, the award went to Madrid-based Chino Moya for his audiovisual piece \"Metapope\".\n\nWith this edition, the Premio BMW de Pintura celebrates four decades of uninterrupted commitment to culture and artistic talent, consolidating its position as one of the most prestigious competitions in Europe. Since its creation in 1986, the award has advanced the careers of more than 29,000 artists, helping to strengthen the ties between business, art and society.\n\n\"Art is a driver of transformation in thinking, and culture is an essential tool for the development of societies,\" said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, during his speech. \"Our support for art is not an isolated gesture, but a global commitment that seeks to build bridges between creativity, innovation and corporate citizenship.\"\n\nFor his part, Manuel Terroba, Executive President of the BMW Group for Spain and Portugal, emphasised that \"having reached forty editions is living proof that art and innovation, tradition and modernity, can go hand in hand.\" He added that \"the BMW Painting Prize has evolved with the times, opening up to new forms of expression such as digital art and becoming a showcase for diversity, innovation and excellence.\"\n\nA gala celebrating art The Teatro Real in Madrid was the venue for a gala presided over by Her Majesty Queen Sofía, at which more than 1,300 guests from the cultural, artistic and social spheres celebrated the 40th anniversary of this award. The BMW Group paid an emotional tribute to Her Majesty for her constant support of culture and the arts, as well as her commitment to social and humanitarian causes.\n\nThe BMW Group also paid tribute to Her Royal Highness Princess Irene of Greece, whose work at the helm of the Mundo en Armonía Foundation began at the same time as the Premio BMW de Pintura was created, in a clear commitment to bringing together art, culture and solidarity with the most disadvantaged.\n\nIn the same vein, and following the cessation of the Mundo en Armonía Foundation's activities last year, the BMW Group will donate the proceeds from the 40th Premio BMW de Pintura Gala to the Food Bank, with the aim of alleviating the vulnerability experienced by children.\n\nForty years of culture: a journey through Spanish creativityActor and BMW ambassador Álex González hosted the gala and, from the stage, highlighted the cultural significance of this anniversary:\"Forty years of Spanish history, of the evolution of our habits, our customs and our ways of seeing, living and creating. Because culture is not a luxury: it is a necessity. It is the soul of a people. It is what unites us when everything seems to divide us,\" he said.\n\nUnder this premise, the gala featured a musical show with the participation of the RTVE Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Salvador Vázquez, together with the Dúo del Valle, Antonio Najarro and José Mercé, who took an emotional journey through Spanish creation over the last four decades, from Falla to Manuel Alejandro, culminating in a performance of \"Se nos rompió el amor\" in tribute to Rocío Jurado.\n\nThe artist Alaska, responsible for one of the most acclaimed performances of the night, recalled her experiences and the cultural effervescence of 1980s Spain, the era in which the award was born, and defended the value of creativity as a hallmark of identity: \"La Movida did not end in the 1980s. It is revived every time an artist dares to challenge the status quo, and every time Spain reinvents itself. Because creativity here is not taught, it is breathed,\" she said.\n\nArt as a universal languageThis year's jury — made up of Antonio López, Miguel Zugaza, Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Guillermo Solana and Lucía Casani — selected the winners from among almost 2,000 artists of 38 nationalities, consolidating the Premio BMW de Pintura as a window onto the world and creative diversity.\n\nThe finalists in the painting category were José Ramón Amondarain Ubarrechena, Taxio Ardanaz Ruiz, Igor Arrieta Varela, Marta Beltrán Ferrer, Cristina Mejías Gómez, Simón Sepúlveda Braithwaite, and An Wei Lu Li.\n\nIn digital art, the finalists were Juan Carlos Bracho Jiménez, Amaya Hernández Sigüenza and Elisa Villota Sádaba.\n\nExhibition at Conde DuqueAll the finalists' works from the 40th edition will be on display for the first time at the Conde Duque Cultural Centre in Madrid from 20 November 2025 to the end of January 2026.\n\nThroughout its 40-year history, the BMW Painting Award has recognised artists such as Florencio Maíllo, Rafa Macarrón, Ángeles Agrela, Miki Leal, Santiago Ydáñez, Sonia Navarro and Damaris Pan, who have found in this competition a decisive boost to their careers. Forty years later, the award continues to be a celebration of talent, creativity, and the transformative power of art.\n\nThe BMW Group's Cultural Engagement, with exclusive updates and deeper insights into its global initiatives can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."

      "content": "\"With the new BMW F 450 GS, BMW Motorrad presents a genuine BMW GS in the 48 hp A2 class. It embodies the essence of a GS: Get on, twist the throttle, have fun - with full control and maximum confidence. Its low weight, superior performance and perfect balance between agility and stability ensure a particularly intuitive riding experience. Thanks to its precise handling and typical GS expertise, it performs impressively both on and off the road. The F 450 GS is the perfect 'best buddy' for every riding situation. It is uncomplicated, robust, and always ready. It sets the benchmark for sporty adventure bikes in its class.\" Markus Flasch, CEO BMW Motorrad\n\nThe new BMW F 450 GS: BMW GS expertise in the 48 hp A2 class in the iconic BMW GS design.The new BMW F 450 GS marks the next step in the GS model family, specifically addressing the 48 hp A2 class with proven GS technology and iconic design.\n\nAt the EICMA international motorcycle show, BMW Motorrad gave a preview of a fully-fledged GS model already in 2024, which specifically addresses the steadily growing market segment of medium-sized displacement motorcycles.\n\nThe series version of the BMW F 450 GS consistently lives up to this claim: It is a versatile all-rounder that combines everyday usability, sporty dynamic performance, touring comfort, and off-road capabilities. In the \"GS Trophy\" equipment variant, it follows in the footsteps of the concept vehicle. It adopts its striking design language and high-quality, high-tech components, including magnesium parts for maximum performance and low weight.\n\nWith its balanced power-to-torque ratio, low weight, and characteristic GS ergonomics, the F 450 GS provides riding fun and confidence from the first meter. The new F 450 GS thus combines the classic GS spirit with a modern, accessible, and simultaneously powerful approach.\n\n\"With the BMW F 450 GS, we are addressing a particularly broad target audience. This motorcycle is aimed at anyone who values ​​maximum agility, versatility, pure riding pleasure, and cutting-edge technology – regardless of whether they are on the road every day, on long tours, or simply looking for a light, dynamic, and uncomplicated bike. The current trend toward downsizing, i.e., switching from heavy motorcycles to compact and versatile machines, demonstrates the great interest in this segment. The F 450 GS offers the ideal combination of playful handling, maneuverability, riding dynamics, and high-quality equipment – ​​without compromising on quality or technical performance.”Astrid Neudecker, Product Manager BMW F 450 GS\n\nThe BMW Easy Ride Clutch (ERC) is a technical highlight and a further development of a centrifugal clutch. This system eliminates the need to manually operate the clutch lever while riding. This applies to all situations, from starting off and changing gears to demanding off-road maneuvers. BMW Motorrad is setting a new standard in this vehicle class.\n\nA range of attractive options will be added at the time of market launch: The F 450 GS can be equipped with an Akrapovic end muffler and original BMW Motorrad cross-spoke wheels on request. The result is a package that combines sporty dynamic performance, technical innovation and GS DNA perfectly.\n\nPerformance developed from scratch: A confident companion for both road and off-road riding.The completely redesigned BMW F 450 GS is a sporty adventure bike that complements the current BMW Motorrad model portfolio, with developers focusing on excellent handling characteristics, strong performance, durability, and optimum accessibility.\n\nThe design focuses on the consistent implementation of the current GS design language. With iconic features such as the LED headlight with \"X\" daytime riding light and the distinctive flyline, the bike's affiliation with the BMW Motorrad GS family is clear at first glance.\n\nCompletely redesigned, smooth-running and characterful two-cylinder in-line engine with 135-degree crankpin offset for dynamic riding pleasure on asphalt and off-road.At the heart of the new BMW F 450 GS is a completely newly developed two-cylinder in-line engine with fuel injection and a stainless steel exhaust system on the right-hand side. The new F 450 GS impresses with its powerful performance and pulling power, delivering a power output of 35 kW (48 hp) at 8,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 43 Nm at 6,750 rpm.Thanks to the use of high-tech materials and optimized internal friction, these performance values are achieved with exactly 420 cm³. This makes the engine one of the most compact and powerful in the A2 two-cylinder segment. It not only meets the strict EU5+ requirements but is also particularly economical, consuming just 3.8 liters per 100 km. A range of over 350 km can be achieved in conjunction with the 14-liter tank. The maintenance interval is the standard 10,000 km for BMW motorcycles.\n\nUnique on the motorcycle market, the engine features a crankshaft with crankpins offset by 135 degrees and, in conjunction with a single balance shaft, sets a technical exclamation mark: this design ensures a characterful, emotional ride while simultaneously reducing unwanted vibrations to an exceptionally low level.\n\nEasy Ride Clutch (ERC) for a significant increase in dynamics, operating comfort, and riding comfort.A technical highlight of the new BMW F 450 GS is the Easy Ride Clutch (ERC). Its core is a precision centrifugal unit in the clutch, which engages the clutch depending on engine speed.\n\nThis system is standard on the GS Trophy variant and available as an optional accessory for all other model variants. In combination with the Shift Assistant Pro, manual operation of the clutch lever is completely eliminated – from starting off and gear changes to demanding maneuvers.\n\nThe clutch lever, however, remains intact and allows the rider to intervene manually at any time if necessary – for example, to lift the front wheel over an obstacle or to improve control when descending on slippery surfaces.\n\nTechnologically, the ERC is based on an advanced centrifugal clutch. Unlike conventional systems, it remains closed during overrun. This creates natural, familiar, and predictable handling at all times – comparable to a conventional clutch. The engine brake remains fully active until just before a stop; only when the idle speed is reached does the ERC automatically open, reliably preventing the engine from stalling.\n\nThe system ensures greater dynamics, control, and comfort – whether maneuvering, in city traffic, on winding roads, or off-road.\n\nSix-speed transmission and left-mounted secondary drive. Shift Assistant Pro for quick upshifts and downshifts without clutch operation.The likewise newly designed six-speed transmission transmits torque to the left-hand secondary drive via an X-ring chain.For fast upshifts and downshifts without clutch operation, the new F 450 GS is offered with Shift Assistant Pro in all equipment variants except the basic variant. This can be retrofitted to the basic version.\n\n\"Rain,\" \"Road,\" and \"Enduro\" riding modes, as well as ABS Pro, DBC, DTC, and MSR (engine drag control), are standard features for a high level of riding enjoyment and safety. An additional \"Enduro Pro\" riding mode is available starting with the Exclusive trim variant.The BMW F 450 GS offers three riding modes as standard: \"Rain\", \"Road\" and \"Enduro\", allowing the motorcycle to be adapted to suit individual preferences. Standard equipment also includes ABS Pro, Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and engine drag torque control (MSR).\n\nThe additional “Enduro Pro” mode, which is used from the Exclusive equipment variant onwards, is designed for off-road use with coarse-tread off-road tires and allows the ABS on the rear wheel to be deactivated.\n\nNewly developed chassis with tubular steel frame for optimal rigidity, robustness, and driving precision. Short wheelbase for agile and playful handling.The new BMW F 450 GS also features a completely new chassis concept. Playful handling, optimum accessibility, high riding precision and riding stability were the developers' top priorities. The specially developed lattice-tube frame of the BMW F 450 GS consists of welded steel tubes and forged parts. The frame integrates the two-cylinder in-line engine as a supporting element and is designed to be lightweight yet robust.\n\nThe front wheel is guided via KYB upside-down telescopic forks, while the rear wheel is guided via an aluminum hollow cast double armed swinging arm with a KYB central spring strut featuring progressive damping.Front wheel control is provided by a torsionally rigid KYB upside-down telescopic fork with a 43 mm inner tube diameter. The Sport and GS Trophy variants feature the so-called \"sports suspension.\" The fork is adjustable for rebound and compression damping. Rear wheel control is provided by a closed, and therefore extremely torsionally rigid, yet lightweight, hollow-cast aluminum double-sided swing arm, coupled with a directly connected KYB central spring strut (adjustable spring preload and rebound damping) with travel-dependent damping derived from rally racing, a unique feature in this segment.\n\nWheels and tires tailored to the typical BMW GS applications.The new BMW F 450 GS features lightweight yet robust cast aluminum wheels. It is fitted with tubeless tires for road and off-road use, sized 100/90-19 at the front and 130/80-17 at the rear. Additionally, the Original BMW Motorrad Accessories range offers cross-spoke wheels.\n\nA powerful braking system combined with BMW Motorrad ABS Pro ensures safe braking even when leaning. Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) and Dynamic Brake Light are additional safety features.The front wheel of the new BMW F 450 GS features a floating single-disc brake with a Brembo 4-piston fixed caliper and a 310 mm brake disc diameter for superior, stable deceleration. A single disc brake with 1-piston floating caliper and 240 mm diameter is used on the rear wheel.\n\nThe new BMW F 450 GS already comes standard with BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. ABS Pro also offers increased safety when braking in curves by enabling ABS-assisted braking while leaning. Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) offers increased safety when braking, even in difficult situations, by preventing unintentional throttle application. The dynamic brake light effectively alerts following vehicles to the braking motorcycle ahead.\n\nOptimal ergonomics and equipment for comfortable, playful, and agile motorcycling on and off-road.A sophisticated ergonomic triangle and a high, close-to-the-body handlebar made of tapered aluminum tubing ensure an ideal riding position in all conditions. The body and the 14-liter fuel tank below it are designed for optimal support and good knee contact, both when seated and while standing off-road. A wide range of accessories are available to meet the individual needs of riders, including a handlebar riser, a rally seat, and the option of a low seat.\n\nThree different seat variants, adjustable hand levers, a handlebar riser, and secure footrests with height-adjustable gearshift and footbrake levers ensure optimal riding comfort both on and off-road.The new BMW F 450 GS comes with a two-part seat (845 mm) as standard. The low Black rider's seat (830 mm) and the high Rallye seat in Black/White/Red (865 mm), available as part of the Original BMW Motorrad Accessories, can be adapted to individual requirements. The standard adjustable handlebar levers and the optional 20 mm handlebar risers made of high-strength anodized silver aluminum offer further adjustment options.\n\nThe new BMW F 450 GS comes standard with a footrest system with removable rubber grips, whose serrated profile makes it suitable for off-road use. A very practical feature is the easy height adjustment of the foot brake lever by 20 mm in two positions to suit individual needs for on- and off-road riding. The gearshift lever is also height-adjustable.\n\nWider enduro footrests are included starting with the Exclusive version or are available as optional accessories.\n\nHigh touring and everyday performance thanks to sophisticated vehicle and weather protection, as well as a comprehensive storage concept.The modular design of the available windshields (optional accessories) allows for individual customization. Depending on the intended use and personal preference, you can choose between the high Tour windshield (height-adjustable) and the clear or tinted Rally windshield. This allows the comfort and wind and weather protection of the new BMW F 450 GS to be tailored specifically to individual needs.\n\nIn the event of a fall or tip-over, Original BMW Motorrad Accessories offer effective ways to protect your motorcycle from damage, including engine guards, engine protection bars, front axle protectors, and other protective components.\n\nThe diverse range of special accessories – whether side bags, tail bags, luggage rolls, tank bags, luggage racks, or top cases – offers maximum flexibility for every application.\n\nPowerful LED light units as standard. Connectivity featuring a large, perfectly readable 6.5-inch TFT display that provides comprehensive information and functionality. Practical USB-C socket in the cockpit area.The new BMW F 450 GS features an LED headlight with an iconic \"X\" daytime riding light signature as standard. The turn indicator and control lamps of the F 450 GS also use LED technology.\n\nA large 6.5-inch TFT display is also standard on the new BMW F 450 GS. The variety of information, display quality, and, last but not least, user-friendliness are premium. It comes standard with screen displays tailored to the BMW GS world: the Pure Ride Screen and the Sport Screen with detailed information on DTC, braking force, and lean angle. Taking phone calls, listening to music, and navigation while riding is also possible.\n\nFour attractive equipment variants for the new BMW F 450 GS.The new BMW F 450 GS is available in four equipment variants: the BMW F 450 GS Basis model in Cosmic Black and the BMW F 450 GS Exclusive, also in Cosmic Black, with off-road footrests, handguards, a plastic underbody guard, Riding Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, and a clear windshield.\n\nAnother equipment variant is the BMW F 450 GS Sport in Racing Red, featuring off-road footrests, handguards, a plastic underbody protection, Riding Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, a clear windshield, and the “sports suspension” (with KYB fork adjustable in rebound and compression). The fourth variant, the BMW F 450 GS Trophy in Racing Blue Metallic, tops the lineup. It features off-road footrests, white handguards, Riding Modes Pro, Shift Assistant Pro, “Sports Suspension”, a tinted rally windshield, an aluminum engine guard, and the new, enhanced version of centrifugal clutch: the Easy Ride Clutch (ERC).\n\nThe highlights of the new BMW F 450 GS:• Development focus: excellent handling characteristics, strong performance, durability, and optimal accessibility.\n\n• Outstanding power-to-weight ratio within the A2 class: 48 hp with a ready-to-ride weight of just 178 kg.\n\n• Sporty adventure bike with a twin-cylinder inline engine producing 35 kW (48 hp) at 8,750 rpm and a maximum torque of 43 Nm at 6,750 rpm.\n\n• Characterful engine with extremely smooth running thanks to a balance shaft and 135-degree crankpin offset.\n\nFour attractive equipment variants:\n\n• Easy Ride Clutch (ERC) for significantly improved operating and riding comfort, as well as dynamics, as standard in the GS Trophy trim level; it can be retrofitted to all other F 450 GS model variants.\n\n• Six-speed transmission and left-mounted secondary drive.

      "content": "Munich. 2025 sees the Bavarian capital host the annual One Young World Summit, a top conference of young leaders from across the globe. With delegates from 196 countries, the Summit is one of the few global events to bring young people from all continents together and offer them a platform. It is now being hosted by the City of Munich – for a second time. With its special mix of tradition, innovation and quality of life, Munich is the ideal place to pursue the shared goal of developing innovative and visionary solutions to social challenges.\n\nIlka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for HR and Real Estate, said: “The One Young World Summit 2025 in Munich brings together young leaders from across the globe to inspire and connect. For us at the BMW Group, social responsibility extends far beyond our products and organisation: by supporting One Young World, we foster responsible leadership and encourage young people to take a stand and remain committed to resolving the challenges of the future.”\n\nBMW Group fosters young leaders\n\nA premium partner of One Young World, the BMW Group plays an active role in the event series. It sees itself as an integral part of society and supports the development of solutions to meet global challenges. One aspect of this consists of fostering a generation of future leaders dedicated to achieving a responsible, just and forward-looking society. Since 2016 the BMW Group has had its own delegation of committed young leaders aged between 18 and 30 at the four-day forum, which it sees as an opportunity to contribute to a better future. This year it will once again be staging the closing ceremony at BMW Welt – a symbol of technology, design and emotional experiences.\n\nDriving change together\n\nThe One Young World Summit is an invitation to debate social, business and environmental issues, share knowledge and experience, ask critical questions and make lasting connections. The aim is to enable talented and ambitious young people to actively drive change. Delegates come from a variety of backgrounds, from business and science to NGOs. It’s in this diversity and passionate commitment that the BMW Group sees the potential of the international conference.\n\nWith a BMW Group delegation of more than 50 people, this year’s event will focus on education, the circular economy, responsible tech, combating hatred, and on peace and security. For even more impetus and different perspectives, a range of influential figures from business, politics, sport and culture will make guest appearances. One of them will be Philipp Lahm, former captain of the German national football team and 2014 football World Champion. He will be talking to Ilka Horstmeier at the opening ceremony of the Summit on 3 November in Munich’s Olympic Hall.\n\nIn a podium discussion during the four-day conference, Ilka Horstmeier will explore how effective leadership can help restore trust in institutions, science and democracy, and the key role of education in this. Her panellists will be His Excellency Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Under-General-Secretary of the United Nations and High Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC), and Gabriela de la Torre, responsible for gifted and talented education at the Mexican Ministry of Education and General Director of the Programa Adopted un Talento (Adopt a Talent Programme, PAUTA), which is dedicated to providing extra-curricular activities to support children and young people across Mexico looking to pursue a career in the sciences.\n\nThe BMW Group has long been committed to educational initiatives at its various sites, and a million children and young people have already benefited. Its longstanding collaboration with the UNAOC primarily fosters grass-roots initiatives to develop their knowledge of STEM subjects (sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics), which are important foundations to careers in exactly the areas that enable participation in global growth.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n\nBMW Group Corporate Communications\n\nWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services. The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide; the company has a global sales network in more than 140 countries.\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold over 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide.

      "content": "Munich. Since 2022, the BMW Group and Solid Power, Inc. (Nasdaq: SLDP) have intensified their activities for the development of all-solid-state battery (ASSB) technology through their technology transfer agreement. The latest milestone was the integration of Solid Power’s large-format pure ASSB cells into a BMW i7 technology test vehicle.\n\nAs of October 2025, Samsung SDI joins the efforts to pursue development and validation of the ASSB technology in the automotive field. The new collaboration marks a key step towards ASSB technology, bringing together the complementary expertise of three industry leaders. Under this arrangement, Solid Power will supply sulfide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI, which Samsung SDI will integrate into separator and/or catholyte and use to build cells, in each case subject to achievement of technical requirements. These cells will be evaluated based on performance parameters and requirements to be agreed between Samsung SDI and BMW Group. Ultimately, Solid Power, Samsung SDI, and BMW aim to develop and supply ASSB cells for integration into a next generation of evaluation vehicles.\n\n“We are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries,” said John Van Scoter, President and CEO of Solid Power. “Our solid electrolyte technology is designed for stability and conductivity, and by working closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.”\n\n\"Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately lead to innovation in electric vehicles,\" said Stella Joo-Young Go, Executive Vice President of ASSB Commercialization Team at Samsung SDI. \"Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercializing ASSB.\"\n\nMartin Schuster, Vice President Battery Cell and Cell Module at the BMW Group, says: “With Samsung SDI joining our partnership with Solid Power, we gain significant momentum on our path advancing the development of new battery cell technologies. This global collaboration is another proof point of our overarching goal: to be always in a position to offer our customers state of the art battery technology.” The partners believe in the potential of genuine ASSB technology, and the promise of higher energy density combined with increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials. With increased energy density, longer vehicle ranges can be achieved without having to accept disadvantages in terms of weight of the overall storage system. The BMW Group and Solid Power have been cooperating since 2016 through an extended “Joint Development Agreement,” which was supported by a BMW Group investment in Solid Power in May 2021 as part of a financing round.\n\nAt the end of 2022, BMW and Solid Power agreed to further deepen their partnership. BMW will operate a solid-state cell prototype line at the CMCC in Parsdorf, on the basis of a research and development license and with Solid Power's experience and expertise.\n\nSince 2008, the BMW Group has been consistently building up its competence in the field of battery cell technology. Since 2019, this know-how has been pooled at the BMW Group's Battery Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in Munich. The BCCC covers the entire value chain, from research and development to battery cell design to producibility.\n\nIn order to be able to quickly and efficiently implement innovations in the field of battery cell technology, the BMW Group cooperates in a network of around 300 partners, including established companies, start-ups and universities, among others. The BMW Group's battery strategy - to operate on equal footing with industry's leading cell manufacturers through deep know-how - has proven its worth. This strategically strong position in the value chain ensures the BMW Group access to all new and innovative battery cell research solutions worldwide."

      "content": "Munich. After an intensive year, the “Class of 2025” has completed the BMW M Racing Academy - BMW M Motorsport’s dedicated support program for talented young drivers from customer racing. Under the close guidance of a team led by three BMW M works drivers, Berkay Besler (TUR), Nerea Martí (ESP), Matt Million (USA), and Niels Tröger (GER) have received comprehensive training and support from BMW M Motorsport over the past months. Following the successful launch of the program, anticipation is already high for the “Class of 2026.”\n\nTo conclude their BMW M Racing Academy year, the four members of the “Class of 2025” spent a full week immersed in the world of BMW M Motorsport. At BMW’s headquarters in Munich (GER), Besler, Martí, Million, and Tröger enjoyed a guided tour of BMW Welt and the BMW Museum. They then participated in workshops on social media and brand building – and immediately put their new skills to the test: the group documented their joint road trip to Viareggio (ITA) in a BMW M5 for BMW M Motorsport’s official Instagram channel.\n\nIn Viareggio, the quartet once again trained with Formula Medicine – as they had at the beginning of the year – focusing on both their mental and physical performance. Under the professional supervision of Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his globally renowned team, the participants assessed their progress since the program’s start and evaluated their development. The “Class of 2025” also completed a 24-hour race simulation together, gaining firsthand experience of the procedures, challenges, and demands of endurance racing.\n\nThroughout the year, the four drivers accumulated many valuable test kilometers on real racetracks. In Miramas (FRA) and Varano (ITA), they worked side by side with BMW M works drivers on development testing for the new BMW M2 Racing. Martí and Besler also gained insights into BMW M Motorsport’s factory programs by attending the FIA WEC weekend in Imola (ITA), where they met Head of BMW M Motorsport, Andreas Roos and several works drivers. Meanwhile, Million joined BMW M Motorsport at the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship round in Laguna Seca (USA).\n\nThe participants were mentored throughout the year by a trio of BMW M works drivers. Jens Klingmann (GER) served as the main point of contact for the “Class of 2025,” supported by Max Hesse (GER) and Robby Foley (USA). The team was completed by Dirk Adorf (GER), who brought his extensive experience from previous talent development programs. Together, they provided expert guidance both on and off the track, offering invaluable advice, analysis, and feedback. Their presence at the participants’ GT4 customer racing events provided an especially valuable learning opportunity through direct, hands-on coaching.\n\nBesler, Martí, Tröger, and Million had earned their places in the Academy after a demanding selection process against a strong field of GT4 drivers last year. The selection for the second generation is already underway – and following the program’s successful debut, everyone involved is eagerly looking forward to the “Class of 2026.”\n\nStatements on the BMW M Racing Academy.\n\nBjörn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport: “I’m extremely proud that we were able to establish this development program again this year. Supporting talent from the customer racing sector is something both BMW M Motorsport and I personally care deeply about. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, the four participants made important contributions to development work, benefitting everyone involved. It was fascinating to watch how our ‘Class of 2025’ evolved both on and off the track. My thanks go to our BMW M works drivers Jens, Max, and Robby for their intense and constructive mentoring, which makes this program so special. We’re all very eager to continue following the progress of Berkay, Nerea, Matt, and Niels. After such a strong debut year, I’m very excited to see what the next generation of the BMW M Racing Academy will bring in 2026.”\n\nJens Klingmann, BMW M works driver: “It was great that, in the second half of the year, we were able to dive deep into the DNA of BMW – the values, the core business, the history, and the future – to broaden the participants’ understanding as drivers and give them a bigger-picture view. At the start of the program, we worked with Formula Medicine to assess each participant’s physical and mental baseline, and from there we built personalized training plans. Seeing their progress over the year was very rewarding. The 24-hour simulation was also crucial for teaching how to approach such an event, manage rest periods, and recover both mentally and physically. For drivers without prior endurance experience, that’s a real eye-opener. Overall, my impression is extremely positive. It was a lot of fun, and we were able to give the participants behind-the-scenes insights that money can’t buy. I’m happy that we could always be there for them – whether analyzing onboard footage, answering questions, or sharing advice. I wish all four of them the very best and hope they can apply everything they’ve learned in the BMW M Racing Academy to their future careers, both on and off the track.”\n\nBerkay Besler, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “Racing for a brand like BMW is already something very special to me, but being part of the BMW family through the Academy made it even more meaningful. Having such close contact with all members of this big organization was incredibly valuable. The relationship with the three mentors was essential – especially since I’ve known Max for a long time and could exchange ideas with him throughout the year. I also spent a lot of time with Jens during the BMW M2 Racing tests, and his influence on my performance has been huge. After every test, we wrote reports to share with him, and after every race, I did race reports with my engineer – something I had never done before. It really helps us improve and analyze our weaknesses. I’ve also adapted my nutrition and training routines based on what I learned at Formula Medicine and use mental techniques during races to enhance my focus. All these experiences will be crucial for my future racing career.”\n\nNerea Martí, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy provided me with a complete preparation both on and off the track. I’m very grateful for the close connection to BMW and the opportunity to learn from everyone involved. I’ve learned to pay attention to small details and to plan my development strategically – from physical and mental preparation to communication and social media presence. The program has taught me how to prepare properly off the track, apply the right training methods, and balance physical and mental aspects to deliver my best performance. The chance to interact with our mentors and everyone involved in the program was incredibly valuable. Their experience, advice, and feedback had a big impact on my growth as a driver, and I’m confident that their guidance will continue to help me in the future.”\n\nMatt Million, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “My key takeaways fall into three categories: professionalism, performance, and in-depth knowledge of BMW M and BMW M Motorsport. The mentors in particular gave me a clear understanding of how to act as a BMW M driver and brand ambassador, both on and off the track. The conversations with Robby Foley and Max Hesse helped me build a framework for planning my next career steps. Overall, the program elevated me in every aspect as a driver and ambassador – from physical and mental training to recovery and team feedback. I’ve also started using media and interview opportunities much more effectively to represent myself and the brand. Sharing my story from the BMW M Racing Academy and my journey feels special. Representing the brand I raced with for years in club racing is personally a magical story for me.”\n\nNiels Tröger, BMW M Racing Academy participant: “The BMW M Racing Academy has given me insights into professional motorsport that you wouldn’t normally get. During the BMW M2 Racing tests, I gained my first experience in race car development, and working directly with the engineers was unique and highly educational. With the help of our mentors, especially Jens, I’ve learned how to give precise feedback to my race engineer. Thanks to our Formula Medicine training, I now prepare for races in a completely different way and can perform much better. All these important experiences have helped me develop further as a driver. Overall, the BMW M Racing Academy has made me a more complete racer.”\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M5 Sedan: energy consumption weighted combined: 17,6–17,2 kWh/100 km and 5–4,8 l/100 km (WLTP); CO₂ emissions weighted combined: 114–108 g/km (WLTP); CO₂ classes: unloaded battery G; weighted combined B.

      "content": "Munich. Comfortably rest your hands in your lap and initiate overtaking maneuvers with a glance in the wing mirror – BMW customers will soon be able to experience this in many more European countries with the Motorway Assistant*. The BMW Group is the first car manufacturer in Germany to receive approval for driver assistance systems for the new BMW iX3 in accordance with UN Regulation No. 171 for Driver Control Assistance Systems (DCAS). The DCAS regulation provides an international legal framework for innovative Level 2 driver assistance systems with a focus on customer safety. The approval enables the BMW Group to offer the Motorway Assistant* with Level 2 \"hands-off\" function in numerous other models and countries in the future, as well as with an extended range of functions. Further innovative assistance functions will also follow for urban driving scenarios. The current generation of the Motorway Assistant has just been awarded the Tech Award in the \"Comfort assistance systems\" category by the German car magazine \"auto motor und sport\".\n\nDr. Mihiar Ayoubi, Senior Vice President Driving Experience Development:\n\n\"The safety-oriented DCAS-regulation ensures that we can launch our Motorway Assistant with hands-off function in many more countries. Further innovative assistance systems with our special, symbiotic approach between vehicle and driver will follow. We are creating a perfect interplay between rule-based algorithms and artificial intelligence. The driver remains involved, our systems are controllable at all times, and their behaviour is reproducible.\"\n\nWhen the Motorway Assistant is activated, drivers can take their hands off the steering wheel permanently at speeds of up to 130 km/h, but must remain attentive and ready to intervene. The system assists with vehicle guidance within its own lane and can also change lanes automatically if necessary - all the driver needs to do is confirm this with a glance. The new DCAS approval also enables even more extensive functions. With active BMW Maps route guidance, the system suggests a lane change in good time at Motorway junctions and exits, which can be confirmed with a glance in the wing mirror. The Motorway Assistant remains active when driving through freeway junctions and until the end of freeway exits. This means that drivers of the BMW iX3 can enjoy Level 2 driver assistance in even more situations without touching the steering wheel.\n\nThe new Motorway and City Assistant* of the BMW iX3 also offers innovative functions for urban areas. At market launch in Germany, these include stopping at red lights and driving off again automatically. Further driver assistance functions for complex driving situations in urban areas will be rolled out at a later point in time via over-the-air software updates.\n\nThe Motorway Assistant of the previous technology generation celebrated its premiere in the current 5 Series Sedan in 2023. The BMW Group had received a limited exemption from the Federal Motor Transport Authority in Germany for the approval of the system. With DCAS approval, exemptions are no longer required, and the systems can be offered throughout Europe and in other ECE countries.\n\nBMW Symbiotic Drive: next-generation symbiotic driver assistance.\n\nIn addition to the new possibilities offered by the DCAS regulation for driver assistance systems, the BMW Group continues to consistently design its systems so that driver and driver assistance work together symbiotically. BMW Symbiotic Drive creates a seamless transition between assistance and driver input and reaches the next level of development in the “Neue Klasse” vehicles. In addition to symbiotic steering, the BMW iX3 is the world's first model with symbiotic brakes. With active driver assistance, the driver can influence the system individually at any time according to their wishes by lightly intervening in steering and braking without switching off the driver assistance. The system remains active to provide support. The innovative power of the symbiotic brake is underpinned by more than two dozen BMW Group patent applications resulting from the development of these technologies.\n\n* The Highway & City Assistant will be available in Germany for market launch of the BMW iX3. Other countries and functions will follow. The availability, range of functions and system limits of the Highway & City Assistant may vary from country to country.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km."

      "content": "Las Vegas. Following its successful appearance at ApeFest 2024 in Lisbon, BMW was also in attendance at this year’s edition of the Web3 tech community event. This latest chapter in its collaboration with the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) community strengthened the connection between digital culture, technology and lifestyle. ApeFest 2025 took place on 24 October at first-time venue Las Vegas, and included a close-quarters tie-up with the ComplexCon event (25 – 26 October) fusing street culture, fashion, art and technology.\n\n“We’re delighted to be collaborating with the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). The partnership gives us the opportunity to drive forward the digital transformation ‘in BMW style’ and to further expand our Web3 knowledge. And this, in turn, will create a playground for innovative brand and product experiences from BMW,” says Ulrike von Mirbach, Vice President, BMW Customer Formats and Brand Experiences.\n\nApeFest is an annual event hosted by the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). It primarily attracts owners of digital goods known as NFTs, which are based on the cutting-edge blockchain technology also playing an important role at BMW. The BAYC is one of the most renowned NFT collections held by US firm Yuga Labs and comprises a total of 10,000 unique digital collector's items depicting stylized ape motifs. ApeFest is aimed at a highly tech-savvy community of people fuelled by extraordinary creative energy and an insatiable thirst for innovation – making this an ideal match-up for the BMW brand. The community gathers at ApeFest to connect and shape the future of Web3 technology, to gain access to exclusive digital content and experiences, and to develop new business ideas. BMW lined up as a partner of the event once again this year – and shone its Las Vegas spotlight on three key themes:\n\nIn-car gaming becomes part of the driving experience. BMW, in collaboration with AirConsole and Bandai Namco, has developed the exclusive PAC-MAN Championship Edition* game for its vehicles. In this unique iteration, the iconic PAC-MAN sets out to collect cars such as a BMW M Baby Racer and a BMW XM Label, along with items from the BMW M Lifestyle Collection.\n\nThe game was premiered at ApeFest as an AirConsole experience in a BMW XM Label. With PAC-MAN celebrating the 45th anniversary of its classic debut, this ranks as a headline collaboration. The BMW XM Label, renowned for its blend of performance, extrovert character and technology, effectively becomes the stage for this legendary game. Following its launch at ApeFest, the PAC-MAN Championship Edition* will be made available across all suitably specified BMW models.\n\nThis roll-out allows players to fully immerse themselves in the world of PAC-MAN directly in their vehicle, highlighting a tangible link between vehicle technology, entertainment and digital innovation.\n\nBMW already offers a range of games with AirConsole, providing a premium in-car entertainment experience. A key feature here is the use of smartphones as controllers; players simply scan a QR code on the vehicle's display to connect. The system creates a unique and seamless gaming experience, even supporting a multiplayer mode that allows up to seven people to play together, turning the car into a mobile arcade for the whole family.\n\n*PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition & ©Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.\n\nBMW Lifestyle Collection takes a turn for the digital.Another focal point at ApeFest was the presentation of the new BMW M Collection, which has been customised by the company’s collaboration partner and carries Bored Ape Bimmer Club (BABC) branding.\n\nThe Collection was revealed as part of a live show fronted by animated 3D character “Max”, BMW’s very own digital ape. With a presentation big on charm and innovation, Max acted as a model bridging real-world fashion and digital experience.\n\nQR codes transported visitors directly to the Collection’s product pages. The interplay of physical and digital elements created a new form of brand showcase – open, authentic and technologically on point.\n\nThe art installation: design as a shared experience. BMW also made a statement with a live performance by the artist Pauser (@Pausrr), who turned 24 black BMW suitcases into large-format graffiti art. Each of the suitcases was designed individually and personalised with e.g. initials and personal symbols, making it a one-off collector’s item that was then sold.\n\nThe installation embodied the themes of identity, mobility and design. And the standalone individual pieces were arranged into a complex artwork that underscored once again the community-led character of the initiative.\n\nPerformance meets digital culture. BMW was also represented at the event by an exclusive VIP fleet of vehicles including the BMW XM Label and BMW X7. Another star of ApeFest was a strikingly styled BMW M3 from the BMW Performance Center USA (Thermal), which served as a content studio for creators, media and guests. The high-performance model became a hotspot for video, photos and interviews focusing on design, technology and lifestyle. This was a place where product experiences and digital communication overlapped.\n\nThe BMW presence in Las Vegas was designed as an open-ended brand platform – with zones for gaming, fashion, art and connecting. The result was a space emphasising interaction and the sharing of ideas over traditional product presentations. Classic cars from the regional BMW community – members from southern California showed off their pride and joy at AREA15 – provided a bridge between the past and the future.\n\nBy hooking up with ApeFest once again, BMW has strengthened its presence in a space that mixes technological and cultural trends – and provided another demonstration of how mobility, lifestyle and digital culture can engage and connect with one another."

      "content": "Munich. BMW and MINI will be hosting attention-grabbing stands at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Taking to the stage in Tokyo on 31 October – 9 November will be a host of future-focused BMW and MINI models and technologies, including the first new Neue Klasse model BMW iX3, hydrogen fuel cell technology, the MINI family including new MINI Paul Smith Edition, the special-edition BMW M2 CS* and the BMW Concept Speedtop concept car. BMW Motorrad will also be represented at the event – in the form of the fully electric BMW CE 02 and the BMW M 1000 RR ridden by Toprak Razgatlıoğlu to his second successive FIM Superbike World Championship crown in 2025. On 29 and 30 October, representatives of the international media will have an early opportunity to take in the compelling exhibits from the three brands at the 1,100-square-metre stand in Tokyo’s Big Sight exhibition centre. Visitors to the show can also experience in-car gaming with AirConsole, which is making its debut with BMW Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will be among the vehicles offering customers this function, which brings with it world-renowned titles such as UNO® Car Party!, Hot Wheels: Xtreme OverdriveTM and PAC-MANTM Championship Edition.\n\nAsian premiere for the new BMW iX3, the first new Neue Klasse model.\n\nThe Japan Mobility Show will host the Asian premiere of the first new Neue Klasse model: the BMW iX3. Lining up alongside the iX3 will be revolutionary technologies that point the way to the future of the BMW Group as a whole. Visitors to the Japan Mobility Show will see the new BMW iX3 reveal technological leaps forward in a host of different areas: electric mobility, display and control/operation concept, digitalisation, connectivity, design and sustainability. All future BMW models will benefit from the innovations brought by the Neue Klasse – regardless of the type of drive system they use.\n\nProduction of the BMW iX3 for Japan is scheduled to begin in March 2026, with sales through the Japanese BMW dealer network currently due to begin in the second half of 2026. The BMW iX3 launches an all-new design language for the BMW brand that faithfully conveys the technological advances achieved. The revolutionary display and control/operation concept BMW Panoramic iDrive with the new BMW Panoramic Vision and new BMW Operating System X redefines the user experience and creates flawless driver orientation in the BMW mould. The zonal electronics architecture featuring four high-performance computers – the “superbrains” – provides the basis for the software-defined vehicle. One of these high-performance computers is the Heart of Joy: with the BMW Dynamic Performance Control software developed fully in-house, it can manage the driving characteristics of the overall vehicle from a standstill to the dynamic limit. As the first new Neue Klasse model – with sixth-generation (Gen6) BMW eDrive, cylindrical-cell battery and new electric motors – the new BMW iX3 embodies major technological progress. A maximum charging rate of 400 kW enables 372 km (231 miles) of range to be added in ten minutes, and bidirectional charging functions turn the car into a powerbank on wheels.\n\nThe new BMW iX5 Hydrogen* from 2028.\n\nProduct diversity continues to be a key success factor for the BMW Group. A wide-ranging portfolio of drive systems – encompassing internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrids, battery-electric drive systems and, starting with the new BMW iX5 Hydrogen in 2028, hydrogen fuel cell technology – lays the foundations for successfully meeting the varying demands and needs of customers worldwide both now and in the future.\n\nThe hydrogen drive technology is based on the third-generation fuel cell system that the BMW Group is developing in collaboration with the Toyota Motor Corporation. This technological advance paves the way for a system with a more compact design that is also more powerful and efficient, thereby increasing range and output at the same time as reducing energy consumption. Competence centres in Munich and at BMW Group Plant Steyr are building initial prototypes for this technology. And BMW Group Plant Landshut is supplying additional components for the drive system.\n\nWorld premiere for the MINI Paul Smith Edition.\n\nBack in 1998, Paul Smith lent his signature to a limited-run edition of the classic Mini. And MINI and the British designer have since linked up to bring a number of other projects to fruition. Fast forward to the present day and the Japan Mobility Show 2025 will provide the setting for the latest milestone in this tradition-steeped collaboration: the world premiere of the new MINI Paul Smith Edition. For this special-edition car, Paul Smith brings his world-renowned “classic with a twist” design language to the MINI Cooper family. The styling and details of the cars bring together the unmistakable style of Paul Smith with the playful, upbeat and independent spirit of the MINI brand.\n\nExclusive exterior colours such as Nottingham Green and sophisticated design elements like the Paul Smith “signature stripe” accentuate the distinctive looks of the MINI Paul Smith Edition. Standard specification for the MINI Paul Smith Edition includes 18-inch Night Flash Spoke black alloy wheels with accents in Dark Steel. And a Paul Smith signature on the wheel trims and black horizontal boot lid handle marks out the special-edition cars. The MINI Paul Smith Edition will be offered for the MINI Cooper 3-Door, 5-Door and MINI Cooper Convertible models. Worldwide sales of the fully electric variants of the MINI Paul Smith Edition will get underway with the world premiere at the Japan Mobility Show, while orders for variants with an internal combustion engine will open in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nJapan premiere for the special-edition BMW M2 CS.\n\nThe special-edition BMW M2 CS is celebrating its Japanese premiere at the BMW Group stand at the Japan Mobility Show 2025. Its high-revving six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinTurbo technology – an upgraded version of the unit found in the standard M2 – develops an impressive 390 kW/530 hp at 6,250 rpm. In so doing, the compact high-performance sports car from BMW M GmbH raises the bar for undiluted driving pleasure a notch higher still.\n\nThe standard-fitted eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic sends the engine’s power to the rear wheels of the BMW M2 CS. Judicious application of lightweight design techniques including the use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) reduces the weight of the special edition by around 30 kilograms compared to the standard M2. Thanks to the car’s lighter weight and lightning-fast power delivery, the BMW M2 CS is able to break the four-second barrier for the sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) with a time of 3.8 seconds. The figure calculated using the “1-foot rollout” method** is 3.5 seconds. The mid-range sprint from 80 to 120 km/h (50 – 75 mph) takes 3.4 seconds and top speed is electronically limited to 302 km/h (188 mph). The chassis technology and braking system of the BMW M2 CS are precisely tailored to the uprated performance characteristics of the engine and the specific weight balance of the special edition, which has an eight-millimetre-lower ride height.\n\nThe striking exterior of the BMW M2 CS is headlined by a host of components made from CFRP and exclusive details such as the M exterior mirror caps familiar from the BMW M2*, the M Carbon roof – which comes as standard on the special-edition model – and the CS-specific rear diffusor. The interior of the new BMW M2 CS combines an exclusive look with the sporty feel of exquisite Alcantara and innovative lightweight design, examples of which include the CFRP centre console and the weight-optimised, heated M Carbon front bucket seats finished in Merino leather.\n\nWith in-car gaming via AirConsole, users can enjoy world-renowned classic titles.\n\nVisitors to the BMW Group stand in Tokyo can also experience in-car gaming via AirConsole, as introduced for the first time with BMW Operating System 8.5. The new BMW iX3 will offer this feature, which comes with world-renowned titles like the classic card game UNO® from Mattel – here tailored for in-car gaming and renamed “UNO® Car Party!”. Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) is a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world.\n\nBMW customers also gain exclusive access to the Hot Wheels: Xtreme OverdriveTM game that AirConsole – in collaboration with Mattel – has added to its game library. In this game, players can earn points with the virtual BMW Vision Neue Klasse X in races on the Panoramic Drive Track, unlock legendary Hot Wheels cars and customize them. This makes every race a showcase for the performance and style of the BMW Vision Neue Klasse X.\n\nAt the same time, AirConsole will also release PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition from Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. to BMW for the first time. This brand-specific version of the arcade classic has been customized with exclusive BMW items, bringing a unique twist to one of the world’s best known games. AirConsole allows customers to use their smartphones as controllers so that all the passengers on board can play against each other.\n\nBMW Concept Speedtop: the sports Touring, redefined.\n\nAdding a particularly exclusive head-turner to the vehicles on display at the BMW Group’s Japan Mobility Show 2025 stand is the unique BMW Concept Speedtop. This three-door concept car was unveiled for the first time in May this year at the Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este 2025, the renowned celebration of historic vehicles on the shores of Lake Como in Italy. The BMW Concept Speedtop reimagines the sporty Touring model type, blending the elegance of a shooting brake with a fresh design language. The exclusivity of the BMW Concept Speedtop (which will be offered in a strictly limited-run small series of 70 cars) is underscored by its exquisite engine – the most powerful V8 engine currently offered by BMW.\n\nThe exterior of the BMW Concept Speedtop is marked out by the pronounced V-shape of the “shark-nose” front end, the slim front lights and the illuminated kidneys. The continuation of the central spline from the bonnet over the roof to the rear spoiler imbues the car with a dynamic Touring profile, its broad haunches further enriching the athletic design. And its elegance is underscored by two-tone, 14-spoke fan-style wheels, which have been designed specifically for the BMW Concept Speedtop. A two-tone colour and materials concept creates a connection between the exterior and interior. The sparkling brown tones of the Floating Sunstone Maroon exterior paint finish are carried over into the cabin in the form of the brown Sundown Maroon colour world with the light Moonstone White of the seats. In addition, skilfully crafted, traditional brogue-style details accentuate the leather-trimmed surfaces and visualise the manufactory-level craftsmanship on display. The boot of the BMW Concept Speedtop is also leather-covered and adorned with brogue-style perforations. The elaborate craftsmanship of the exterior and interior was realised with the expertise of the Manufactory workshop at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing.\n\nBMW X7 meets Japanese craftsmanship.\n\nThe BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge concept car presented at the Japan Mobility Show embodies the elegant symbiosis of luxurious driving comfort and traditional Japanese craftsmanship. With space for up to seven people, this attractive concept model based on the BMW X7 also offers high practicality. A tranquil space filled with beauty, where stars twinkle, the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge creates a gentle, expansive sanctuary. Here in the cabin, the refined brilliance of BMW's exclusive appointments is artistically combined with the vast expanse of a starry sky, crafted using traditional Kyoto techniques.\n\nA dedicated two-tone paint scheme instantly conveys the exclusive aura of the BMW X7 Nishiki Lounge. Complementing the main colour BMW Individual Velvet Blue, the roof section is painted in Space Silver to evoke the shimmer of nebulae shining in the cosmos. The Crystal Light Headlights emit an infinite, jewel-like brilliance, enhanced by gentle Iconic Glow light. The interior features a Panoramic Skyroof with 15,000 LEDs projecting a pale blue starlight at night, while the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System expresses the light shining on the earth through sound.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW iX3 50 xDrive: Energy consumption combined (WLTP): 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; CO2 emissions combined: (WLTP): 0 g/km; CO2 class: A BMW iX5 Hydrogen: As this is a development-phase prototype, energy consumption information according to WLTP is not available yet.

      "content": "London / Munich. Paul Smith and MINI – two traditional British brands have taken their partnership to the next level and created something great: The new MINI Paul Smith Edition. Following the MINI STRIP in 2021 and the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith in 2022, the British designer is now bringing his world-famous design language – ‘Classic with a twist’ – to the new MINI family. Whether electric or combustion engine, the edition will be available for all MINI Cooper 3-door, 5-door and Convertible models, with the exception of the John Cooper Works models. The look and details not only show Paul Smith’s signature style — but also the brands playful, optimistic and independent spirit. The MINI Paul Smith Edition celebrates its world premiere on October 29 at Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo.\n\n“It’s not often that you see two icons of British design work together in this way and it’s wonderful that our partnership has carried on over so many years. The MINI Paul Smith Edition has been a real privilege and a wonderful opportunity… new colours and new unexpected details that will be a welcomed surprise,” adds Sir Paul Smith, expressing his thoughts on the collaboration and the new design.\n\nUnmistakable look with a British twist.Combining MINI design with Paul Smith’s distinctive style: Exclusive exterior colours, sophisticated accents and unexpected details bring the shared history of MINI and Paul Smith into the present.\n\n\"MINI and Paul Smith embody a shared mindset of positivity, embracing the motto of this edition: 'Every day is a new beginning.' Our collaboration celebrates a mutual love for design and meticulous attention to detail. Unexpected elements, such as the 'hello' projection on the ground and Paul Smith’s handwritten inscription bring a smile to your face right upon entering the car,\" says Holger Hampf, Head of MINI Design.\n\nThe MINI Paul Smith Edition offers a choice of three exterior paint finishes, two of which are edition-exclusive: Statement Grey is a modern interpretation of the classic Mini Austin Seven colour from 1959 – a clear, bluish-tinted grey shade and self-confident statement of timeless modernity. Inspired White is a contemporary homage to the popular Classic Mini Beige colour, and finally the elegant and classic Midnight Black Metallic from the current MINI Family.\n\nRegardless of the body colour, the specially created Nottingham Green paintwork – a tribute to Sir Paul's hometown – adds sophisticated accents to the side mirrors, the octagonal radiator grille, the wheel hub covers with Paul Smith lettering and as the paintwork for one of the two roof variants.\n\nIn addition to the colour variants, numerous details characterise Paul Smith's signature and make the MINI Paul Smith Edition unmistakable: The ‘Signature Stripe’, a central design feature of the British designer, adorns the roof in Nottingham Green at the rear of the driver's side. The alternative version of the roof features elegant stripes in Jet Black in varying thickness, both matte and glossy. The MINI Cooper Convertible Paul Smith Edition is supplied with a black soft top.\n\nAll edition vehicles are equipped with 18-inch Night Flash Spoke black aluminium wheels with tinted clear coat in Dark Steel. The MINI logo at the front and rear is offered in newly designed Black Blue and complements the colour composition of Paul Smith and MINI. On the black horizontal handle strip at the rear, Paul Smith's signature refers to the creative spirit behind the vehicle design.\n\nBritish restraint and elegance in the interior.\n\nBritish character is also reflected in the interior with numerous components featuring a modern, elegant look. The knitted surfaces on the dashboard and door panels appear in black, while Paul Smith fabrics in tone-on-tone stripe patterns serve as inspiration for the special structure of the dashboard. The Nightshade Blue sports seats are made of Vescin and have knitted textile in the shoulder and headrest areas. Drawn from the Signature Stripe, the decorative stitching on the steering wheel's textile band is designed in bright colours - quintessentially Paul Smith.\n\nThe round display in the centre of the cockpit also appears with one of three different Paul Smith backgrounds when Personal Mode is selected. Small hidden details underline the British design influence - but also the playful character of the designer: when the door is opened, the driver and front passenger are greeted with a handwritten ‘Hello’ as a light projection on the floor and Smith's motto ‘Every day is a new beginning’ on the door sill, reflecting the positive mindset of both brands. A graphic of a stylized ‘rabbit’ hand-drawn by Paul Smith on the floor mat complete the interior details.\n\nA collaboration that blends British heritage, bold creativity and contemporary sophistication.MINI and Sir Paul Smith: two icons that are not only linked by their British heritage but also look back on exclusive collaborations resulting in unique styling. Their joint creative success story began in 1998, when the designer created a limited edition of the classic Mini: a specially created blue colour and matching anthracite-coloured alloy wheels lent the iconic model the signature of Paul Smith.\n\nTo mark the 40th birthday of the classic MINI in 1999, the fashion designer dipped an exclusive one-off in his characteristic stripe design, using 86 stripes in 26 colours.\n\nIn 2021, the MINI STRIP celebrated its world premiere: a vehicle designed using only what Paul Smith considered absolutely necessary. The result was a customised one-off car that despite its minimalist design and in keeping with Smith's guiding principle of ‘classic with a twist’, was not without unexpected and loving details.\n\nIn 2022, Paul Smith went back to the roots of the collaboration with the MINI Recharged by Paul Smith. A classic found its way into the now: a Classic Mini from the 1998 MINI Paul Smith Edition was transformed into a modernised electric vehicle. With a focus on quality and functionality, a contemporary vehicle was created that can also be seen as a tribute to the tradition and heritage of the classic MINI.\n\nPaul Smith MINI Collection But it is not only Sir Paul Smith who inspires MINI with creative ideas - the inspiration also works in reverse: the designer repeatedly uses MINI as a motif on exclusive pieces in his collections. To celebrate the launch of the MINI Paul Smith Edition, Paul Smith will release a capsule collection of bags inspired by details from the latest MINI collaboration.\n\nIn case of queries, please contact:\n\nCorporate Communications\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption combined: 14.7 - 14.1 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; Range in km according to WLTP: 385 - 400)."

      "content": "Björn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport:\n\n“In recent weeks, GT racing series around the world have been deciding their titles. Now it’s time to reap the rewards for the hard work put in throughout the season. Our BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers in North America have done this in an incredibly impressive fashion. A huge congratulations and sincere compliments to Random Vandals Racing, Turner Motorsport, and BimmerWorld Racing, who achieved a clean sweep in the SRO series with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO and BMW M4 GT4 EVO, winning all available titles. The record in the GT World Challenge America, GT America, and GT4 America is truly out of this world! I’m very sorry for BMW Italia Ceccato Racing that, despite an outstanding season, they just missed out on further titles. The final race was a bitter one. Nevertheless, the team and drivers once again proved what fantastic ambassadors they are for our brand in Italy.”\n\nItalian GT Championship (25.-26.10.): BMW Italia Ceccato Racing narrowly misses title hat-trick.\n\nBMW Italia Ceccato Racing and BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) narrowly missed out on their third consecutive title in the Italian GT Championship Sprint. Despite a victory and a third-place finish at the season finale at Monza (ITA), Klingmann and his works driver teammate Jesse Krohn (FIN) had to settle for second place overall. Driving the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, the duo claimed three wins and three additional podiums in eight races. After a dramatic finale, they fell just three points short of the championship lead. Klingmann and the team had won the Sprint title in the previous two seasons.\n\n“You can’t win the title every year, but I’m very proud of what we achieved as a team because we truly made the most of our opportunities,” said Klingmann. “With our victory in Saturday’s race, we were back in the title fight, but unfortunately, third place on Sunday wasn’t quite enough. I think we deserved it too, but this time Lamborghini had the upper hand. Congratulations to the crew of car #63. We’ll be back to fight again next year.” Krohn added: “Even though the end of the season feels bittersweet, I really enjoyed racing in Italy again. I think we gave everything we could in the title fight. Unfortunately, it just wasn’t enough. My overall season has been extremely positive – I’ve taken wins and podiums everywhere I raced, and above all, I won the 24h Nürburgring. I’m very happy with this year.”\n\nThe title race in the Pro-Am category also remained thrilling until the final event. William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) entered the last race as championship leaders but were forced to retire after an unavoidable collision with their #2 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, dropping to third in the final standings.\n\nThe Indianapolis 8 Hour just over a week ago was not only the season finale of the Intercontinental GT Challenge – where Team WRT triumphed and Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) secured the drivers’ title – it also marked the conclusion of the GT World Challenge America powered by AWS. BMW M Motorsport teams continued their incredible run of success there with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The title in the Pro category went to BMW M works driver Connor De Phillippi and his Random Vandals Racing teammate Kenton Koch (both USA). “I’m really proud to be part of this team,” said Koch. “Working with Connor all season has been amazing. We came in with things to learn, but we’ve shown incredible performances throughout the year. I’m proud of everyone and excited for what’s to come.” De Phillippi added: “It’s been an amazing effort from the entire team. I’m so proud of this group. This championship is my first with BMW, and that makes it even more meaningful. Hopefully it’s just the start of many more together.”\n\nIn the Pro-Am category, BMW M works driver Robby Foley and his young Turner Motorsport teammate Justin Rothberg (both USA) celebrated another title win, just like last year. “Justin has made incredible progress this season, he’s on a great trajectory,” said Foley. “Our second year working together has been awesome; we were faster, more consistent, and racked up more wins. Huge thanks to Turner Motorsport, Laticrete, all our partners, and every member of this incredible team.” Rothberg added: “The stars really aligned for us. Indy came through again. Robby and I are champions once more, and it feels fantastic.”\n\nThe celebrations among the BMW M Motorsport teams knew no bounds in both GT4 America and GT America. At the GT4 America Indianapolis (USA) season finale, all three class titles went to crews running the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. In the Silver class, Kenton Koch and Kevin Boehm (both USA) from Random Vandals Racing took the championship crown. Hats off to the whole Random Vandals Racing team this year. They've given us a rocketship every single race, I think we’ve consistently been one of the fastest BMWs this whole season,” said Boehm. “I think it just goes into the preparation that they do behind the scenes. What a day!” Koch pulled off the remarkable feat of winning championships with both BMW M Motorsport GT cars. Random Vandals Racing also dominated thePro-Am category, where Josh Green and Sam Craven (both USA) secured the title in the #94 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. “It’s been an amazing season for Josh and me,” said Craven. “It was our first time in SRO, and Random Vandals Racing did an incredible job. The whole team was just awesome, awesome, awesome!”\n\nIn the Am class, there was also no getting past the BMW M4 GT4 EVO. James Clay and Charlie Postins (both USA) from the BimmerWorld Racing team celebrated the championship victory. “I totally wanted it,” said Clay. “But I was reminded of patience that I rarely show, but I showed it today. That’s what you have to do to win the championship. It was a great battle. Thank you guys for all the memories made over the last four seasons.”\n\nIn GT America, Justin Rothberg completed his double title success with Turner Motorsport in the BMW M4 GT3 EVO, securing both championships for himself and the team. This brought team principal Will Turner’s squad their 11th and 12th titles in 28 years of racing – exclusively with BMW M Motorsport cars. “Coming into this race, I was hopeful that we’d win another championship, but walking away with two is surreal,” said Turner. “I knew the team could do it, and things just went our way. I’m super excited and ready to shoot for it again next year. Every championship that we’ve had over the years has been a little bit different, and they’re all special in different ways. Some are harder than others, and this one was certainly difficult, but the effort paid off.”"

      "content": "Munich/Parsdorf. With the publication of its Environmental Impact Statement 2024, all BMW Group operations in Parsdorf are now part of the European environmental register, EMAS. In addition to the BMW Group Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) and test-parts logistics, the pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf has been included in the environmental impact statement and EMAS registration for the first time. EMAS stands for the “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme”, which claims to be the most stringent environmental management system in the world. “We are very pleased with the EMAS registration of all our operations in Parsdorf, which underlines that our processes operate at a very high level – both economically and environmentally,” says Hansjörg Schilp, director of the CMCC and pilot plant for high-voltage batteries in Parsdorf. “The entire team has done an outstanding job.”\n\nEMAS: Strict requirements and high environmental standards\n\nTo be listed in the EMAS Register, companies must fulfil strict requirements and adhere to rigorous environmental standards. EMAS is a globally recognised framework that enables organisations to manage and continuously improve their environmental impact. A key element of the EMAS environmental management system is the international environmental management standard ISO 14001. EMAS also focuses on measurable improvements, transparency and legal certainty. Auditing aims to support companies in continuously improving their environmental performance – for example, by using energy and material more efficiently and reducing emissions, wastewater and waste from their sites. Beyond these direct environmental impacts, EMAS also addresses and evaluates indirect aspects, including the sustainability of products, procurement and supply chains, contractor practices and the environmental impact of employees commuting to work. (Source: https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/wirtschaft-konsum/wirtschaft-umwelt/umwelt-energiemanagement/emas-umweltmanagement-guetesiegel-der-europaeischen#systematisches-umweltmanagement-mit-emas)\n\nEfficient operations and concepts for the circular economy\n\nThe validated environmental impact statement and the resulting inclusion in the EMAS Register by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) for Munich and Upper Bavaria underscore the rigorous environmental standards upheld by the BMW Group in Parsdorf. Battery cell production at the CMCC, one of the three Parsdorf facilities, is powered entirely by electricity from 100% renewable energy sources. Hot water for process ventilation is generated using waste heat recovered from various primary processes, and all three Parsdorf facilities utilise heat pumps in their operations. “On our pilot lines for battery cells and high-voltage batteries, we are focusing on reducing the use of critical raw materials and energy, avoiding solvents and developing innovative circular economy approaches,” explains Schilp. Raw materials represent a significant cost factor for battery cells and high-voltage batteries. Efficient and responsible use of these resources is therefore necessary and also makes economic sense. The BMW Group is gaining valuable insights in this area in Parsdorf. Residual materials from the production process are collected and, wherever technically feasible, reintegrated into the value-creation cycle at the BMW Group’s Competence Centres through direct recycling. This innovative procedure enables residual materials from battery cell production, as well as whole battery cells, to be mechanically dismantled into their components.\n\nTransparent reporting: Environmental impact statement now online\n\nThe environmental impact statement for the BMW Group’s Parsdorf operations (CMCC, pilot plant for high-voltage batteries and test-parts logistics) has been independently reviewed by TÜV SÜD Umweltgutachter GmbH and is now available online at: www.bmwgroup-werke.com/produktionskompetenz/de.html\n\nHow the cell is created: Production steps for sample manufacturing at the CMCC\n\nCell manufacturing at the CMCC in Parsdorf begins with electrode production: Here, the base material, comprising, for example, graphite for the anode and nickel oxides for the cathode, with binders and solvents, is metered and mixed in a precisely measured ratio. This creates the so-called “slurry” – which means wafer-thin metal foils are coated and then compressed after drying. In technical jargon, this is referred to as “calendering”. The highest level of precision is required: The foil is just a few micrometres thick – in other words, thinner than the threads of a spider web – while the coating is in the micrometre range. During cell assembly, the coated foils, referred to in the jargon as calendered electrodes, are coiled into so-called “jelly rolls” using the separator and inserted into the cell housing. The cells are filled with electrolyte, then charged for the first time and finally checked for functionality and quality.\n\nParsdorf pioneers: How the BMW Group builds Gen6 high-voltage batteries\n\nParsdorf is also home to the BMW Group’s largest pilot plant for Gen6 high-voltage batteries, where production processes are developed and tested before large-scale production begins at the series plants in Debrecen (Hungary), Irlbach-Straßkirchen (Lower Bavaria), Shenyang (China), San Luis Potosí (Mexico) and Woodruff (USA). More than 350 employees have been building initial high-voltage battery prototypes here since 2023. In the meantime, these batteries have also been delivered to the vehicle plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where they were installed in test vehicles for the Neue Klasse. For series production, the BMW Group sources battery cells for its high-voltage batteries from leading cell manufacturers, who produce the cells to the company's specifications. The highest technical standards apply. Upon receipt of goods, additional measurements – such as voltage checks – are carried out. Next comes cell clustering, where the battery cells are connected to coolers. This step ensures optimal insulation and cooling of the cells. The cell clusters and cell contact system are then laser-cleaned and welded with pinpoint precision. The in-line inspection continuously monitors each weld seam in real time. An innovative foaming process follows, ensuring that all elements are protected as a mechanical unit. The foam thus guarantees the safety, stability and durability of the high-voltage battery. The housing is then closed, sealed and riveted. In the final assembly step, the Energy Master – the central control unit – is installed onto the high-voltage battery. A permanently elastic sealing adhesive is applied to ensure a reliable seal. Finally, each high-voltage battery undergoes a 100% end-of-line inspection to ensure quality, safety and function."

      "content": "Luxembourg / Munich. The BMW Group is using its presence at the \"Fleet Europe Days\" on 22 and 23 October in Luxembourg to show fleet operators ways to decarbonise their fleets. In addition to fully electrified vehicles, the focus will be on fuels based on renewable raw materials, so-called Carbon Neutral Fuels (CNF).\n\nTheir advantage: the potential to save CO2. With more than 250 million existing vehicles in Europe, their CO2 footprint can be improved if the proportion of renewable fuels is increased. A new technical solution used by the BMW Group is proof that all BMW diesels in a fleet are fuelled exclusively with HVO100. Refuelling data from the vehicle is compared with data from the fleet operator's payment system. This means that the fuel used by the vehicle can be traced seamlessly. An important step towards a \"CNF only-fleet\" for fleet customers. Dr. Martin Kaufmann, Head of Powertrain Development at the BMW Group: \"Our goal is always to have more environmentally friendly and efficient vehicles on the road. With the diesel replacement fuel HVO100, we have an opportunity to reduce the CO2 footprint of vehicle fleets. Especially in the area of fuels that are not based on fossil fuels, we see a potential that we are ready to realise.”\n\nBernhard Kuhnt, Head of Sales Region Europe, BMW Group: \"Fleet customers are extremely important for sales in Europe and at the same time diesel remains a very good powertrain technology for many fleets.\n\nInitial contractual agreements with the operators of large BMW diesel fleets in Germany and Italy are imminent. These test fleets, together with the internal BMW Group fleet that has already been launched, will provide important data and findings for the further improvement of the technical solution. HVO100 used in the first fuelling of all diesel produced in Germany\n\nSince January 2025, all diesel models produced in Germany are being fuelled with HVO100 before delivery to dealers. This step underlines BMW's commitment to making decarbonisation possible and achievable today. The abbreviation HVO stands for 'Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil' and the suffix '100' indicates that it is filled with 100 per cent pure fuel.\n\n\"Neste MY Renewable Diesel™\" HVO100 is used at the BMW Group plants in Munich, Dingolfing, Regensburg and Leipzig.\n\nThe fuel from Finnish manufacturer Neste enables a CO2e reduction of up to 90 per cent (\"well to wheel\") compared to fossil diesel. The initial filling at the plants before delivery to the BMW Group dealer organisation is five to eight litres, depending on the model. For the BMW Group, technological openness is a top priority. \"Options instead of bans\" is its motto. The company continues to invest in a broad portfolio - from battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cells to highly efficient combustion engines that can run on renewable fuels.\n\nThe BMW Group has long approved its vehicles for a variety of regenerative fuels: HVO according to EN15940 as well as B10 and eFuels according to EN590 for diesel engines. In addition, E20/25 and eFuels according to EN228 for petrol engines.

Munich's Olympic Park was the venue last weekend for the premiere of the LOOP ONE Festival, where the biathlon elite kicked off the new season. Before the competitions began on Sunday in the BMW Welt, the German National Team delighted fans on Saturday afternoon with an appearance on the main stage at the Olympic Stadium. Selina Grotian, Janina Hettich-Walz, Franziska Preuß, Vanessa Voigt, Johannes Kühn, Philipp Nawrath, Danilo Riethmüller, and Justus Strelow received symbolic licence plates with their names and the BMW model they had chosen for the new season. BMW is the Mobility Partner of the DSV Biathlon and a Partner of the LOOP ONE Festival.\n\n“We promise the German team a relaxed journey on the 'Road to Gold' with the new BMW vehicles. I am confident that the cars have enough space for some precious metal,” said Christian Ach, Head of BMW Germany, during the vehicle handover. “BMW and all its employees wish you great success for this weekend, the entire season, and safe travels at all times.”\n\nThe biathletes then took time for their fans, signing autographs before seizing a special photo opportunity. A new, fully electric BMW iX3, the first vehicle of the Neue Klasse, was displayed inside an oversized snow globe. The national team clearly enjoyed the moment.\n\nThe competitions on Sunday started at the BMW Welt. The new BMW iX3 served as the lead vehicle for the first part of the course. During the super sprint on roller skis, the final consisted of five laps of 1.8 kilometres each, with two shooting rounds in both standing and prone positions. In front of approximately 50,000 spectators, Eric Perrot from France won the men's competition.

      "content": "Jerez de la Frontera. Mission title defense accomplished: Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR) is once again the World Champion in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) for 2025! With third place in the second main race of the dramatic season finale in Jerez de la Frontera (ESP), ‘El Turco’ secured the crown. This marks his second consecutive World Championship title as a BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory rider with the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team – and the third WorldSBK title of his career (2021, 2024, 2025).\n\nAfter his outstanding championship win in 2024, Razgatlioglu entered the 2025 season as the clear favourite. However, following a winter testing phase during which the BMW M 1000 RR had to be adapted at short notice due to regulation changes, the season started off more challenging than expected. Despite scoring a hat-trick at the second round in Portimão (POR), there were also setbacks, and Razgatlioglu found himself in the role of the chaser behind Ducati rider Nicolò Bulega (ITA).\n\nBut by mid-season in June, ‘El Turco’, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team turned the tide. In Misano (ITA), Donington Park (GBR), the new Balaton Park Circuit (HUN), and Magny-Cours (FRA), he won every race – achieving four consecutive hat-tricks and taking the championship lead. He then celebrated his first-ever victory at MotorLand Aragón (ESP), equaling his own record from 2024 of 13 consecutive wins. After further victories and podium finishes, he ultimately secured the 2025 title with 616 points – 13 points ahead of Bulega.\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) wrapped up his final weekend as a WorldSBK rider with more strong Top 10 finishes. After five years with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (2021–2025), he will remain part of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family. Already on Tuesday in Jerez de la Frontera, he will be back on the BMW M 1000 RR, working with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Test Team to prepare for the 2026 WorldSBK season.\n\nReactions after the season finale.\n\nMarkus Flasch, CEO of BMW Motorrad: “Congratulations to Toprak and the entire team! This season, everyone has shown what true champions are made of. The first races weren’t easy, but for everyone – especially for Toprak – the attitude was clear: stand up, straighten your crown, and keep going. And what a way they kept going! The winning streak that began in Misano was simply breathtaking. Even on the nerve-racking final Sunday here in Jerez, after the unfortunate retirement in the Superpole Race through no fault of his own, everyone stayed completely focused and prepared everything perfectly so that Toprak could seal the deal in race two. The reward is Toprak’s well-deserved second World Championship title on our BMW M 1000 RR. We are incredibly proud of him and of everyone in the team, in Munich and Berlin, whose hard work made this achievement possible.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am very happy and smiling. To get the title was very important for me. This was my last year with BMW and in the Superbike Paddock. It is a great gift to BMW before I leave for MotoGP. In the end we are World Champions. At the beginning of the season, we were not so strong but we improved with every race. Thanks to the entire team and BMW for all this hard work. It is not me being the World Champion, it is us. Looking back onto this final weekend: Everything went very well yesterday especially and today I came to the track more relaxed. I just needed to finish the Superpole Race within the top seven but we crashed in turn five. I know this is racing and everybody wants to pass. It is that he (Nicolò Bulega) just hit me and I crashed. After that I just stayed calm and focused on race two because I needed to do a good job there. I just focused on achieving the best possible position. I started the race not pushing too hard but I worked my way to the front step by step and in the end, we were on the podium. To be World Champion again is a great feeling and I want to thank everyone who was part of this journey.”\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I am very happy – and speechless. It is such a great day. I think that after the Superpole Race, we all aged by ten years. The job the team did was amazing. The bike was pretty damaged and to work under that pressure to get it ready for race two was incredible. Everybody stayed calm, and I think this was in the end the key for us to win the title. The second title in a row – we are happy for Toprak, for the team, for BMW Motorrad. Toprak wrote history for BMW. It was wild ride together and we are sad that it’s over but we will cheer for him next year. And we are also so thankful for everything that Mickey has done for us. We had difficult years, also with injuries but he was always loyal to us. And he has played an important part in winning these two title in both years. We are really looking forward to continue working with him. What we are going to do, we will announce soon. But for now – we are going to have a big party tonight, and from tomorrow on we fully focus on the 2026 WorldSBK season with Danilo Petrucci and Miguel Oliveira.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “I can‘t describe how I feel because it was an incredible day. A few hours with a lot of emotions, ups and downs, everything happened. But at the end for sure to see Toprak back on the podium, celebrating the second world championship for us, for BMW, makes me very proud and the whole project, the whole team, everybody involved. So it’s a fantastic day to complete a fantastic. At the end the key for any success in sport is always focus and teamwork. We listened to the riders, we looked into our package and tried to be focused to learn from the situation when we were not fast enough to beat our competitors. And with the focus of the riders, of the crew and all our technicians in Munich, we managed to turn the page. Thank you to Toprak, who is an incredible person on and off the track, thank you to Mickey, who did so much for us since he joined in 2021, and thank you to the entire team! A very personal thank-you also goes to my wife Katharina and my kids, who are always a source of support for me.”\n\nShaun Muir, Team Principal ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “My feelings are really tough to put into words. We woke up feeling super, super positive, but as we always know anything can happen in racing and it actually did in the sprint race. I’ve just got to put my hands together and praise the good work the guys did. The entire team stayed focused. In the end Toprak is a three-times World Champion, and two times with BMW. I am absolutely over the moon, proud as you can be, of everyone involved and the lot of hard work everybody did.\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a nice weekend. I have for sure some mixed feelings about my races, especially race two I didn’t enjoy as much as I wish I did. But you know it’s racing and I think after today we have a lot of things to be happy about with the team. It has been a strange season. The start of the season was a bit weird with the last minute changes in regulations and stuff like that. Especially my side, I struggled quite a lot with the bike honestly. Also at one point, mentally it was difficult and I just could not find any progress. That has been tough. But we always kept working, the team always kept working and I think towards the end of the year I did the Suzuka 8 Hours, got my confidence back and then when I came back I had the speed again and I felt more confident with the bike. I think Toprak showed again how special he is and he so deserves the title. He and the entire team deserve the title. Time went fast, and I enjoyed my time in WorldSBK. I have six wins here and podiums. Now I have exactly one day off and on Tuesday I will start with the test team to improve the package for next year for Danilo and Miguel.”\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 21°, humidity: 59%, conditions: dry.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nELF Marc VDS Racing Team\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 29°, track temperature: 30°, humidity: 41%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 2, 1:38.737\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 21°, humidity: 60%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nBimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 2, 1:37.659 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 27°, track temperature: 30°, humidity: 49%, conditions: dry, laps: 20.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 3, 1:38.693\n\nFinal riders’ classification (R12/12, after 36 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFinal manufacturers’ classification (R12/12, after 36 of 36 races)."

      "content": "Indianapolis. Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) was crowned Drivers’ Champion of the Intercontinental GT Challenge at the season finale. The South African took victory in a chaotic Indianapolis 8 Hour (USA) alongside Charles Weerts (BEL) and Valentino Rossi (ITA) in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO fielded by Team WRT. Their teammates Raffaele Marciello (ITA), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA) completed the double podium by finishing third in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO. With that, BMW clinched its first-ever Manufacturers’ Championship title in the IGTC. The “Battle on the Bricks” was initially halted for a long time due to a thunderstorm with heavy rain and eventually finished behind the safety car.\n\nFrom the start of the weekend, the BMW M4 GT3 EVO showed strong pace on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. All five BMW cars made it into the Pole Shootout. Philipp Eng (AUT) set the fastest time there in the #51 Random Vandals Racing entry – but the team was stripped of pole position after the car was found to be slightly under the minimum weight. This promoted the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Team WRT to start from second place, directly ahead of its sister car, the #46.\n\nIn the race, the strong performance from qualifying continued as all BMW M4 GT3 EVOs impressed from the start. After three and a half hours, the four Pro entries occupied positions two through five when the title contenders took over driving duties for the first time: Marciello in the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO in second place, directly ahead of van der Linde in third. With two spectacular overtakes, the WRT duo soon took over the lead and established a 1–2 formation – before a thunderstorm moved over the circuit and brought out a red flag for more than two hours.\n\nAround 90 minutes before the end of the clock, the Indianapolis 8 Hour resumed behind the safety car in heavy rain. Pit stops shuffled the order, putting van der Linde in the lead in the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, while the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO with Marciello at the wheel lost two positions due to a later stop. The race was briefly restarted but soon ended again behind the safety car – with the #46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO leading the field to the finish. Thus, Team WRT celebrated its third consecutive victory at the Indianapolis 8 Hour, following wins in 2023 and 2024.\n\nWith its fourth win in five races this season, BMW also claimed the IGTC Manufacturers’ Championship for the first time, while van der Linde secured the Drivers’ Title. Earlier in the season, BMW M Motorsport and van der Linde had already triumphed at the Bathurst 12 Hour, the Nürburgring 24 Hours, and the Suzuka 1000KM. Just the previous Sunday, the South African and Weerts had also won the overall title in the GT World Challenge Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, bad luck struck the #51 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Eng, Bill Auberlen, and Varun Choksey (both USA). After a brilliant opening stint from tenth on the grid, the Random Vandals Racing car even led the race at one stage. However, a technical issue with the engine cost the team significant time in the pits, and they eventually retired after the red flag. Their teammates Connor De Phillippi, Conor Daly, and Kenton Koch (all USA) delivered a strong performance in the #99 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, finishing fourth overall. That result also secured De Phillippi and Koch the Drivers’ Title in the GT World Challenge America.\n\nTurner Motorsport celebrated third place in the Pro-Am category with the #29 BMW M4 GT3 EVO driven by BMW M works driver Robby Foley alongside Patrick Gallagher and Justin Rothberg (USA). With that result, Foley and Rothberg also claimed the overall Pro-Am Championship title.\n\nQuotes after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What an impressive season in the Intercontinental GT Challenge! Four wins out of five races underline the remarkable consistency of our teams and drivers. Congratulations to Team WRT for their third consecutive victory at the Indianapolis 8 Hour. I am absolutely delighted that we were able to secure the Manufacturers’ title in the series for the first time. Congratulations also to Kelvin van der Linde on the Drivers’ Championship – even though Raffaele Marciello would have deserved it just as much. My compliments also go to Turner Motorsport and Robby Foley for their Pro-Am title, as well as to Random Vandals Racing, Connor De Phillippi, and Kenton Koch for their GTWC America crown. Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to all the teams who contributed to these outstanding achievements.”\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, WRT): “It’s a great way to finish the Intercontinental GT Championship with a win in Indianapolis – our third in a row. Unfortunately, we made a mistake with the #777 by not calling them in at the right time. I feel very sorry for Lello, but that’s racing. Still, I’m very happy that we were able to bring this trophy home to BMW, and of course I’m very happy for Kelvin. The team did a fantastic job – having two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs on the podium is a great result. Thanks to the SRO for this championship; they did an excellent job this year.”\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Drivers’ Champion): “The #777 deserved the win – they were stronger the whole weekend. But sometimes you just have bad luck in racing. Unfortunately, the weather decided the race today. Apart from that, four wins in five races make this an extraordinary year for BMW M Motorsport and Team WRT. We need to enjoy and celebrate that – it doesn’t happen every year. I’m very proud to have contributed a small piece of history in my first year with BMW M Motorsport.”\n\nCharles Weerts (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Winner): “I’m obviously very happy for BMW M Motorsport to secure the championship in Indianapolis. It was a bizarre race with the thunderstorm and the rain, which unfortunately prevented us from really racing for most of the event. The #777 was very strong the whole weekend and was ahead of us at the time of the red flag – they definitely deserved the win today. But the most important thing is that BMW won.”\n\nValentino Rossi (#46 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Winner): “I’m really happy – it was a great weekend. These kinds of races are the ones I really enjoy, and I also learn a lot from them. I think I did a good job in the first two hours. The #777 had great pace but was very unlucky. Overall, I’m very happy with the weekend and my performance because I really enjoyed it.”\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, 3rd place): “We had a lot of fun together as teammates. There’s just a great atmosphere within BMW. The race itself hurts a bit. The main goal was to secure the championship for BMW – and we did that, which makes me very happy. We won many races this season, and I’m very happy for Kelvin; he deserves it. But of course it hurts, and we’ll try again next year.”\n\nPhilipp Eng (#51 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Random Vandals Racing, DNF): “It was great to race with Random Vandals Racing. The team is fantastic, and the car was perfectly prepared. We were competitive from the very start of the weekend. The Superpole went perfectly – the car was great, and I managed a strong lap. The first stint was a lot of fun; fighting my way through the field from tenth after the penalty was great. Unfortunately, we had to retire because we lost too many laps due to a technical issue. But for me, it was a great experience racing with this team, and I’d love to come back.”\n\nRobby Foley (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Turner Motorsport, 3rd place Pro-Am): “It was a crazy race with the weather, but we had the clear goal of winning the title. Our competitors dropped out early, so we had to be smart, sensible, and mistake-free – and in the end, we came home third. It was a great season with Justin; he’s improved so much in just one year. To be back-to-back Pro-Am Champions is something very special. A huge thank you to Turner Motorsport and BMW M Motorsport for all the support.”\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#99 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Random Vandals Racing, 4th place): “I’m very happy about the GT World Challenge America title. It’s my first championship since joining BMW M Motorsport. Kenton and the team did a fantastic job. It would have been nice to fight for the win here, but we had to secure our championship points. Still, it was a good day, a great year, and I’m already looking forward to 2026.”"

      "content": "Munich/Paris. On the occasion of this new edition of Paris Photo at the Grand Palais, BMW France unveils the exhibition “Crossing the Missing Fragment”, by artist Raphaëlle Peria and curator Fanny Robin, the duo laureates of the BMW ART MAKERS mentoring programme.\n\nA partnership backed by a shared vision for the future of culture.For more than 50 years, BMW has affirmed its lasting commitment to culture, convinced that artists are trailblazers who can anticipate and reveal the major issues of their era. Supporting creation means supporting those who shape tomorrow’s perspectives.\n\nFor 23 years, this role has been notably expressed through this partnership with Paris Photo. By supporting the international photographic and artistic scene, BMW provides decisive visibility to emerging talents. Many artists supported by the programme have since achieved major recognition, confirming the strength and relevance of this commitment.\n\nThis ongoing dialogue between artistic innovation, society, and business reflects a shared desire: to embed culture for the long term and make it accessible to all, both today and for future generations.\n\n“Together, we make culture shine today and for future generations, by valuing its longevity in a world where everything speeds up,” says Vincent Salimon, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW Group France.\n\n“Crossing the Missing Fragment” reinvented for Paris Photo.“Trees are living beings that carry our memory; they are the guardians of our secrets.” Raphaëlle Peria.\n\nThe second part of the exhibition, created by the duo laureates of the BMW ART MAKERS programme, is presented in November under the Grand Palais’s dome in Paris. First unveiled this summer at the 56th edition of the Rencontres d’Arles, at the Cloître Saint-Trophime, the exhibition has been reinvented for Paris Photo and enriched with approximately ten new works. For the occasion, the set design has been entirely rethought and specially conceived to enhance this new chapter.\n\nFanny Robin, the curator, thus presents the project as follows: “Embarking on the journey at the heart of the exhibition Crossing the Missing Fragment is to retrace the thread of water and time. Through this project, Raphaëlle Peria offers us an intimate archaeology of the image, where personal memory engages in dialogue with the universal.\n\nAfter its initial presentation at the Rencontres d’Arles, this second part of the exhibition conceived for Paris Photo is unveiled as an even more immersive traverse of the landscape. With a renewed scenography designed as a space of resonance that interacts transparently with the Grand Palais’s glass roof, the exhibition takes on a decidedly different form. A series of new works, created specifically for the occasion, subtly resonates with the venue’s architecture .\n\nAt the pinnacle of this installation, a copper wallpaper with ardent reflections envelops the space like a fresco-palimpsest, blurring the lines between archival images and representations of a present environment. Through this revised approach, new sensitive strata unfold within the space, bearing witness to the uniqueness of Raphaëlle Peria’s gaze and singular gesture.\n\nThe project begins with the discovery of an exhumed photo album, a relic from a childhood journey aboard a barge, initiating this new creation. Family archives, long buried, revive fragmentary memories and become the foundation of an exploration where memories confront the evolution of the landscape. Thirty years later, Raphaëlle Peria returns to the places once crossed. She finds a nature in peril: the plane trees along the Canal du Midi, rotting from within due to the colored canker, now embody a slow disappearance. Confronted with this silent erosion, the artist tirelessly scratches the surface of images, revealing through subtraction the imprint of passing time. With complete transparency, she translates the fragility of life through the very material of photography.”\n\nThe BMW ART MAKERS programme brings together and supports an emerging visual artist and a curator in the creation of a collaborative artistic project.\n\nThe laureate duo, composed of an artist and a curator, receives a grant of 33,000 euros which covers the scholarship as well as the research and production budget for the works. The project is presented each year at the Rencontres d'Arles and then at Paris Photo, of which BMW is an official partner.\n\nPractical informationExhibition “Crossing the Missing Fragment”by Raphaëlle Peria and Fanny RobinParis Photo - Stand C01 Grand Palaisfrom November 13 to 16, 2025\n\nBiographies of the BMW ART MAKERS 2025 Laureates.\n\nRaphaëlle Peria, Artist Graduated in 2014 from the École Européenne Supérieure d’Art de Bretagne.

The 2025 BMW Ladies Championship got off to a perfect start at its new venue, Pine Beach Golf Links near Gwangju in southwest South Korea. During the first round, Lucy Li (USA) sunk a hole-in-one on the 13th hole (par 3). For her spectacular shot from a distance of 155 yards with a 7-iron, the American golfer was rewarded with an all-electric BMW i7 eDrive50. The 23-year-old, currently ranked 97th in the world, has been playing on the LPGA Tour since 2023 but has yet to secure a tournament victory. With today’s hole-in-one, Li joins the illustrious group of players who have earned themselves sheer driving pleasure at BMW professional tournaments around the globe.\n\nThe hole-in-one helped Li achieve an opening round of 68 strokes (4 under par), placing her in a tie for 22nd. Leading the 78-player field at their home event are two South Korean golfers: Sei Young Kim (62, -10) is in first place, followed by Hyo Joo Kim (63, -9). Since there is no cut at the BMW Ladies Championship, all players still have three rounds to follow in Li’s footsteps and claim one of the two remaining Hole-in-One Awards at the only LPGA Tour stop in South Korea. Tournament organiser BMW Korea will reward the first hole-in-one on the 8th hole with a MINI John Cooper Works Countryman ALL4, while the all-electric premium SAV BMW iX awaits a new owner on the 15th hole.\n\nLi is the fourth player to earn a Hole-in-One Award in the history of the BMW Ladies Championship. The first to do so was Kristen Gillman during the inaugural event in 2019. At LPGA International Busan, the 13 (par 3) also proved to be her lucky number. From a distance of 179 yards, Gillman holed out with a 4-hybrid, marking the first ace of her professional career and winning a BMW 740Li XDrive.\n\nThree years later, something unparalleled happened at the Oak Valley Country Club. The BMW Group has been involved in international professional golf since 1989, but what occurred at the 2022 BMW Ladies Championship had never been seen before when two Hole-in-One Awards were won on the same day. During round three of the BMW Ladies Championship, South Korean Na Yeon Choi was rewarded for her dream shot on the 12th hole with a BMW X7 xDrive40i. A short while later, cheers rang round the course again, as Thailand’s Ariya Jutanugarn aced the 17th to win a BMW 740i.\n\nSince that ‘Super-Saturday’ in October 2022, no other BMW professional tournament around the world has seen such a spectacular double. The BMW Ladies Championship 2025 offers the chance to make golf history once again this week.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW i7 M70 xDrive: WLTP energy consumption combined: 23.7 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 490-559 km MINI JCW Countryman ALL4: WLTP energy consumption combined: 8.2 l/100 km; WLTP CO2 emissions combined: 186 g/km; CO2-class: BMW iX xDrive45: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17.8 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO2-class: A; WLTP electric range: 602 km"

We’re looking forward to an exciting weekend and special moments at BMW Welt, to which we warmly invite all fans.”\n\nOn Saturday at 2pm, the German Biathlon National Team will present itself on the main stage between the Olympic Stadium and Olympic Hall.

Visitors should also check out the BMW and MINI theme worlds on the peninsula near the Olympic Tower, featuring attractive vehicles and activities such as the BMW Touch & Charge Wall and the BMW Pit Stop Challenge.

In addition to the German stars, reigning overall World Cup champion Sturla Holm Laegreid (NOR) and world champions Lou Jeanmonnot (FRA) and Lisa Vittozzi (ITA) will also be in action."

      "content": "Björn Lellmann, Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport:\n\n\"Congratulations to FK Performance Motorsport, Nick Wüstenhagen, and Ranko Mijatovic on winning the overall standings in the NLS! This marks the first time a team with the BMW M4 GT4 has finished a Nürburgring season on top. I am very proud of this achievement, as it not only highlights the outstanding performance of the team and drivers but also underlines the strong and highly competitive nature of the GT4 classes in the NLS. Our customer racing car regularly plays a leading role in the 'Green Hell' and delivers spectacular racing. I also want to congratulate all other winners and champions who compete with our cars in the NLS. Beyond that, our ambassadors around the world have celebrated further successes – whether in the GT4 European Series in Spain, the IMSA series in the USA, the Italian GT, or in Hungary at the GT Cup Series. Our customers are giving us plenty of reasons to celebrate as the season comes to a close, and I am very happy about that.\"\n\nNLS 9 & 10 (27.9./11.10.): FK Performance Motorsport celebrates overall title with the BMW M4 GT4.\n\nThe new Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) champions are FK Performance Motorsport, Nick Wüstenhagen (GER), and Ranko Mijatovic (SUI). With an incredible streak of nine class victories in ten races, they secured the overall title in the 2025 Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) with the #187 BMW M4 GT4. Alongside their rotating co-drivers, Wüstenhagen and Mijatovic dominated the SP8T class. This marks not only FK Performance Motorsport’s first NLS overall title but also the first for the BMW M4 GT4. \"We’ve been competing in the NLS as FK Performance since 2013, and it makes us very proud to now be crowned champions. This was definitely not an unlucky 13th year for us; it’s one of our greatest achievements,\" said team principal Martin Kaemena.\n\nThe Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels, which had won the championship for the past seven years, finished the 2025 season in fifth place overall with drivers Philipp Leisen, Philipp Stahlschmidt, and Daniel Zils (all GER) in the #500 BMW 330i. However, the trio claimed the Production Car Trophy. The first-ever champion of the newly introduced BMW 325i Challenge is Moran Gott from Adrenalin Motorsport Team Mainhattan Wheels. The Israeli driver secured nine victories, six of them as a solo competitor. In the BMW M240i class, Sven Markert and Kevin Wambach (both GER) triumphed, earning the team its third title of the season with a BMW race car.\n\nIn the final two races of the 2025 NLS season, NLS 9 and NLS 10, BMW teams achieved a total of 12 class victories with various BMW race cars.\n\nGT4 European Series (10.-12.10.): Besler and Piana celebrate double podium in Barcelona.\n\nBMW M Racing Academy participant Berkay Besler (TUR) concluded the GT4 European Series alongside Gabriele Piana (ITA) with a double podium finish. The duo from Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport finished second in the Silver Class on Saturday at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya (ESP) after an intense battle for the lead. In Sunday’s season finale, Besler and Piana secured third place in the #12 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. With one victory at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) and six podium finishes in 12 races, they ended the season in a strong third place in the Silver Class. Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport also claimed second place in the team standings for the category. “It was a good weekend. Both drivers had strong qualifying sessions, and we ran two clean races. Gabriele and the entire team did a fantastic job throughout the season. I’m very happy with our performance this year. Six podiums in 12 races show how competitive we were. I’m already looking forward to next season,” said Besler.\n\nThe season finale was less fortunate for Jean-Mathieu Leandri and Antoni de Barn (both FRA) from CHAZEL Technologie Course. After five wins in the AM category during the first ten races, they arrived in Catalonia with title hopes. However, a collision in Saturday’s race left them without points for the first time this season, and they ultimately finished second in the overall standings.\n\nIMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge (10.-12.10.): Podium finish for the BMW M4 GT4 EVO.\n\nAt the season finale of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge in Road Atlanta (USA), Turner Motorsport secured a podium finish with the #96 BMW M4 GT4 EVO. BMW M works driver Robby Foley (USA) partnered with Beltre Curtis (USA), who made his series debut. Starting from 13th, Curtis delivered a strong stint before handing over to Foley, who secured third place. Two other BMW M4 GT4 EVO cars finished fourth and fifth. Sean McAlister and Jeff Westphal (both USA) from CarBahn with Peregrine Racing finished fourth, narrowly missing out on the drivers’ title and ending the season second in the standings.\n\nVP Racing SportsCar Challenge (10.-12.10.): Two wins for Walker, Bronze Cup title for Tan.\n\nTurner Motorsport driver Jake Walker (USA) won both final races of the GSX class in the IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge at Road Atlanta (USA), finishing the season second in the drivers’ standings with the #6 BMW M4 GT3. Walker impressed with six consecutive wins and nine victories overall during the season. Despite scoring no points in the first two events of the year, he managed to secure second place overall. Samantha Tan (CAN) claimed the Bronze Cup title with two third-place finishes, which also counted as class victories, in the #38 BMW M4 GT3.\n\nItalian GT Championship (26.-28.9.): Podium for Klingmann and Krohn at Imola.\n\nBMW M works drivers Jens Klingmann (GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) celebrated another podium finish in the Italian GT Championship. At the penultimate sprint weekend of the series at Imola (ITA), the duo finished third overall in Sunday’s race with the #1 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from BMW Italia Ceccato Racing. On Saturday, they finished seventh overall and fourth in the GT3-Pro class. Their teammates William Alatalo (FIN) and Leonardo Caglioni (ITA) also had reason to celebrate, finishing second and third in the GT3-Pro-Am class with the #2 car. The season finale will take place at the end of October at Monza (ITA), where BMW Italia Ceccato Racing aims to defend last year’s title.\n\nGT Cup Series (26.-28.9.): Successful season ends with titles and wins.\n\nThe newly opened Balaton Park Circuit in Hungary hosted the season finale of the GT Cup Series. Šenkýř Motorsport represented BMW M with the BMW M4 GT4 and was unbeatable. Matyas Faiereisl (CZE) won the GT4 class in both sprint races and the endurance race with the #9 BMW M4 GT4.\n\nIn the GT3 classes, the champions were already decided before the finale, and they also drove the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. The 2025 GT3-Sprint champion is Rudolf Beňo (SVK) from Team Aries Racing. In the GT3-Endurance class, Gregor Szigo (SVK) and Dennis Waszek (CZE) from Racing Trevor claimed the championship. Beňo and his teammate Richard Gonda (SVK) finished second in the endurance standings.\n\nBTCC (3.-5.10.): Jake Hill ends season on the podium.\n\nJake Hill (GBR) concluded the 2025 British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) season with another podium finish. At the finale in Brands Hatch (GBR), Hill drove the #1 BMW 330i M Sport from Team Laser Tools Racing with MB Motorsport to third place in the final race of the weekend. Hill finished the season, which had its ups and downs, fourth in the drivers’ standings."

      "content": "Munich. The spectacular street race on the Guia Circuit in Macau (CHN) is just around the corner, and BMW M Motorsport will compete on 15th/16th November with two high-profile BMW M4 GT3 EVO entries. Raffaele Marciello (SUI) will race for ROWE Racing in a car featuring a newly developed livery. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Team WRT, as in the previous year, will take to the track in a car sporting the special design of BMW M Motorsport Premium Technology Partner Shell.\n\nIn 2024, Marciello celebrated victory in the qualification race during his Macau debut as a BMW M works driver. However, in the rain-affected main race, he retired while battling for the win. Marciello has earned his reputation as a Macau specialist through his triumphs in 2019 and 2023. This year, his BMW M4 GT3 EVO will be fielded by ROWE Racing. The new identity design debuts a revised colour scheme, replacing the previous white, yellow, and grey with white, red, and black.\n\nVan der Linde also competed in 2024 with a special Shell livery – and it brought him luck. In his second Macau appearance, he secured his first podium finish by taking third place in the main race. He now aims to improve on this record during his third outing in Macau, once again teaming up with WRT.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"After the bitter main race last year, we still have unfinished business with the FIA GT World Cup. Our BMW M4 GT3 was very strong on the Guia Circuit in 2024 but missed out on the main race victory due to external circumstances. This year, we aim to claim that win with the EVO version of our GT car. With Raffaele Marciello and Sheldon van der Linde, we have two drivers who have repeatedly proved their class at this street race in recent years. Add to that two experienced teams, and we have created the best possible conditions for the next BMW M Motorsport victory in the Main Race since 2018.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello: \"I’m really excited to return to Macau. It’s one of the best races of the year, and the track is fantastic. This year, we have a new qualifying format with a Superpole, which will be very interesting. Together with ROWE Racing, I’ve had some very strong performances this season, so I’m happy to be back with this great team. Last year, we came close to victory. This time, we’ll give it our all to stand on the top step of the podium.\"\n\nSheldon van der Linde: \"I love this race and definitely want to keep coming back until I win it. That’s one of my big goals. We’ve been strong over the past two years and made it to the podium in 2024. I want to build on that momentum together with Team WRT. We work very well together, and hopefully, we can be serious contenders for the win. This will be my third start in Macau – and as they say, third time’s the charm.\""

      "content": "Barcelona. What a spectacular season finale for the GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS in Barcelona (ESP)! The three-hour race at the Circuit de Catalunya concluded with a shower of titles and two podium finishes for the BMW M Motorsport teams. Kelvin van der Linde (RSA) and Charles Weerts (BEL) capped off a fantastic comeback by winning the drivers' title in the overall standings. At the same time, the overall team title went to Team WRT. Vincent Vosse's squad also celebrated winning the team championship in the GOLD Cup. In the SILVER category, Century Motorsport triumphed in the drivers' standings of the Endurance Cup. In the race itself, AlManar Racing by WRT and ROWE Racing secured second and third places on the podium.\n\nAfter a disappointing qualifying session for all BMW M Motorsport teams, the day initially didn’t seem destined for celebration. However, over the course of the three-hour race, all crews made significant progress. The #32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO started from 31st position after a penalty, but Weerts, van der Linde, and Ugo de Wilde (BEL) fought their way up to sixth place, earning enough points to crown van der Linde and Weerts as the new overall champions in the combined Sprint and Endurance Cup standings. The duo had also secured the Sprint Cup title just a few weeks earlier. Over the 2025 season, the #32 car achieved three victories and four additional podium finishes, which also secured the overall team title for Team WRT.\n\nAnother title for Team WRT was clinched by Jens Klingmann (GER), Al Faisal Al Zubair (OMA), and Ben Tuck (GBR) with an impressive second-place finish in the race. The overall podium for the #777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of AlManar Racing by WRT also secured the team title in the GOLD Cup. Third place on the podium in Barcelona went to Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), and Raffaele Marciello (SUI) in the #98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of ROWE Racing.\n\nDespite a challenging race that included an early, unavoidable spin, Jarrod Waberski (RSA), Mex Jansen (NED), and William Moore (GBR) still had reason to celebrate as the trio won the drivers' title in the SILVER category of the Endurance Cup with the #42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO of Century Motorsport.\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"What a season finale in the GT World Challenge Europe! Congratulations to Kelvin van der Linde, Charles Weerts, and Team WRT on winning the overall titles. This triumph highlights the impressive consistency of the team and drivers in both Sprint and Endurance races, which present completely different challenges. To crown this strong season with such a spectacular comeback of 25 positions today is fantastic. My heartfelt congratulations also go to the champions in the GOLD and SILVER Cups. AlManar Racing by WRT and Century Motorsport delivered outstanding performances throughout the season and represented BMW M Motorsport more than worthily in this highly competitive racing series. Looking at the race itself, congratulations to AlManar Racing by WRT and ROWE Racing for their podium finishes after equally impressive comebacks. A big thank you to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to the teams who contributed to this extremely successful GT World Challenge Europe season!\"\n\nVincent Vosse (Team Principal, WRT): \"I’m incredibly happy that we were able to finish the season like this. Winning the overall titles was the big goal after the Sprint Cup titles. It didn’t look like it after qualifying, but huge thanks to the team for the spot-on strategic call in the first stint, which brought us forward. Congratulations to the #777 crew for their podium and the team title in the GOLD Cup. I want to sincerely thank everyone in the team whose hard work made such a successful season possible.\"\n\nKelvin van der Linde (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Champion): \"It has been a fantastic season, crowned with the overall championship. Of course, our race pace today wasn’t particularly strong. We need to learn from this during the break to improve for next year. But looking at the entire season, we were probably the most consistent team – and that’s the reward. I’m very proud of the entire Team WRT, Charles, and Ugo. It’s the perfect conclusion to my first GT World Challenge season with BMW M Motorsport. I’m very proud.\"\n\nCharles Weerts (#32 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Team WRT, Champion): \"It was a very good season. Sprint Cup winners and overall champions – that’s everything we could have wished for at the start of the year. We made almost no mistakes and got the best out of every situation. The only regret is Spa, as it’s the biggest race, and we could have put ourselves in an even better position for the Endurance Cup there. But overall, we can be very proud of the season. A big thank you to BMW M Motorsport for providing us with an incredibly strong car. Thanks also to Team WRT, Kelvin, and Ugo for a great season we shared together.\"\n\nJens Klingmann (#777 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, AlManar Racing by WRT, 2nd place): \"What an incredible race! At the start of the weekend, we didn’t feel like we had the fastest car, so we focused on long-run performance with the setup. During the race, a brilliant strategic decision in the first stint moved us far forward, and Ben was even able to work his way almost to the front. For me, it got tight at the end due to the late safety car, but I’m super happy with second place and winning the team title in the GOLD Cup. Once again, we’ve shown what can be achieved through perfect teamwork.\"\n\nRaffaele Marciello (#98 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, ROWE Racing, 3rd place): \"We had a strong final race. At the start, we had some luck with the safety car and benefitted from a good strategy. I had a very good stint with some overtakes. Without the issue at Paul Ricard and the retirement in Monza, we could have been in the championship fight. Overall, though, we can be satisfied with our season – and we’ll try to come back even stronger next year.\"\n\nJarrod Waberski (#42 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Century Motorsport, SILVER Champion Endurance Cup): \"This season was spectacular. From the first race, we were able to score points consistently, won at Monza, and stood on the podium at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Here in Barcelona, after the spin in the first lap, we thought the title might slip away from us, but we stuck together as a team, fought back, and ultimately brought the title home. Many thanks to Century Motorsport and BMW M Motorsport for this amazing year.\""

      "content": "Estoril. Two more victories on the road to the riders’ world championship title and important points for the manufacturers’ battle – Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR), BMW Motorrad Motorsport, and the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team once again shone at Estoril. The penultimate round of the 2025 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) took place at the Portuguese circuit near Lisbon. Riding his #1 BMW M 1000 RR, Razgatlioglu won both the first main race and the Superpole race, and added a second-place podium finish in race two. He also set new lap records over the weekend. As the leader of the riders’ standings, “El Turco” now heads to the season finale at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) with a 39-point lead over his closest rival Nicolò Bulega (ITA / Ducati).\n\nTeammate Michael van der Mark (NED) also showed strong form at Estoril. In Saturday’s first race, he was caught up in a multi-rider incident at the first corner through no fault of his own. He was able to take part in the restart but faced technical issues and finished 15th. In the Superpole race, he secured an important ninth place to improve his grid position for race two, where he finished tenth – once again inside the top ten.\n\nIn the manufacturers’ standings, BMW remains hot on the heels of leaders Ducati, trailing by just three points ahead of the final round. A total of 62 points will still be up for grabs in the last three races of the season at Jerez de la Frontera.\n\nReactions after the Estoril round.\n\nSven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another important step towards the title and an almost perfect weekend for us. With two victories and a second place, we can now travel to Jerez with a very solid points advantage. Toprak’s performance was once again outstanding. At the same time, Nicolò Bulega’s performance also deserves recognition. What those two showed in the races, pulling away from the rest of the field, was on another level. We are also very happy with Mickey’s performance; he did a great job with his top-ten results. I think he too is ready for his, for now, last race weekend in WorldSBK. We will now do everything we can – in Berlin, Munich, England, and at the track – to be as well prepared as possible, and we’re looking forward to the season finale.”\n\nChristian Gonschor, Technical Director BMW Motorrad Motorsport: “It was another fantastic weekend with two wins, pole position, lap records, and a second place. With this tremendous weekend, Toprak extended his lead in the riders’ championship – a maximum success that the entire team can be proud of. Toprak showed his professionalism in every race, and in the second main race he knew that second place was also crucial for the championship, for the big goal. He didn’t take any unnecessary risks to go for the win. Looking ahead to Jerez, we are excited for an intense finale, and we want to express our gratitude to the organisers and the FIM, whose control and regulatory mechanisms ensure fair competition that thrills fans at the track and on TV with two magnificent riders at the front.”\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I was really happy to win the first race. At the beginning, all was under control but then Nicolò had a bit more grip than me. At the end of the race I was spinning a lot but he was too. In the Superpole race, the start was a bit difficult, I was fighting with Nicolò on the first two laps. But then I just focused on my pace, pushing for a good lap time and trying to not make any mistake. So in the end I won again. Race two was more difficult for me. I was back in fifth, had to overtake but just focused on my job to catch Nicolò. When I was back in second place I was pushing so hard on every lap that the rear tyre dropped, so I was struggling a lot. I had to start to manage my race and I just thought: ‘Okay, this time it is impossible to win, P2 is enough because I need the good points for the championship.’ Now I am looking forward to Jerez. We have some margin in the championship, and everything else we will see there. Nicolò is very strong at Jerez but I will try to do my best again.”\n\nMichael van der Mark, ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At the last couple of rounds we had a great feeling with the bike and then we came here and for some reason we struggled quite a lot with the bike in the beginning. We couldn’t get the right feeling and not the right speed on Friday. For Saturday morning, we improved our pace and our package a lot. I was confident for Superpole but unfortunately I lost a lot of time by missing a gear. Especially here you lose a lot of places on the grid and P12 was not fantastic. In race one, I had a good start, but unfortunately someone crashed in turn one and took me out. The guys in the pit box made sure that the spare bike was ready and I was able to do the re-start. After a few good laps I unfortunately had a technical issue. I managed to finish the race and score one point, but it was a very disappointing Saturday. In Sunday’s Superpole race we decided to go with the race tyre as we felt that the qualifying tyre was a big risk. I finished P9 which was not too bad. It was good to move up on the grid, especially for turn one. My start in race two was not great but I had a good pace. I was catching up with the guys in front of me, but I just seemed to struggle a bit with the bike when I got really close to them. I was fighting hard and finished tenth collecting more points. Now I’m looking forward to Jerez, especially in regards of the championship. It looks like Toprak will win it there, so that’s the thing everyone is looking out for.”\n\nAir temperature: 24°, track temperature: 28°, humidity: 54%, conditions: dry.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\n* New all-time lap record\n\nAir temperature: 24°, track temperature: 37°, humidity: 40%, conditions: dry, laps: 18.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Toprak Razgatlioglu, lap 4, 1:35.696 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 23°, track temperature: 29°, humidity: 57%, conditions: dry, laps: 10.\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 5, 1:34.973 (new record)\n\nAir temperature: 25°, track temperature: 38°, humidity: 51%, conditions: dry, laps: 21.\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ITA)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nbimota by Kawasaki Racing Team\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nFastest race lap: Nicolò Bulega, lap 8, 1:34.973\n\nCurrent riders’ classification (R11/12, after 33 of 36 races).\n\nToprak Razgatlioglu (TUR)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAlvaro Bautista (ESP)\n\nAruba.it Racing - Ducati\n\nAndrea Locatelli (ITA)\n\nDanilo Petrucci (ITA)\n\nBarni Spark Racing Team\n\nMichael van der Mark (NED)\n\nROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team\n\nCurrent manufacturers’ classification (R11/12, after 33 of 36 races)."

      "content": "Road Atlanta. BMW M Motorsport concludes the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) season with mixed emotions. There was great celebration over the victory of the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO from Paul Miller Racing in the GTD PRO class. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER), and Connor De Phillippi (USA) triumphed at Petit Le Mans in Road Atlanta (USA). The victory secured the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup title for Harper and Hesse. BMW M Team RLL delivered a strong farewell race with the BMW M Hybrid V8 but was denied the deserved result due to a puncture on the #24 car shortly before the finish .\n\nPhilipp Eng (AUT), Dries Vanthoor (BEL), and Kevin Magnussen (DEN) were on course for fourth place after a consistently strong race, but around ten minutes before the finish, Eng reported a right-rear tyre puncture. The subsequent pit stop dropped the crew back to ninth place. In the #25 car, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER), and Robin Frijns (NED) finished eleventh. The trio lost touch with the leaders due to two drive-through penalties. The Petit Le Mans marked the final race for BMW M Team RLL with the BMW M Hybrid V8. After 17 years, 25 victories, and more than 100 podium finishes, the collaboration with BMW M Motorsport comes to an end. Starting in 2026, BMW M Team WRT will take over the racing operations in the GTP class.\n\nIn the GTD PRO class, the #48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO crew from Paul Miller Racing delivered a dominant weekend. Harper secured pole position in qualifying for the second consecutive time. During the race, the car led for nearly the entire ten hours and crossed the finish line as a well-deserved winner with a comfortable margin. The victory secured the Endurance Cup title for Harper and Hesse in their debut IMSA season. The #1 sister car fell far behind early in the race due to a technical issue and finished in ninth place. Turner Motorsport, competing in the GTD class, achieved eighth place with Robby Foley, Patrick Gallagher, and Jake Walker (all USA).\n\nComments after the race:\n\nAndreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: \"Congratulations to Paul Miller Racing, Dan Harper, Max Hesse, and Connor De Phillippi on their fantastic victory, which also secured the Endurance Cup title for Dan and Max. It was truly a perfect race. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as we had hoped in the GTP class. For nine hours and 50 minutes, we were on course for second place in the drivers' standings, which would have been a great result. Then, the #24 car suffered the misfortune of a puncture. The #25 car was set back by two drive-through penalties. Unfortunately, the results don’t reflect our performance. The BMW M Hybrid V8 was strong in the race and had the potential for much better results. This was the final race for BMW M Team RLL with us in the GTP class. I want to sincerely thank the team for their dedication and loyalty over so many years and wish them all the best for the future. A big thank you also to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and to our customer teams, Paul Miller Racing and Turner Motorsport, for a great season.\"\n\nPhilipp Eng (#24 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 9th place): \"It’s unbelievable that we suffered a puncture just ten minutes before the finish. We were in a good position, had a strong package, and were on course for fourth place in the race. That would have meant second place in the drivers' standings for Dries and me. It’s really disappointing, but life goes on. A big thank you to Dries for being such an incredible teammate this season. I especially want to thank BMW M Team RLL for eight great years together. Our first race at Daytona in 2018 was my debut in a works programme. Since then, we’ve experienced so much, and I’ve made many friends in the team. That makes this farewell emotional for me. Thanks also to BMW M Motorsport for all the hard work throughout the season.\"\n\nSheldon van der Linde (#25 BMW M Hybrid V8, BMW M Team RLL, 11th place): \"A tough end to a tough season – that probably sums up our year best. We often had the potential but didn’t manage to put everything together. We’ll take many lessons from this season. We didn’t get everything right, so maybe we didn’t deserve to be at the very top. But 2026 is a new year, and hopefully, we’ll come back stronger.\"\n\nDan Harper (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"What a fantastic weekend! It started great with pole position – my second in a row. The race was a first for Max and me, and it was great to have Connor with his Petit Le Mans experience on board. All three of us did a flawless job. The car doesn’t have a scratch, which is incredibly important in a long-distance race on such a narrow track with much faster prototypes. The race was a lot of fun, and ending the season with this victory and the Endurance Cup title is amazing. Unfortunately, we had some issues in other races this season, which cost us the chance to win the overall championship.\"\n\nMax Hesse (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"I’m pretty speechless and exhausted after this tough race. Everyone said beforehand that Petit Le Mans is one of the hardest races to win. The fact that we managed to do it on our first attempt is incredible. Winning the Endurance Cup title on top of that crowns this day. Huge thanks to Paul Miller Racing for the perfect job and to BMW M Motorsport for the great car.\"\n\nConnor De Phillippi (#48 BMW M4 GT3 EVO, Paul Miller Racing, 1st place GTD PRO): \"For me, it was something new and special to race across two cars. Unfortunately, we had technical issues with the #1 car relatively early, so my focus shifted to the #48. The car felt fantastic and was very fast throughout the race. The team also did a flawless job. That’s how you win endurance races.\""

      "content": "Munich. Today, the Board of Management of BMW AG has changed the outlook for the 2025 financial year.\n\nWhereas the company delivered volume growth year to date September in the European and Americas regions, however, the targeted volume growth in China remained below expectations. On this basis, the BMW Group decided to reduce volume expectations for the Chinese market in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the impact of a significant reduction of commissions from local Chinese banks in connection with the brokering of financial and insurance products to end customers requires financial support to strengthen dealer profitability.\n\nFurthermore, some of the assumptions on tariff reductions made at the time of its half year reporting have not been fully realised to date. In this context the BMW Group continues, however, to maintain the assumption that the EU implement the agreement with the US on reduction of tariffs from 10% to 0% on the import of vehicles and auto parts into the EU effective 1st August.\n\nAccounting for these additional factors weighing on profit, the Auto EBIT margin for 2025 will remain in the guided corridor of 5% to 7%, more specifically in the range of 5% to 6%.\n\nThe outlook for the 2025 financial year has been adjusted as follows:\n\nContrary to assumptions made to date, the BMW Group now assumes that reimbursements of customs duties from the American and German authorities totaling a high three-digit million figure will not be received in 2025, but only paid in 2026. Considering these reimbursements and the impact on profit outlined above, free cashflow in Segment Automotive for the year 2025 is expected to be above €2.5bn (previously above €5bn).\n\nThe dividend payout ratio remains in the corridor of 30% to 40% of net income attributable to BMW AG shareholders. Additionally, the BMW Group remains committed to the share buyback program.\n\nThe full quarterly results and the adjusted outlook report will be published on 5 November 2025 in the BMW Group Quarterly Statement to 30 September 2025. The definitions of the KPIs can be found in the Glossary of the BMW Group Report 2024 on pages 427 to 429.\n\nBMW Group Corporate Communications\n\nDr Britta Ullrich, Communications Finance\n\nTelephone: +49 151 601 18364\n\nMax-Morten Borgmann, Head of Communications BMW Group, Finance, Sales\n\nTelephone: +49 151 601-24118\n\nMedia website: www.press.bmwgroup.com/deutschland\n\nWith its four brands, BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles and also provides premium financial services. The BMW Group production network comprises over 30 production sites worldwide; the company has a global sales network in more than 140 countries.\n\nIn 2024, the BMW Group sold 2.45 million passenger vehicles and more than 210,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the financial year 2024 was € 11.0 billion on revenues amounting to € 142.4 billion. As of 31 December 2024, the BMW Group had a workforce of 159,104 employees.\n\nThe success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term thinking and responsible action.

      "content": "Munich. The BMW Group maintained its growth trajectory in the third quarter, with customer deliveries rising by +8.8%. This also reflects the positive impact of the base effect from a weaker prior-year quarter. From January to September 2025, the BMW Group delivered a total of around 1.8 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers, achieving slight sales growth of +2.4%. During the same period, the company increased sales of fully-electric vehicles by +10.0% to 323,447 units. Between January and September, the BMW Group delivered a total of 470,313 electrified vehicles (BEV and PHEV) to customers (+15.0%).\n\n“The BMW Group reported a slight sales increase for the year to the end of September. The strong sales performance in Europe and the Americas, as well as for the MINI brand, is particularly encouraging. Demand for our wide range of electrified vehicles also remains strong,” said Jochen Goller, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales.\n\nThe BMW brand sold 514,620 vehicles in the third quarter (+ 5.7%). In the year to the end of September, sales were in line with the previous year (+0.1%), with a total of 1,585,580 units delivered to customers, including 395,998 electrified vehicles (+4.5%). The brand continued to increase sales across all regions outside of China, achieving particularly strong growth in the Europe and Americas regions, while the targeted sales increase in the Chinese market did not materialize as expected. BMW plug-in hybrids are in high demand. As a result, the brand increased its global deliveries of vehicles with this drive technology by +30.2% compared to the previous year.\n\nBetween January and September, BMW M GmbH delivered 158.182 units to customers, up +7.9% year-on-year. Following its most successful half-year ever, BMW M GmbH reported another strong third quarter, with sales rising 11,0% to 52,220 units.\n\nThe MINI brand remained on track for growth with the New MINI Family: In the third quarter, the brand delivered 72,376 units – an increase of +37.5%. From January to September, 206,214 vehicles were sold worldwide (+23.7%). During this period, MINI reported growth across all sales regions.\n\nIn the YTD September, the Rolls-Royce brand delivered 4,100 motor cars to customers – +3.3% more than during the same period of last year. In the first nine months of the year, BMW Motorrad delivered a total of 159,156 motorcycles and scooters to customers (-2.6%).

      "content": "London/Munich. From October 15 to 19, Frieze London and Frieze Masters will return to London’s Regent’s Park. As one of Frieze’s long-standing global partners since 2004, BMW honours the artistic work of David Hockney as part of the BMW Art Car World Tour and provides VIP shuttle service. Frieze London takes its place on the global stage as part of the ever-expanding BMW Art Car World Tour, a journey that will span continents and continue well into 2026. Marking the 50th anniversary of this iconic series, the tour brings together a constellation of exhibitions across five continents, enriched by a vibrant array of events.\n\nThe iconic Art Car #14, designed by David Hockney 30 years ago, will be on display in The Lobby of The Peninsula London from October 14 to November 3. During the “Peninsula Classic Car Afternoon Tea” which runs through November 18 there will be a special opportunity to engage with Hockney’s Art Car: BMW representatives will dive deep into the origins and lead through the journey of Hockney’s Art Car design on October 14 and 15. Sculptural culinary delights will be served to bring together the British tea tradition and the BMW Art Cars’ golden jubilee. The final days of the exhibition coincide with RM Sotheby’s Classic Car auction presented in partnership with the Royal Automobile Club which brings a selection of significant automobiles– from historic treasures to modern collectibles – to The Peninsula.\n\nDavid Hockney’s BMW 850CSi puts a new spin on the traditional idea of a car’s paintwork by effectively turning the car inside out. “I thought it would be a good idea to show the car as if one could see inside,” he said. Like an X-ray, Hockney’s design reveals the anatomy of the car and its occupants: the door sports an outline of the driver, and Hockney’s loyal dachshund, Stanley, can be seen sitting on the back seat, referencing the artist’s love of his dogs. Stylised engine components are depicted on the bonnet, while expanses of green sweep across the body – a visual metaphor for the passing scenery, movement, and time. Hockney’s visual language melds the car’s interior and the outside world to create a new and unusual perspective on motoring.\n\nBorn in Bradford, England, in 1937, David Hockney has been one of the most flamboyant and influential protagonists on the international art scene since the early 1960s. He graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1962 and soon joined the exclusive circles of Swinging Sixties London. He established his style as his very own form of international Pop Art and achieved great popularity with it. His works – among them iconic images depicting swimming pools and Californian landscapes – illustrate his lifelong fascination with light, colour, and the relationship between perspective and movement. David Hockney’s Art Car was intended solely as an exhibition piece and has never been driven on the road or in a race.\n\nThe BMW Art Car World Tour charts an ambitious course, with stops at prestigious destinations such as Art Basel Hong Kong, the Le Mans Classic in France, Belgium’s Zoute Grand Prix, the Shanghai Motor Show in China, and Italy’s Concorso d’Eleganza, among others. Showcasing the collection of 20 iconic BMW Art Cars, the tour serves as a testament to the company’s deep-rooted commitment to global cultural engagement – spanning more than a hundred initiatives across contemporary art, music, film, and design.

From New York to Istanbul, and from Hong Kong to Knokke-Heist, the tour connects cultures through a shared fascination for creativity and speed. Visitors will have the opportunity to admire iconic BMW Art Cars set against the backdrop of the Zoute Grand Prix (8-12 October 2025), an event renowned for celebrating automotive heritage, design elegance, and the timeless beauty of classic automobiles. The unique convergence of art and motoring provides a rare chance for the public to witness the seamless fusion of engineering and creative vision into a truly singular experience.\n\nThe presence of BMW Art Cars in Belgium highlights the global impact of the BMW Art Car initiative and its ability to connect diverse audiences through bold and compelling visual storytelling. By pairing the Art Car exhibition with the Zoute Grand Prix, BMW and the event organisers foster a dialogue between the timeless romance of classic cars and the ever-evolving language of contemporary art. This juxtaposition invites reflection on the intersection of movement, form, and identity— and how design continues to bring life into heritage.\n\nThe BMW Art Cars arriving in Belgium have travelled from across the world, including Julie Mehretu BMW M Hybrid V8, which was recently exhibited in New York and Istanbul. It joins masterpieces by Alexander Calder, Frank Stella, Robert Rauschenberg, Matazo Kayama, Cesar Manrique, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, and Jeff Koons for this very special public presentation.\n\nAnother milestone is that 2025 marks the centenary of Robert Rauschenberg’s birth, offering a unique opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this pioneering American artist. This occasion will be commemorated with a year-long programme of international exhibitions and events. These will highlight his enduring influence on subsequent generations of artists and his dedication to social progress.\n\nThe the Zoute Grand Prix. Held annually in Knokke-Heist, the Zoute Grand Prix is one of Europe’s most prestigious automotive events, where heritage, design, and innovation come together. The gathering unites collectors, enthusiasts, and creators to celebrate automotive culture.\n\nFor more information, please visit: https://www.zoutegrandprix.be/en\n\nCelebrating 50 Years: The BMW Art Car Collection.The BMW Art Car initiative came from French racing driver and art dealer Hervé Poulain, who, together with then BMW Head of Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, asked his artist friend Alexander Calder to paint a car. The result was a completely reimagined BMW 3.0 CSL, which went on to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975 and became a crowd favorite. In the years that followed, art icons like Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Esther Mahlangu, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, and Julie Mehretu have enriched the collection, each in their own individual style.\n\nThe BMW vehicles that have been turned into works of art using a wide variety of graphic and artistic techniques are as different as the artists themselves – from pure racing thoroughbreds to production vehicles and rare sports cars. The results are all vastly different. No two vehicles are alike. BMW Art Car artists are selected by an independent worldwide jury of museum directors and curators, and the artist always maintains complete creative freedom throughout the entire process.\n\nBMW Group’s global cultural engagement and updates on the Art Car World Tour can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."

      "content": "Munich. BMW is bringing innovation and electric mobility into new areas of life with its new electric stand-up paddleboard (SUP). The BMW x SipaBoards is the product of a collaboration with Slovenian manufacturer SipaBoards, the market leader in the field. The boards are self-inflating and combine electric drive technology with high-grade materials, digital connectivity and a flexible energy system. This is the first time BMW has offered an electrically powered product designed for water sports, opening up a new chapter in riding pleasure in the process. BMW Group Designworks took care of the visuals.\n\nElectric lifestyle on the water.\n\nStand-up paddleboarding has grown into an extremely popular, on-trend sport over recent years. It brings together physical activity, immersion in nature and low barriers to entry – and therefore appeals to first-timers and experienced water sports enthusiasts alike. The BMW x SipaBoards brings a new dimension to the paddleboarding experience in the form of electric assistance, connectivity and intuitive control. The result is a new level of mobility on the water and the confluence of comfort and adventure.\n\nAt the heart of the BMW x SipaBoards is an integrated motor generating up to 300 watts of power. It produces additional thrust while on the move and makes paddling easier – especially into headwinds or currents. The drivetrain, with a propeller developed specifically for BMW, runs emission-free and near silently, and delivers a unique riding experience at speeds of up to 7.5 km/h (4 knots). The motor also comes in handy by pumping up the board automatically before you head out. The requisite energy is supplied by battery modules, which are available with a range of different capacities – to respond to individual requirements – and can be swapped out in just a few simple steps.\n\nStructural solidity and extensive connectivity.\n\nIts specially developed X-woven drop-stitch core gives the e-SUP superb structural rigidity and stability. The board is intuitive to use, via a new user interface (UI) with Bluetooth remote control – whose design was inspired by the BMW Neue Klasse – built into the paddle. It allows the rider to toggle into FREUDE Mode for extra power, eye-catching light effects and haptic feedback. A smartphone app brings additional functionality, enabling users to plan routes, for example, monitor the battery charge and utilise GPS tracking. An additional safety feature is the automatic power cut-off, which is triggered by a Bluetooth signal. If the paddle falls into the water, a return signal is immediately transmitted that automatically cuts the motor. This means the board remains under control at all times, including in unexpected situations, and makes riding extremely safe.\n\nFun for up to two people per SUP.\n\nThe board and all-carbon-fibre paddle fuse robustness with lightness, and deliver an exceptional on-the-water riding experience. The board is 3.65 m long, 0.82 m wide, 0.15 m thick and weighs 10.9 kilograms (14.9 kg including the motor). It is designed to carry two people.

      "content": "Hockenheim. The dream of a fourth DTM drivers' title for René Rast (GER) has been shattered. In the final race of the season at the Hockenheimring (GER), the 38-year-old had excellent chances in the showdown for the championship after a strong start, running in second place. However, a collision in the first lap ended all his hopes. On Friday, ahead of the race weekend, Rast had announced his provisional retirement from DTM. Marco Wittmann (GER) shone in the Sunday race, securing a podium finish in second place during a dramatic season finale.\n\nAfter finishing seventh on Saturday, Rast started Sunday’s race from fifth position but quickly moved up to second place in the first few corners thanks to a brilliant start. However, at the hairpin, he was pushed wide and, as a result of a chain reaction, was hit twice by other cars. His #33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO sustained such severe damage that he had to retire from the race in the very first lap, ending his bid for a fourth DTM title. A victory, which was well within reach, would have been enough to crown him champion. Thus, Rast concluded what is, at least for now, his final DTM season in position sixth in the drivers' standings.\n\nOn Friday, Rast had already announced that he would not compete in DTM in 2026, choosing instead to focus on other race programmes with BMW M Motorsport. Over eight full seasons, Rast achieved three titles, 31 victories, and 26 pole positions. He did not rule out a potential return to DTM at a later date.\n\nFor Marco Wittmann, the season ended with a fantastic comeback and a dramatic final lap. Starting from 17th on the grid, Wittmann climbed to second place and challenged Ayhancan Güven (TUR, Porsche) for the race win in the final sprint, as Güven was fighting for the championship title. Wittmann initially overtook Güven but was countered by a bold move from Güven just a few corners before the finish line. Thanks to his second-place finish, Wittmann ended the season in position five in the drivers' standings. Schubert Motorsport secured second place in the team standings. The team from Oschersleben (GER) celebrated a total of three victories by Rast and six additional podium finishes in 2025 – two for Rast and four for Wittmann.\n\nADAC GT Masters: Podium finish for FK Performance Motorsport to close the season. As in the DTM, BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers were in the title fight until the final weekend in Hockenheim in the supporting series ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany. However, the ultimate success also eluded them there. In the ADAC GT Masters, the FK Performance Motorsport duo Leyton Fourie (RSA) and Tim Zimmermann (GER) in the #11 BMW M4 GT3 EVO ended the season on a positive note with a second-place podium finish.\n\nAndreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): \"Congratulations to Marco Wittmann for a fantastic podium finish in Sunday’s race. That was a very strong performance. However, looking at the championship, the disappointment naturally outweighs the positives. After Marco was practically out of the race on Saturday due to a tyre issue, things looked very promising for René Rast. He had a strong weekend and was already in second place after the start on Sunday. Unfortunately, the collision at the hairpin cost him all his chances. We would have preferred to fight for the title until the final lap, but it wasn’t meant to be. Many thanks to everyone at BMW M Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport for a very good season with the BMW M4 GT3 EVO. We were in the title race with both drivers until the final weekend, which underscores our consistently strong performance. The pit stops by the crews were especially outstanding. Congratulations to Ayhancan Güven and Manthey EMA on winning the title!\"\n\nBjörn Lellmann (Head of Customer Racing at BMW M Motorsport): \"We can all be proud of this DTM season. We were in the title fight until the very end and have made significant progress compared to last year. René Rast and Marco Wittmann were very close throughout the season and brought success to the team together. It’s bitter that the season ended this way. We lost René in the first lap, and Marco would have deserved the win in the final race. Unfortunately, it wasn’t meant to be, but we’ll come back stronger next season. In the ADAC GT Masters and ADAC GT4 Germany, we unfortunately lost our title chances as well. Nevertheless, the podium finish for FK Performance Motorsport in the ADAC GT Masters is a positive conclusion. Our teams and drivers have learned a lot and will surely come back stronger.\"\n\nTorsten Schubert (Team Principal, Schubert Motorsport): \"It’s incredibly unfortunate that René Rast’s race ended so early today. He was already past Ayhancan Güven but was then pushed wide, leading to the unfortunate collision. Such incidents can happen in the tight DTM starts. You could see from Marco Wittmann's pace, the strong strategy, and the quick pit stops what would have been possible for René today as well. Marco stormed from 17th to second place and truly deserved the win. He drove a fantastic race. Overall, we had a good season and celebrated several victories. Our pit stops were consistently top-level. It would have been well-deserved for us to finish at the top of the championship standings. But we’ll take it as it is and come back stronger next season.\"\n\nMarco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 18th place, R2: 2nd place): \"Climbing from 17th to second was a strong statement to end the season, I think. The final lap is certainly up for debate. I was already past Ayhancan Güven, and his counter-move in the Sachs Curve was borderline from my perspective. Nevertheless, it was a nice season finale for me. Of course, I feel very sorry for René that he was taken out of the race so early. I think we had a strong package today. Overall, it was a crazy season with a title fight that I believe is rare in DTM. We lost too much ground at some events, which ultimately took us out of the title fight. Still, we can be satisfied in the end. This season provides a solid foundation to build on.\"\n\nRené Rast (#33 RoboMarkets BMW M4 GT3 EVO, R1: 7th place, R2: DNF): \"I’m at a loss for words after this bitter end to the season. My start in Sunday’s race was fantastic; I was already in second place, and the pace of our car was excellent. I think a win was absolutely possible. To be taken out of the title fight in this way in the first lap is incredibly bitter. This is not the conclusion I had dreamed of for my DTM career. However, I decided some time ago to at least temporarily end my DTM journey. I will not be competing in the DTM in 2026. This decision was not an easy one for me, as this racing series has been like a second home to me. I would like to sincerely thank all the teams I have raced with, the mechanics who gave their all in the garage, and the engineers who never stopped striving for perfection. Without your hard work and passion, my successes would not have been possible. I am also deeply grateful for the memories, the victories, the challenges, and especially for the fans who have supported me every step of the way. Even though I won’t be on the DTM grid next year, I am excited about the opportunities ahead – and who knows what the future will bring?\""

      "content": "Irlbach-Straßkirchen. Construction of BMW Group’s new high-voltage battery assembly plant in the municipalities of Irlbach and Straßkirchen (Straubing-Bogen district) is progressing at high speed.\n\n“With the completion of the Energy Centre building and the fire station, we have reached the next important milestone on the road to serial production for the new generation 6 high-voltage batteries here in Lower Bavaria,” says Sabrina Kugler, Project Manager for Plant Construction Irlbach-Straßkirchen. “The Energy Centre supplies the new plant with all the essential utilities. In addition, there are around 3,000 square metres with optimal conditions for the fire department.”\n\nFor safety: Fire service on duty 24/7\n\nIn June, the BMW fire brigade began its around-the-clock duty on the BMW Group Irlbach-Straßkirchen site. With five service vehicles and 26 people working in shifts, the fire service will ensure the safety of employees at the site. The accreditation process as a plant fire brigade is currently underway.\n\nThe team comprises experienced colleagues from other BMW Group sites in Bavaria as well as newly trained plant firefighters recruited from the region. Two of the new employees are also active in the volunteer fire departments in Irlbach and Straßkirchen. Training events and exercises continue to be closely coordinated with the nearby municipal fire brigades.\n\nCentral control unit for all essential resources\n\nFor Silvia Meyer, Head of Real Estate Management at the Irlbach-Straßkirchen plant, the Energy Centre is the “heart” of the new high-voltage battery assembly plant. “Here future production and the ancillary buildings are supplied with all necessary media – electricity, cooling, heat, cooling water and compressed air.” The utility media are controlled in the so-called Operations Centre. The building’s heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting are controlled automatically and resource-efficiently via the energy control technology installed there. With the help of sensors, all key production facilities and rooms are continuously monitored and visualised in real time on the control room screens.\n\nWaste heat from production used for heating\n\nWaste heat from the production processes is used to heat the canteen, storage and ancillary buildings at low temperatures. To do this, heat pumps in the Energy Centre convert the roughly 23°C chilled water heated by the production plants into heating energy at about 60°C. Four heat pumps, each with 1.8 MW, guarantee fault-tolerant heating capacity.\n\nThe entire piping system of the Energy Centre extends over 3.8 kilometres and is initially filled with 500,000 litres of water. The production and assembly process for high-voltage batteries requires no water. Drinking water at the site is used only for kitchens and washbasins. Rainwater collected on the roofs is used for toilets.\n\nHighly automated production process requires compressed air\n\nThe highly automated material-handling technology in the production process for high-voltage batteries continuously requires compressed air. The energy center supplies compressed air at 6 bar to the systems in the production. Two redundant compressors cover base load, and a variable compressor covers peak load. The waste heat from the compressors is also fed into the cooling-water circuit and again available for heating the factory via the heat pumps.\n\nPlant runs exclusively on renewable electricity\n\nAlthough a natural gas pipeline runs across the site, the energy supply for the BMW Group Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen in regular operation relies entirely on non-fossil energy sources. The plant is not connected to the natural gas pipeline.\n\nAt the new site, electricity is generated from solar energy to cover part of the total power demand. A photovoltaic installation will be installed on a roof area of around 62,000 square metres. The extent is more than a third of the roof area of the future production building, i.e. about the size of nine football pitches. The PV system will be installed and operated by the energy supplier VERBUND. Construction will begin in spring 2026, allowing it to be commissioned in time for the start of serial production. Nearly 14,000 photovoltaic modules can deliver over 6 MW peak (MWp) and thus generate more than 6,000 MWh per year. Any additional external electricity required will come entirely from renewable sources.\n\nThe electrical supply of the assembly plant will be provided via underground 110 kV cables connected to a substation operated by Bayernwerk Netz GmbH in Irlbach, which is currently under construction. Until the substation is completed in 2028, a provisional 34 MW connection to the existing 110 kV high-voltage lines will ensure a stable power supply for the current construction site and the future production operation.\n\nIn addition, two own transformers with a maximum reference capacity of 68 MW have been installed on the site near the Energy Centre. They initially convert the 110 kV supply to 20 kV for distribution on the site. Transformers located close to consumption provide the 230 V and 400 V supplies.\n\nRadio mast secures mobile phone coverage\n\nThe Energy Centre also plays a key role in the plant’s mobile phone coverage: a radio mast on the roof of the Energy Centre provides mobile coverage for the outdoor areas of the site. Inside the plant, around 220 antennas have already been installed in various buildings, and more than 9.5 kilometres of RF cable and 3.5 kilometres of fibre optic cable have been laid to ensure coverage across the entire site.\n\nDigital planning tool BIM accelerates construction progress\n\nThe approximately 10,400 square metre building for the Energy Centre and Fire Station was completed in just under 14 months.\n\nA key contributor to this short construction period was Building Information Modelling (BIM), a digital planning method. BMW Group applies the BIM approach consistently in all planning and realisation processes for the new Plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen. The system networks data and workflows of all project participants from planning through construction to operation.\n\nThe use of BIM ensures that all project participants have access to the current planning status. The method helps identify and optimise interfaces between all project participants at an early stage. An autonomous drone is used to continuously compare the current construction progress (as-built) with the digital building model (as-planned). Deviations are identified quickly so that corresponding measures can be taken. BIM is thus a fundamental component for a smooth commissioning, acceptance and handover (IAÜ process) of the buildings and systems.\n\nFurther information on the BMW Group plant Irlbach-Straßkirchen can be found on the project website – www.bmwgroup-werke.com/irlbach-strasskirchen."

      "content": "Leipzig. BMW Group Plant Leipzig is planning a hydrogen pipeline link – paving the way for it to become the first car plant in the world to receive hydrogen via a pipeline. Contracts have now been signed with MITNETZ GAS GmbH and ONTRAS Gastransport GmbH. The approx. 2-kilometre-long link will be constructed by MITNETZ GAS and incorporate a gas pressure and measurement system, eventually connecting the plant to the future core hydrogen network. BMW and ONTRAS are in the process of agreeing the appropriate connection to the hydrogen grid. The link is expected to start delivering hydrogen to the plant in mid-2027.\n\nOnce the pipeline is in place, Plant Leipzig will no longer need hydrogen deliveries by truck, in cylinders. “With supplies coming in via the pipeline, we will be able to use hydrogen in completely new ways – especially for our most energy-intensive processes, such as our curing ovens in the paintshop,” says Petra Peterhänsel, Director of BMW Group Plant Leipzig.\n\nIn October 2022 Plant Leipzig took a fuel-flexible burner on stream in its paintshop – another world first in automotive production. Today, it operates a total of eleven such bivalent burners, powered flexibly by gas or hydrogen.\n\nIn 2013 Leipzig also introduced hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklifts and tug trains and now operates an intralogistics fleet comprising more than 230 vehicles of this kind – the largest in Europe. They refuel at nine hydrogen refuelling stations located within the plant’s halls.\n\nThe core hydrogen network is a nationwide infrastructure project that will consist of approx. 9,000 kilometres of hydrogen pipes. It will go on stream in stages, reaching full operation by 2032 and connecting Germany to the transregional hydrogen network.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact:\n\nJochen Müller, Communications BMW Group Plant Leipzig\n\nMobile: +49-(0)151-60743152\n\nKai Lichte, Head of Communications BMW Group Plants Leipzig, Berlin, Eisenach\n\nTelephone: +49-(0)341-445-38000\n\nMobile: +49-(0)176-601-51240"

      "content": "Munich. As part of a racing weekend organized by Dener Motorsports at the former Formula 1 circuit “Circuito Estoril” near Lisbon/Portugal, a tribute event for the three-time Formula 1 world champion took place on the last weekend in August. The participation of BMW Group Classic occurred in close cooperation with Dener Pires, a close friend of Nelson Piquet.\n\nBMW Group Classic brought two of Nelson Piquet's legendary racing cars to the event. A Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo, in which he became the first turbo world champion in Formula 1 in 1983, and a BMW M1 Procar, in which he became BMW Procar champion in 1980.\n\nNelson Piquet grabbed the steering wheel on two days, first completing a shake-down in both cars and then doing a few laps of honour in the Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo the following day. Bernie Ecclestone, then Brabham team owner, Gordon Murray, then vehicle designer, and former Brabham racing mechanics travelled to Estoril especially for the event.\n\nThe last time Nelson Piquet drove his BMW Formula 1 car was 2015 at a Formula 1 Legends event in Spielberg, Austria. Ten years later, he travelled all the way from Brazil to Europe to take the wheel of his two legendary BMW racing cars himself, probably for the last time.\n\nThe racing mechanics from BMW Group Classic ensured that the vehicles were provided in perfect condition and also accompanied the event on site.\n\nAfter the Festival of Speed in Goodwood, the Brabham BMW BT 52 Turbo completed its second drive this year.\n\nFour questions for Nelson Piquet:\n\nWhat do you think when you see the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo today, after so many years?\n\nThe car was and is beautiful. It is a work of art. It was the best time of my life.\n\nWhat is your most vivid memory of the 1983 Formula 1 season?\n\nI remember the many test drives. I spent around 33,000 kilometres in the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo during test drives. In addition, there were around 7,000 kilometres during the 15 Formula 1 race weekends, including the training and qualifying sessions. We had a racing team, a Brabham test team and a BMW test team. We drove a lot. Back then, it was perhaps more personal and more like a family within the team.\n\nWhat was decisive for the Formula 1 world championship title in 1983?\n\nThe BMW turbo engine, although it was developed later than the competition. We developed the car and the engine in 1982 and won the championship in 1983. That was fantastic.\n\nBMW also used telemetry data transmission systems for the first time. These were not intended for driving or tuning the car, but only for the engine. But they were still very helpful.\n\nWe were able to solve technical problems quickly. For example, we had problems with fuel consumption that could be solved immediately after the race weekend during test drives. And we also had an extremely strong gearbox.\n\nHow difficult was it to handle the Brabham BMW BT52 Turbo with its enormous power?\n\nBack then, it was normal to deal with the power. Today it is very difficult and I brake much earlier than I did in the past.\n\nFormula 1 career of Nelson Piquet:\n\n1978-1991: 204 GPs, 23 GP victories (including 7 for BMW), 485.5 GP points\n\n20x second, 17x third\n\n3x world champion: 1981, 1983 (on BMW) and 1987\n\n1980 runner-up world champion\n\nBMW entries/successes of Nelson Piquet:\n\n1980: Winner of the Procar series in a BMW M1\n\n1981: Winner of the 1000km race at the Nürburgring in a BMW M1 Group 5 (with H.J.

      "content": "Munich. The factory duo for BMW Motorrad Motorsport in the 2026 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) is complete. After signing Italian rider Danilo Petrucci, his teammate for the 2026 season has now also been confirmed: it is Miguel Oliveira from Portugal. The 30-year-old will switch from MotoGP, where he has competed for seven years, to BMW Motorrad Motorsport in WorldSBK, and will race with the BMW M 1000 RR of the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team.\n\nOliveira began his international career on the world championship stage as a teenager in 2011 in the 125cc class. When this was replaced by the Moto3 World Championship in 2012, he competed in that category for several years. From 2016 to 2018, he was a permanent fixture in the Moto2 World Championship before stepping up to the premier class, MotoGP, in 2019. To date, he has celebrated five wins and four further podium finishes in MotoGP. Now, Oliveira is opening a new chapter in his career: as a BMW Motorrad Motorsport factory rider in WorldSBK 2026.\n\nAt the same time, talks are being held with Michael van der Mark (NED) about continuing the collaboration in other projects. He has been a factory rider with BMW Motorrad Motorsport since 2021 and has competed with the ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team since then.\n\n“Bem-vindo à família, Miguel,” says Sven Blusch, Head of BMW Motorrad Motorsport. “We are very happy to welcome Miguel Oliveira as a new factory rider for our ROKiT BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Miguel has impressively proven throughout his career that he belongs to the most talented and versatile riders of his generation. With victories in all three Grand Prix classes, including five in MotoGP, he brings valuable experience and a high level of professionalism to our project. Together with Danilo Petrucci, his new teammate, he forms a strong and competitive rider duo. The two already know each other well. This constellation gives us the opportunity to take the next steps in our development and to further reinforce BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s ambitions in WorldSBK. The entire team is very much looking forward to working with him. But for now, our focus is on the remaining races of this season, with big goals: we want to win the world championship title again with Toprak Razgatlioglu and build on Michael van der Mark’s strong performance at Magny-Cours in order to also play a decisive role in the battle for the manufacturers’ title. Michael’s time in our WorldSBK project will come to an end after this season. I would like to sincerely thank him for his commitment, his successes and his achievements during his five years in our WorldSBK team. We are currently working on opportunities for further collaboration with him within the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family and would be delighted to move into a new future together with him.”\n\nOliveira says: “To join the BMW family in the World Superbike Championship is an exciting step in my career, one in which I see tremendous potential. I am becoming part of a project that is not only ambitious and competitive, but has also made a significant impact on both the championship and the motorcycle industry. Being involved with a new team, working alongside strong partners, and embracing a new championship format gives me great motivation to deliver my very best. I want to sincerely thank Mr. Sven Blusch, Technical Director Chris Gonschor and Team Principal Shaun Muir for their trust and enthusiasm. I can’t wait to begin this new chapter together.”"

      "content": "Debrecen. With an impressive ceremony that artistically combined Hungarian culture and modern automotive production, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, today officially opened the BMW Group plant in Debrecen. The BMW Group’s newest and most innovative production site marks the beginning of a new era for the company. In late October, the new BMW iX3 will enter series production in the Hungarian university town of Debrecen as the first vehicle of the Neue Klasse. Plant Debrecen was planned virtually and realised in practice fully in line with the principles of the BMW iFACTORY, becoming the first BMW Group car plant to rely entirely on electricity from renewable energy during normal operation.\n\nIn addition to Oliver Zipse, high-ranking representatives from Hungarian politics, such as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and the Mayor of Debrecen, László Papp, as well as Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management for Production, Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management for Human Resources and Real Estate, and Hans-Peter Kemser, President and CEO BMW Manufacturing Hungary Kft., attended the grand opening.\n\n“In our global production network, our new plant in Debrecen is a pioneer: It is our first fully-electric plant, the first production site to operate entirely without fossil fuels – and the first to build vehicles for the Neue Klasse. This makes our plant in Debrecen a decisive factor in the BMW Group's future success,” said Oliver Zipse. “The opening also sends a strong signal: We are expanding our footprint on our home continent and reaffirming our commitment to Europe as a strong and competitive location for industry.”\n\nHans-Peter Kemser added at the ceremony: “This is not only a new BMW Group plant – it is a cornerstone of progress. We are a partner to culture, to education and to the University of Debrecen, where together we foster the talents that will shape the future. And above all, it is a community – deeply embedded in the life of Debrecen and Hungary.”\n\nStrengthening the industrial base and expanding training\n\nThe official opening ceremony began with a look back at the plant’s construction, following a 2018 decision that launched one of Hungary’s largest greenfield investments. The BMW Group’s first Central European location has firmly placed Debrecen on the region's automotive map, creating more than 2,000 direct jobs – and many more along the supply chain, at regional suppliers and service providers that have recently established themselves in Debrecen, alongside national and international companies. The new plant has also strengthened the industrial park and driven additional investment in transport and infrastructure.\n\nAt the same time, through collaborations with institutions such as the local university and the Vocational Training Centre of Debrecen, DSZC, Plant Debrecen has also become one of the largest training hubs for dual education programmes in Hungary.\n\nOnly the best of the best for Debrecen\n\nPlant Debrecen is the first BMW Group production site not tied to a specific primary plant. Instead, it serves as a network plant, combining best practices from different locations worldwide. For example, the press shop is modelled on the systems used in Spartanburg (USA) and Swindon (Great Britain), with their know-how and technologies further refined for Debrecen. In the body shop, the positioning of nearly 1,000 industrial robots, along with their processes, was digitally simulated in detail beforehand. The number of joining methods was also significantly reduced, with further streamlining allowing design features for the Neue Klasse to be integrated early in development.\n\nPaint shop key to largest reduction in CO2e emissions\n\nAt BMW Group Plant Debrecen, the paint shop plays a critical role in significantly reducing the BMW iX3’s CO2e footprint. Production of the new BMW iX3 will generate a total of about 80kg CO₂e (scope 1/2 emissions). This figure covers CO₂e emissions from Plant Debrecen, as well as in-house parts production at other BMW Group facilities, including components manufactured in Landshut, for example. This represents a reduction of approx. two-thirds compared to production of existing BMW derivatives. For Plant Debrecen alone, this approach will reduce CO₂e emissions from the manufacture of a vehicle, including its high-voltage battery, by around 90% – to about 34 kg CO₂e (when operating at full capacity, compared with other BMW Group facilities).\n\nAbout a quarter of the plant's annual power needs will be supplied by the 50‑hectare on-site photovoltaic system, one of the largest in Hungary. Surplus solar energy, such as that generated on non-working days, is stored in a 1,800 m³ thermal storage system with a capacity of 130 MWh.\n\nDigitalised assembly processes and smart “finger structure”\n\nComplete digitalisation of production processes further boosts assembly efficiency – for example, sensors and camera systems along the production line are used to automate quality processes. AI evaluates the data and provides real-time feedback to employees on the assembly line. The building's “finger structure” – an optimised version of BMW Group Plant Leipzig – allows 80% of parts to be delivered directly to the correct point of assembly on the line. In-house logistics are fully electric.\n\nHigh-voltage battery assembly in line with “local for local” principle\n\nHigh-voltage batteries are assembled directly on site, allowing for short distances in line with the “local for local” principle. Plant Debrecen will be the first of five plants worldwide to begin series production of Gen6 high-voltage batteries at this location. Seamless in-line quality inspections and 100% end‑of‑line monitoring enable a consistent zero-defect approach.\n\nFinal photo with employees and two BMW iX3s\n\nThe opening ceremony concluded with a music and dance performance celebrating Hungarian culture and traditions, which the BMW Group also supports through local events and organisations. To wrap up, numerous employees joined Viktor Orbán and Oliver Zipse on stage, alongside two new BMW iX3s.\n\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: WLTP energy consumption combined: 17,9 - 15,1 kWh/100 km; WLTP CO₂ emissions combined: 0 g/km; CO₂-class: A; WLTP electric range: 679 - 805 km"

      "content": "Milan. In the heart of the Abruzzo National Park, “Stasis” – the new installation by Velasco Vitali for ARTEPARCO – has been unveiled. The project, which for the past eight years has been transforming nature into an open-air museum, introduces many innovations in its 2025 edition, including an interactive web app and a short film resulting from the collaboration between BMW Group Italia, Main Partner of the initiative, and Scuola Holden.\n\nARTEPARCO is an initiative launched in 2018 that highlights the unique landscape of the Abruzzo National Park, Lazio e Molise through contemporary art interventions. It also celebrates the synergy between culture and environmental sustainability.\n\nBMW Italia has reaffirmed its commitment to this project through 2025, supporting its evolution into a true open-air museum that guides visitors in discovering artworks situated within the heart of the Park. Recognized for its dedication to territorial enhancement, the initiative benefits from the Patronage of the Ministry of Environment and Energy Security.\n\nStarting from Pescasseroli (AQ), visitors can explore the Park’s trails, C1 and C2, and encounter works by artists with diverse stylistic backgrounds who have engaged with this pristine environment over the years, including Marcantonio, Matteo Fato, Alessandro Pavone, Sissi, Valerio Berruti, Accademia di Aracne, and megx.\n\nOn July 18th, the eighth edition of ARTEPARCO was unveiled, featuring Velasco Vitali’s “Stasis” (born in Bellano, 1960), a prominent figure in contemporary Italian art. Inspired by the Ancient Beech Forests, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the artist created a piece that pays homage to the Park’s fauna. The artwork transforms a raw oak trunk into a natural column, crowned by a depiction of an Apennine wolf—symbolizing nature and serving as a metaphor for modern society, which is still on a journey of discovery.\n\nConceived by Abruzzese entrepreneur and communicator Paride Vitale, ARTEPARCO has become a well-established event in contemporary art, with aspirations to evolve into an open museum without walls.\n\nThe initiative is promoted by BMW Italia within the framework of Corporate Citizenship, under the campaign \"SpecialMente #Drivenbypeople,\" aiming to build a robust cultural and sustainable network.\n\nIn 2025, the program introduced innovative features for visitors, including a web app accessible via arteparco.com. This digital platform allows users to explore the Park’s route and artworks through an interactive map and specially designed audio guides narrated by Victoria Cabello – Italian - British actress and television presenter – and Paride Vitale.\n\nFurthering its commitment to storytelling and social responsibility, BMW Italia partnered with the Scuola Holden to produce a documentary capturing the key moments of the “Stasis” installation.\n\nA young team from the Scuola produced an evocative long-form video that explores the main themes of the 2025 edition. This includes insights into the project's inception and the dialogue between the artist and the Park’s collaborators involved in integrating the artwork among the beech trees along the trail. The film, available on BMW Italia’s Specialmente.bmw.it website and on arteparco.com, presents the interpretation of the project through a dedicated and unique viewpoint.\n\nIn addition to the long video, the SpecialMente website features five other episodic videos that highlight the individuals involved with the Park—those who, every day, contribute with pride to its preservation and conservation. These stories are shared through communication videos published on the BMW Group Italia LinkedIn channel, showcasing the diverse efforts supporting the Park’s safeguarding.\n\nVelasco Vitali “Stasis”Inspired by the Ancient Beech Forests—designated as a UNESCO World Heritage SiteVin 2017—Vitali’s \"Stasis\" pays tribute to the Park’s wildlife. The piece references stylites, ascetics from antiquity who lived atop columns or pillars in prayer and spiritual elevation. It reflects on the concept of balance, intertwining physical and contemplative dimensions, and is connected to the artist’s \"Torre\" series, created between 2005 and 2010.\n\nThe artwork features a semi-worked, raw oak trunk transformed into a natural column, topped with an acanthus leaf-capital. At its summit stands an Apennine wolf, embodying the wildness of nature and serving as a metaphor for contemporary society’s ongoing quest for awareness and understanding. Vitali describes his vision: “For the Ancient Beech Forests of the Park, I envisioned a symbolic sculpture as a starting point for a journey where each individual leaves their mark, testifying to their bond with the land. It’s an invitation to craft a ‘geography of the mind,’ composed of connections, exchanges, and awareness of our existence.”\n\nElements of the sculpture, cast in aluminum at the historic Fonderia Artistica Battaglia in Milan, are designed to age naturally, with a patina that will develop an elegant patina over time, allowing the environment to further enhance Vitali’s work.\n\nPositioned discreetly within a secluded clearing at the end of a Park trail, \"Stasis\" harmoniously integrates into the landscape, exemplifying a meaningful synthesis of art and nature.\n\nThe BMW Group's cultural engagement, including exclusive updates and deeper insights into its worldwide cultural initiatives, can be followed on Instagram at @BMWGroupCulture."

The German basketball champions enjoyed a successful start to the new season. At the national league opener, fans at BMW Park celebrated a 93-77 FC Bayern Basketball victory over newly promoted Science City Jena. For the third year of the partnership between BMW Munich and FC Bayern Basketball, dunks count twice at home games: once for the result and once for charity, the BMW initiative ‘Dunks for Tomorrow’. The 1,000 euros per home game dunk scored by the Bayern basketballers, with which BMW Munich supports the charitable organisation DEIN MÜNCHEN, will be going towards the new project ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ as of this season. Young people are key for the future but youths from difficult backgrounds are lacking contacts, opportunities and spaces in which they can develop a positive perspective. Which is where ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ steps in.\n\nThe name being inspired by ‘Dunks for Tomorrow’ highlights the close ties with BMW Munich’s social commitment. “We’re delighted to be providing DEIN MÜNCHEN with long-term support through the ‘Dunks for Tomorrow’ initiative and in doing so to be facilitating a totally new programme within the organisation,” said Bernd Döpke, Head of BMW Munich. “In the successful collaboration with DEIN MÜNCHEN and FC Bayern Basketball, we are taking the next step to make a difference in our home city of Munich in the long term and to create future opportunities for young people who come from challenging environments. This also promotes team spirit and contributes to a vibrant and strong city community.”\n\nMara Bertling, founder and managing director of DEIN MÜNCHEN, adds: “In this project we are arousing curiosity, fuelling courage through positive role models, boosting self-confidence, and opening up prospects. This enables young people to identify their own strengths and develop an approach with which they can play an active role in shaping their future and our community. My thanks go to BMW Munich. The long-term commitment secures the funding of ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ and we – like FC Bayern Basketball – can enter the new season today with big ambitions We want to reach up to 4,000 young people with the programme.”\n\nThe ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ project is divided into three phases. In the first step, around 40 young people will be trained as multipliers and motivators. They will acquire skills in areas such as project management and communications, as well as creativity and strategy development. In the second phase, these 40 young people, who act as an authentic voice for their peer group, will hold more than 30 creative initiatives like workshops, flash mobs, art campaigns, and sporting events at schools, youth centres and in public spaces. Up to 4,000 youths shall be reached under the slogan ‘Boss Your Own Future’.\n\nThe final project module will be an urban, public event at which the young people will present the projects and ideas they have developed to showcase their potential and prove that they can play an active role in shaping society when they are empowered to do so. ‘Minds for Tomorrow’ teaches young people from disadvantaged backgrounds that it is worth them taking control of their own future and working to shape it positively. The BMW Group will support all three project phases and even provide employees as mentors."
