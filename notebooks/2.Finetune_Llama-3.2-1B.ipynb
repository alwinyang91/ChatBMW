We are very proud of this long-standing partnership that is never at a standstill, it gives plenty of fresh momentum each year. With the most innovative technologies, BMW M is taking care of safety in our sport for the 25th year now, and is a firm fixture in the MotoGP paddock with a wide range of activities. Here’s to a fantastic anniversary season in 2023!”\\n\\n“2023 is our 25th season as Official Car of MotoGP – a long-standing, close partnership like this is special in international racing,” added Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “We would like to thank Dorna Sports for the great trust they have placed in us for a quarter of a century now. Since 1999 we have been striving to incorporate our values such as innovation, technology, emotion, and passion into our partnership with Dorna Sports as well. Our new BMW M2 MotoGP safety car is just one example of this. With it we are continuing our tradition of putting the latest BMW M high-performance automobiles at the service of MotoGP safety. Be it the safety car fleet, the BMW M Award, or our many other activities in the top level of motorcycle racing – we are proud that Fascination M has become an important part of the MotoGP.”\\n\\nThe new BMW M2 impresses with the traditional characteristics of a high-performance sports car – in a concentrated form and with state-of-the-art technology. With its compact dimensions and the 460 hp TwinPower turbo in-line 6-cylinder engine, the new BMW M2 is the perfect basis for a BMW M safety car. The BMW M2 was kitted out with various safety car elements for its deployment on MotoGP™ racetracks. These elements include a roll bar, RECARO seats, 6-point racing harness, a fire extinguisher, the safety car roof bar, and the matching front light. Several M Performance parts, such as exhaust system, chassis, carbon wing mirror covers, diffusor, and rear wing have also been installed. The BMW M2 MotoGP™ safety car will have the standard BMW M safety car livery. In addition to the new BMW M2 MotoGP™ safety car, the safety car fleet of 2023 also includes many other BMW M safety, medical and official cars, as well as BMW M 1000 RR safety bikes.\\n\\nFor more information about BMW M GmbH and the involvement as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’, see: \\n\\nCO2 Emissions & Consumption: BMW M2: combined fuel consumption in accordance with WLTP: 9.8 – 9.6 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions in accordance with WLTP: 222 – 218 g/km; details as per NEFZ: –',\n",

The BMW Group Supplierthon with a focus on the “Metaverse and other Virtual Experiences” is starting today. The aim is to attract researchers, startups and pioneering tech leaders from within the global Metaverse community in order to gain an outside-in perspective. Application here: Link to Metaverse Supplierthon The Metaverse is the next iteration of the internet: a single, shared, persistent, immersive, 3D virtual space where humans experience life in ways they could not in the physical world. The Supplierthon will empower applicants to bring their innovative and visionary ideas for the Metaverse to life. Experts from the BMW Group have identified challenges in three different areas (for details see below): Vehicle Readiness, In-Car Experience and Virtual Ecosystems. The BMW Group believes that virtual experiences could make a significant difference by strengthening the entire customer experience and the product substance and could have an impact on the whole automotive industry in the future. Registration begins today and the first deadline for submission is March 15, 2023. The ideas that are submitted will be examined and judged by a panel of experts who will select the finalists. They will proceed to the second round, where the ideas will be developed further to produce real business solutions by May 10, 2023. The second round will end with a pitch event where the finalists will present their solutions to a panel of experts before the winners are selected on May 24, 2023. The winners will have the opportunity to partner with the BMW Group and will also be involved in the implementation of pilot projects. The BMW Group is a pioneer when it comes to virtualization and is now taking one step further The Supplierthon for the “Metaverse and other Virtual Experiences” highlights the fact that the BMW Group is playing a leading role in efforts to bring the next level of digitalized human interaction to life. The BMW Group is generating value by consistently developing greater interaction and more immersive experiences using XR1 and Web 3.0, building on a vivid landscape of use cases, some of which are already connected, along the entire value chain. To ensure that its solution is coherent, the BMW Group is currently developing a strategic, centralized Metaverse Platform. In December 2022, the company became one of the first automotive manufacturers to join the Metaverse Standards Forum. The company takes a holistic approach across three strategic dimensions: a Corporate Metaverse, a Commercial Metaverse and an In-Car Metaverse, as recently demonstrated by the BMW i Vision Dee vehicle and its Mixed Reality Slider, which was presented at the CES in Las Vegas. The Metaverse Supplierthon will focus only on in-car use cases. “From our perspective, our industry is in the process of a step by step transformation, shifting human experiences into a virtual world driven by the metaverse.” says Rudi Bencker, Senior Vice President Global Research, Tech Offices and Development Cooperations. “With this Crowd Innovation Challenge we want to take the next step and invite the global metaverse community to share their innovative and visionary approaches within the Metaverse spectrum.” says Florian Weig, Senior Vice President Purchasing and Supplier Network Digital. Specific Challenges for the Metaverse Supplierthon\\n\\n1Extended Reality (XR): Multisensory extended reality integrates Mixed Reality (MR), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and the five traditional senses, including sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. 2 Augmented Reality (AR) describes the computer-aided extension of reality perception. 3 Virtual Reality (VR) is the representation and simultaneous perception of an apparent reality and its physical properties in a real-time computer-generated, interactive virtual environment. 4 Mixed Reality (MR) comprises environments or systems that mix natural and artificial perception.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nLaunch of a Supplierthon for the „Metaverse and other Virtual Experiences” to crowd-source Innovation – apply now!<|eot_id|>'"
